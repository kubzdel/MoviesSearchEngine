==Plot==
In 1971, a young girl, Lucie Jurin, escapes from a disused [[Slaughterhouse|abattoir]] where she has been imprisoned and physically abused for more than a year. The perpetrators and their motivations remain a mystery. Lucie is placed in an orphanage, where she is befriended by a young girl named Anna Assaoui, who quickly discovers that Lucie believes that she is constantly being terrorized by a ghoulish creature - a disfigured, emaciated woman. Even so, Anna comforts Lucie every time she has a nightmare.

Fifteen years later, Lucie bursts into the home of an apparently normal family, the Belfonds - Gabrielle, her husband, and their children Antoine and Marie - and kills them all with a shotgun. Elsewhere, Anna waits for Lucie. Although Anna knows that Lucie believes the Belfonds are the people responsible for her childhood abuse, she is horrified when Lucie tells her that she has killed them. Upon arriving at the house, Anna discovers that Gabrielle is still alive and tries to help her escape, but Lucie bludgeons Gabrielle to death. Lucie is again attacked by the scarred creature, but Anna only sees Lucie hurting herself; the 'creature' is nothing more than a psychological manifestation of Lucie's guilt for leaving behind another girl who was also tortured with her as a child. Lucie, realizing that her insanity will never leave her, commits suicide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northlander interviews MARTYRS' Pascal Laugier - and he spills about his HELLRAISER remake!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/39602|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|publisher=Ain't It Cool, Inc.|accessdate=22 November 2013|date=28 December 2008}}</ref>

The next day, Anna, still at the family's house, telephones her mother, from whom she has been estranged; their conversation implies that Anna suffered abuse from her parents as a child. Suddenly, Anna hears some noises and discovers a secret underground chamber in the living room. Imprisoned within is a horribly tortured young woman named Sarah, who proves that Lucie was right about the family. Anna helps Sarah escape, but a group of strangers arrive and gun Sarah down. Captured, Anna meets their leader, an elderly lady referred to as Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle explains that she belongs to a secret philosophical society seeking to discover the secrets of the afterlife through the creation of "martyrs". Their experiments inflict systematic acts of torture upon young women in the belief that their suffering will result in a [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] insight into the world beyond this one. Mademoiselle also believes the world is divided into victims (people who can't hold tortures and fall into madness, like Lucie and Sarah) and martyrs (people who "accept" tortures and transcend).

Anna becomes the group's latest subject. After a period of being beaten and degraded, Anna hallucinates a conversation with Lucie, and is later told she has progressed further than any other test subject, and has reached the "final stage." She is [[Flaying|flayed]] alive and survives the procedure, entering a state that is "euphoric" and likened to achieving transcendence. Mademoiselle arrives eagerly and Anna whispers into her ear.

Members of the society gather at the house to learn of the insights Anna shared with Mademoiselle. As he waits, Mademoiselle's assistant asks her if what Anna said was clear. Mademoiselle says yes, then asks him if he could imagine what comes after death. When he says no, she tells him to "keep doubting" before producing a handgun and committing suicide.

The film ends with a shot of Anna on the table, in a catatonic state.

[[File:Pascal Laugier.jpg|thumb|Director Pascal Laugier.]]

[[Pascal Laugier]] said that "the film was rejected by all the big French studios, by a lot of actresses, too. […] The film was really supported by [[Canal+]], the only television channel in France that still finances some unusual projects". He also comments that the main difficulty other than the technical issues such as [[special effect]]s was to keep the [[actress]]es crying all the time, and that was too demanding.<ref name="shock">{{cite web|url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=6654 |last=Rotten |first=Ryan |title=Exclusive Interview: Martyrs Director Pascal Laugier |publisher=shocktillyoudrop.com |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=25 June 2008}}</ref>

==Remake==
{{main|Martyrs (2015 film)}}
In 2008 original director Pascal Laugier confirmed in an interview that he was in the middle of negotiating the rights for ''Martyrs'' to be remade in [[United States|America]].<ref>[http://www.aintitcool.com/node/39602 Ain't It Cool News: Northlander interviews MARTYRS' Pascal Laugier - and he spills about his HELLRAISER remake!!]</ref> It was to be directed by [[Daniel Stamm]], director of ''[[The Last Exorcism]]'', and written by [[Mark L. Smith]], writer of ''[[Vacancy (film)|Vacancy]]'' as well as from the producers of ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]''. The producer of the film said he would like ''Twilight'' actress [[Kristen Stewart]] for the film,<ref>[http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b19324_exclusive_twilight_producer_wants.html Exclusive: 'Twilight' Producer Wants Kristen Stewart for 'Martyrs' Remake]</ref> though her presence in the film was later denied by Stamm.<ref name="LA Times">{{cite news|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=French horror hit 'Martyrs' will undergo an American exorcism|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/11/martyrs-remake-pascal-laugier-daniel-stamm.html|accessdate=22 November 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=15 November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.morehorror.com/Martyrs-to-Get-American-Makeover511911 More Horror News: 'Martyrs' to Get American Makeover]</ref> Stamm said "[The original film] is very nihilistic. The American approach [that I'm looking at] would go through all that darkness but then give a glimmer of hope. You don't have to shoot yourself when it's over."<ref name="LA Times"/>
 
In a 2014 interview, Stamm revealed he had left the project after the budget had been reduced, stating, "I think they're now back to making the movie for like $1 million, really low budget, which I think you could almost do, it's just there's this philosophy in [[Hollywood]] that you can never go back budget-wise. As a filmmaker you are judged by that. And then there's also this concept I was unaware of called plateauing, where if you're a filmmaker who makes two movies in the same budget bracket, that becomes your thing. You are the guy for the $3 million movie, and then that's all you do. And so my agents wouldn't let me do the $1 million movie, because then that's it for you, you'll supposedly never get that bigger budget".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.movies.com/movie-news/martyrs-remake-daniel-stamm-details/15385?wssac=164&wssaffid=news|title = What Happened to the Remake of ''Martyrs''?
