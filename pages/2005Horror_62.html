'''''Dracula III: Legacy''''' is a 2005 [[horror film]] and the sequel to ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' and ''[[Dracula II: Ascension]]''. The film was directed by [[Patrick Lussier]] and stars [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Jason London]], [[Roy Scheider]], and [[Diane Neal]]. It was released [[direct-to-video]] on July 12, 2005.

The role of Dracula is played by [[Rutger Hauer]], following [[Gerard Butler]] in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' and [[Stephen Billington]] in ''[[Dracula II: Ascension]]'', continuing the theme of Dracula's appearance changing due to "regeneration". Hauer had played vampires before, in ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'' and in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and he would later go on to portray Dracula's nemesis [[Abraham Van Helsing]] in [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Dracula 3D]]'' (2012).

==Plot==
Five years after the events of ''[[Dracula II: Ascension]]'', Father Uffizi and Luke ([[Jason London]]) discover that Dracula ([[Rutger Hauer]]) has returned with Elizabeth ([[Diane Neal]]) to his castle in the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. However, fearing that Uffizi has been tainted by Dracula, Cardinal Siqueros ([[Roy Scheider]]) refuses to give Uffizi his blessing for the mission. Uffizi defrocks himself and sets out with Luke to Bucharest.

Romania has been devastated by a civil war, and [[NATO]] peacekeepers line the streets. In an abandoned village, Uffizi and Luke find a crashed helicopter containing a news reporter, Julia ([[Alexandra Wescourt]]), and her cameraman. The cameraman is turned by the vampire clowns terrorising the village, but all are destroyed by Uffizi and Luke. They leave Julia but are soon lured into a rebel trap. They find Julia with the rebels, refusing to return to [[England]] with nothing but a story on vampires.

The undead attack the rebel base during the night, but Uffizi, Luke and Julia survive, proceeding to Dracula's castle. There they find Elizabeth, almost totally turned to Dracula's way of life. Dracula mortally wounds Julia and tells Uffizi that only through God's forgiveness can he truly die, but Uffizi engages the ancient vampire in a duel and ultimately destroys him by first biting him and draining him of his blood, then beheading him, announcing that he should consider himself forgiven. Meanwhile, Luke, on her request, beheads Elizabeth. Luke leaves the castle, while Uffizi sits on Dracula's throne, with Julia revived as a vampire. The film ends with the implication that Uffizi, who has missed the morning purge of his vampiric curse, has become the new vampire lord.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to ''Dracula III: Legacy'' has been mixed, though more positive in general than that of ''[[Dracula II: Ascension]]''. John Puccio of ''DVD Town'' said, "This one is no world beater and hardly scary, but at least it's got mood and tone and atmosphere to spare, something the first two movies in the ongoing series lacked entirely. ... ''Dracula III: Legacy'' contains some decent acting and some solid atmospherics."<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> Kevin Carr of ''7M Pictures'' said, "At least in the cinematic morass that is modern movies, ''Dracula III'' is better than the wimpy vampire lore pioneered by [[Anne Rice]]. ... ''Dracula III'' falls somewhere below ''[[Hellraiser]]'' but above the ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|Crow]]'' sequels. It's not a grand placement, but there's always a market for vampire movies."<ref>{{cite web

Walter Chaw of ''Film Freak Central'' said, "The strength of ''Dracula III'' is in its use of locations, with Lussier finally figuring out how to work with a [[director of photography|DP]] to create a foreboding atmosphere. ... If reports are true and this is Lussier's last dip in the Carpathian pool, at least he's ending somewhere just north of mediocre."<ref>{{cite web

Each shot is brimming with authentic feeling vampire flavor, at times achieving an almost [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Film]] type ambiance. Truly inspired stuff."<ref>{{cite web
