'''''Arachnoquake''''' is a 2012 made for television horror film that aired on [[Syfy]].

==Reception==
A review from ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' says, "Arachnoquake is too hilarious and good-natured to be offensive and, for SyFy, it’s a quantum leap in quality from last year’s dire ''[[Camel Spiders (film)|Camel Spiders]]'' and is cautiously recommended for lovers of unpretentious throwaway big insect movies."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-review-arachnoquake |title=DVD Review: Arachnoquake |website=Starburst |access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref> Craig McGee, of Horror News, wrote, "The easiest way I can sway you into my way of thinking with this movie is if you didn’t enjoy the SyFy Original, CAMEL SPIDERS, from last year then you’re not going to go for this one either."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://horrornews.net/55966/film-review-arachnoquake-2012/ |title=Film Review: Arachnoquake (2012) |last=McGee |first=Craig |date=August 20, 2012 |website=Horror News |access-date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>

The spiders of ''Arachnoquake'' were featured in the book ''[[How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaffer |first=Andrew |date=July 8, 2014 |title=How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFqVAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT21&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false |publisher=Crown/Archetype |isbn=9780553418149}}</ref>
