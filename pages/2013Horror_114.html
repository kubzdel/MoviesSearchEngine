==Plot==
"A Young boy's discovery of a mysterious gas mask provides a glimpse into an alternate reality."

==Critical reception==
[[Huffington Post]] featured an in-depth review by music Journalist  Morena Duwe, who wrote: "Whisking you away with its sweeping cinematography, the film was well edited, elegantly directed, and hypnotically choreographed to a riveting soundtrack. Indigo Grey: The Passage is a truly one-of-a-kind project that merges the worlds of film, dance, sci-fi, art and music. With its lack of dialogue, the young Lok's budding acting performance is extremely impactful as he relies solely on his emotional expression and movement to carry the narrative. A lavish feast of sensory stimulation, this short film has successfully captured the attention of its viewers by transporting them to another dimension and most impressively, all within its humble seven minutes." <ref>{{cite web|title=Indigo Grey: The Passage Features a New Style of Dance and Soundtrack by Amy Lee|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morena-duwe/indigo-grey-the-passage-f_b_8317906.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>The film won the Thelma K.
