==Plot==
<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->
After finishing a long shift as a nurse, Ana returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband, Luis. Caught up in a scheduled date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, a neighborhood girl enters their bedroom and kills Luis, who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking, Ana joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombified security guard, who scratches Luda. Three living guards—C.J., Bart, and Terry—make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot.

The next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. C.J. and Bart wish to turn them away but are overruled and disarmed. The newcomers include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside via wheelbarrow, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Andre leaves to see Luda, who has kept her scratch hidden from the group. They realize that Frank has been bitten and is a potential threat. After some debate, Frank elects to be isolated.  When he dies and turns, Kenneth shoots him. 

Kenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance also buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, CJ, Bart, Michael and Kenneth go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator; they find a friendly dog and worry about a breach. Zombies attack and kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda—tied up by Andre—gives birth and dies. She reanimates as Norma checks on the couple. When Norma kills the zombified Luda, Andre snaps; they exchange gunfire and both are killed. The others arrive to find a zombie baby, which they kill immediately. The group decides to fight their way to the local marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on [[Lake Michigan]]. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape.

To rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows through the dog door. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation via the buses.

While navigating through the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica; blood splatters on the windshield, causing their bus to crash. Steve tries to flee on his own, but is ambushed by a zombie. While C.J., Kenneth, and Terry look for survivors, Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht. Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows Steve's escapades before the outbreak and concludes as the group runs out of supplies, arrives at an island, and is attacked by a swarm of zombies.  The camcorder drops, leaving their fate unknown.

==Production==
===Development===
Plans to remake [[George A. Romero]]'s 1978 [[cult film|cult]] horror film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'' was conceived by producer [[Eric Newman (producer)|Eric Newman]].<ref name="production">{{cite web|title=Dawn of the Dead - Production Notes|url=http://madeinatlantis.com/movies_central/2004/dawn_production_details.htm|website=Media Atlantis|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> A fan of the original film, Newman offered [[Strike Entertainment]]'s [[Marc Abraham]] to produce the remake with him, which Abraham accepted. He and Abraham secured the rights to the film after it was handed over by [[Richard P. Rubinstein]], the original's producer.<ref name="production"/> Rubinstein stated that he finally agreed to grant the rights after several years because he was worried "that somewhere along the way a studio would sanitize Newman's vision for producing a version with 'attitude'," as Romero's film was independently produced. In addition, the producer was impressed by Abraham's "long track record in keeping the creative integrity of the studio distributed films he has produced intact".<ref name="production"/>

Newman and Abraham said that the new ''Dawn of the Dead'' is more of a "re-envisioning" of Romero's film which is geared toward younger audiences who had not seen the original. Newman stated that the production's goal is "to make the old fans happy and make a lot of new fans. Because that's the only reason we are doing it." He cited his favorite classic horror films ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1978), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), and  ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986) as cinematic influences, explaining that these had "some amazing updates" which "add to rather than diminish the original films".<ref name="production"/> In search of a screenwriter, Rubinstein hired [[James Gunn]], an avid fan of the original, who began writing a draft. [[Michael Tolkin]] and [[Scott Frank]] were brought in for rewriting after Gunn left the project to concentrate on ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004). Rubinstein stated that Tolkin further developed the characters while Frank provided some of the bigger, upbeat action scenes.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Dawn of the Dead: Ultimate Edition (Disc 2: Extended Version) |type=audio commentary |people=[[Richard P. Rubinstein]] (producer) |publisher=[[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Starz/Anchor Bay]]}}</ref>

===Filming and design===
[[Principal photography]] lasted nearly three months, in the period from June 9 to September 6, 2003, on location in various parts of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Director Zack Snyder [[storyboard]]ed the film extensively.<ref name="production"/> 

Andrew Neskoromny supervised the production design, which included the construction of the fictional mall dubbed as "Crossroads Mall".<ref name="production"/> Neskoromny researched malls that were scheduled to be demolished in such countries as Romania, Japan, and the United Kingdom, but yielded no results.<ref name="production"/><ref name="surviving">{{cite video|title=Surviving the Dawn|type=featurette|publisher=[[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment]]|people=Zack Snyder (director), et al. |date=2004 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}</ref> In Canada, however, the crew had located the defunct Thorn Hill Square shopping mall in [[Thornhill, Ontario]], the area of which measured approximately {{convert|45,000|sqft|acre}}, and eventually used this location.<ref name="production"/> The crew completely renovated the structure over an eight-week period; the remodeled mall comprised, among other things, an expensive [[water feature]] near the entrance, 14 individually designed stores, parking structures and warehouse areas.<ref name="production"/> According to Snyder, the stores had to be renamed as [[Starbucks]] and numerous other corporations refused to let their names be used (save for [[Roots Canada|Roots]] and [[Panasonic]]<ref name="surviving"/>): "People were like 'do we want to be in this movie where blood gets sprayed all over our thing?

Baffico|Jim Baffico]]'s character role Wooley.<ref name="production"/>

==Release==
In the United Kingdom, ''Dawn of the Dead'' and ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' were originally scheduled to be released the same week, but due to the similarity in the names of the two films and plot outline, [[United International Pictures|UIP]] opted to push back ''Shaun''{{'s}} release by two weeks. It was screened out of competition at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="festival-canuses.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/awshives/ficheFilm/id/4199281/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dawn of the Dead |accessdate=December 5, 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] said the film "works and it delivers just about what you expect when you buy your ticket" but felt that it "lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version" and the "plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040319/REVIEWS/403190301 |title=Review |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=March 19, 2004 |accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref>  Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as an unnecessary remake that will appeal mostly to young adult audiences who have not seen the original film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/dawn-of-the-dead-2-1200534414/|title=Review: 'Dawn of the Dead'|last=Foundas|first=Scott|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 18, 2004|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>  Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film "has no patience for such subtleties" as Romero's thematic concerns or suspense-building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-114922215/dawn-dead|title='Dawn of the Dead'.(Movie Review)|last=Rechtshaffen|first=Michael|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=March 19, 2004|accessdate=March 6, 2015|via=[[Highbeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}</ref>  [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2004/03/19/movies/19DAWN.html|title=A Cautionary Tale for Those Dying to Shop|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis|authorlink=Elvis Mitchell|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 19, 2004|accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>  [[Manohla Dargis]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Good zombie fun, the remake of George A.

[[George A. Romero]] said, "It was better than I expected. ... The first 15, 20 minutes were terrific, but it sort of lost its reason for being. It was more of a video game.

==Comparisons to the original==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2015}}
In the original film, the [[zombie]]s moved very slowly and were most menacing when they collected in large groups. In the remake, the zombies are fast and agile. Many admirers of the original, as well as Romero himself, protested this change, feeling that it limited the impact of the undead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |title=John Leguizamo on Land of the Dead |work=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029040534/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |archivedate=October 29, 2008 }}</ref> This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the remake has almost no close-up shots of zombies that last more than a second or two. Snyder mentions this in the commentary track of the remake's DVD, pointing out that they seem too human when the camera lingers upon them for longer. However, it was for this change that Wizard Magazine ranked the zombies #5 on their "100 Greatest Villains Ever" list.

The original had a smaller cast than the remake, allowing more screen time for each character. Many fans and critics criticized the resulting loss of character development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |title=Dawn of the Dead |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123512/http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In the original version, the story unfolds over several months, indicated by the advancing stages of Fran's pregnancy. In the remake, the events transpire within approximately one month, as evidenced by the supplemental feature ''[[The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed]]'', located on the DVD in the special features section. Another big change from the original is that unlike Romero, Snyder treats zombification more like a disease, pointing to the bites as the source, instead of anyone who is dead turning into a zombie.

Three actors from the original film have cameos in the remake, appearing on the televisions the survivors watch: [[Ken Foree]], who played Peter from the original, plays an evangelist who asserts that God is punishing mankind; [[Scott H. Reiniger]], who played Roger in the original, plays an army general telling everyone to stay at home for safety; and [[Tom Savini]], who did the special effects for many of Romero's films and played the motorcycle gang member Blades in the original ''Dawn of the Dead'', plays the Monroeville Sheriff explaining the only way to kill the zombies is to "shoot 'em in the head". Monroeville is also the location of the mall used in the 1978 film. In addition, a store shown in the mall is called "Gaylen Ross", an obvious tribute to actress [[Gaylen Ross]], who played Francine in the original film. In the beginning of the film, a helicopter that is very similar to the one in the original flies across the screen.

In ''The Zombie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said that the original film "served as a bridge between the talky, slow-paced 1970s horror and the fast-paced splatter to come in the 1980s", whereas the 2004 remake "generally forsakes slow-mounting suspense in favor of frenetic action".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000–2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=49–51|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>

==Cancelled and potential sequel==
A [[sequel]] was planned but was later cancelled.<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/dawn-of-the-dead-sequel-army-of-the-dead-will-not-renimate Dawn of the Dead sequel Army of the Dead will not reanimate]</ref> [[Zack Snyder]] stated that he would only be producing the sequel instead of reprising his role as the director due to working on ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' when he announced the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |title=Zack Snyder NOT directing "Army of the Dead" |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |work=bloodydisgusting.com |date=June 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603222919/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> The script of ''Army of the Dead'' was written by Zack Snyder and [[Joby Harold]].
