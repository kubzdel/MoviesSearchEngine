'''''1408''''' is a 2007 American [[psychological horror]] film based on [[Stephen King]]'s 1999 [[1408 (short story)|short story of the same name]]. It is directed by [[Mikael Håfström]] and stars [[John Cusack]], [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Mary McCormack]], [[Tony Shalhoub]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Isiah Whitlock, Jr.]], and [[Jasmine Jessica Anthony]]. The film was released in the United States on June 22, 2007, although July 13 (which in 2007 [[Friday the 13th|fell on a Friday]]) is mentioned as the release date on the website.

The film follows Mike Enslin, an author who investigates allegedly haunted houses and rents the titular room 1408 at a New York City hotel. Though skeptical of the paranormal, he is soon trapped in the room where he experiences bizarre events. Reviews were mostly positive and the film was also a financial success.

==Plot==
Mike Enslin is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], [[Skepticism|skeptical]] author who is estranged from his wife Lily after the death of their daughter Katie. Mike writes unsuccessful books evaluating supernatural events in which he has no belief. After his latest book, he receives an anonymous postcard depicting The Dolphin, a hotel on [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[New York City]] bearing the message, "Don't enter 1408." Viewing this as a challenge, Mike arrives at The Dolphin and specifically requests to book room 1408.

The [[hotel manager]], Gerald Olin, initially refuses Mike's request until Mike references a law that any hotel room in [[New York (state)|New York]] can be requested as long as it meets safety standards. Attempting to discourage him, Gerald explains to Mike that in the last 95 years, no one has lasted more than an hour inside of Room 1408; the latest count is 56 deaths, both suicides and "natural" deaths. The horrors began with a [[Upper class|wealthy]] businessman named Kevin O'Malley, who inexplicably committed suicide in the room when the hotel opened. Mike appears unmoved by the story, so Gerald attempts to bribe him a very expensive bottle of cognac to prevent him from entering 1408. Accepting the bottle, Mike still insists on staying in the room and hotel staff reluctantly make the preparations.

Once inside the room, Mike describes on his [[mini-cassette]] recorder the room's boring appearance and its unimpressive lack of supernatural behavior. During his examination, the clock radio starts playing "[[We've Only Just Begun]]", a hit song by [[The Carpenters]]. Mike assumes that Olin is pulling a prank to scare him. At 8:07, the song plays again and the clock's digital display changes to a countdown starting from "60:00." The window slams down and wounds his hand. He begins to see hallucinations and ghosts of the room's past victims, and visions of his own dead family members, including his father and Katie. Mike's attempts to leave are in vain: the brass room key breaks and is sucked into the lock and the doorknob falls off; climbing through the air ducts prompts an attack from the corpse of O'Malley; and when he tries to escape to an adjacent room by walking along the outside window ledge he sees the windows of the other rooms have disappeared.

Mike uses his laptop to contact Lily, pleading with her to call the police, but the sprinkler system [[short circuit]]s his laptop. The room temperature drops to subzero when the laptop suddenly begins to work again, and Lily tells him the police have entered 1408, but the room is empty. A [[doppelgänger]] of Mike appears in a video chat window and urges Lily to come to the hotel herself; it gives Mike a sly wink. The room shakes violently and Mike breaks a picture of a ship in a storm. Water pours from the broken picture, flooding the room. He surfaces on a beach and relives a surfing accident seen earlier in the film. His life continues from this point, and he reconciles with Lily.

Assuming his experience in 1408 was just a [[nightmare]], Lily encourages him to write a book about it. When visiting the post office to send the manuscript to his publisher, he recognizes members of a construction crew as Dolphin Hotel staff. They demolish the post office walls, revealing Mike is still trapped in the rubble of 1408. Katie's ghost confronts Mike, and after some reluctance he embraces her, but she dies and crumbles to dust. When the countdown ends, the room is suddenly restored to normal, and the clock radio resets itself to 60:00.

The "hotel operator" calls Mike. When Mike asks why he hasn't just been killed already, "she" informs him that guests enjoy free will, and as such he can relive the past hour over and over again, or use their "express checkout system". A [[hangman's noose]] appears and Mike has a vision of himself hanged, but he refuses to give in. Deciding to quit running, Mike improvises a [[Molotov cocktail]] from a bottle of [[cognac]] given to him by Olin, and sets the room on fire. The fire alarm sounds, the hotel is evacuated, and Lily is prevented from entering. After smoking a [[cigarette]], Mike breaks a window, causing a [[backdraft]]. Mike then lies down on the floor and laughs in victory upon destroying the room. Two firemen break into the room and drag him out, and he warns them to not go in. Olin, in his office, says "Well done, Mr. Enslin".

Mike survives, and he and Lily are seen back together in their home, although she is unsure of the supernatural events he has explained to her. Lily finds a box of Mike's possessions that were rescued from 1408 and suggests disposing of them. Mike takes the mini-cassette recorder from the box, saying, "Sometimes you can't get rid of bad memories. You've just got to live with them." Lily now realizes Mike is ready to move on from his daughter's death. Suddenly they hear Katie's voice on the recorder, confirming his account.

==Alternate endings==
In addition to the ending that appears in the theatrical release version, three other endings were shot.  The incentive for filming three alternate endings was based on the director's belief that King's intention, in his original short story, was to leave the conclusion ambiguous. None of the four endings match the ending of King's original short story.

===Original ending (unused)===

Director [[Mikael Håfström]] said that the ending for ''1408'' was reshot because test audiences felt that the original ending was too much of a "downer."<ref>[http://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/Advance-Hint-At-1408-DVD-Contents-4676.html Advance Hint At 1408 DVD Contents], ''DVD News''.</ref> This first alternate ending was used in the theatrical release. The original discarded ending had Mike dying in the fire, but happy to see the room destroyed. During Mike's funeral, Olin approaches Lily and Sam. He unsuccessfully attempts to give her a box of Mike's possessions, including the tape recorder. Olin claims that the room was successfully destroyed and that it will no longer hurt anyone else. He later listens to the recording in his car, and becomes visibly upset when he hears Katie's voice on the tape. He looks in the car rear-view mirror and sees a little girl walking on the cemetery grass behind the car, in a dress, calling out as if she's lost. He shifts his gaze to the back seat, and sees Enslin's burnt but alive corpse in the back seat. Then he sees the same girl holding hands with her father as they walk away. Olin places the tape recorder back in the box and drives off. The final scene is of the gutted room, where an apparition of Mike looks out the window while smoking a cigarette. He hears his daughter calling his name, and he disappears as he walks toward her. A door is heard closing and the scene fades to black.

This ending is the default ending on the Blu-ray release and two-disc collector's edition. Canadian networks [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]] and [[The Movie Network]], and U.S. network FX broadcast this version of the film, but Space broadcast the theatrical ending on July 23, 2012. This ending is also used on the U.K. and Australian DVDs, and the U.S. iTunes, Netflix and Amazon Prime versions of the film.

===Second alternate ending===

Another ending uses elements from both the theatrical ending and the discarded original ending. Mike dies in the fire; afterwards Olin remarks, "Well done, Enslin. Well done." Instead of the funeral scene, the sounds of a funeral are dubbed over establishing shots of [[Los Angeles]]. Lily and Sam sort through Mike's effects in Lily's new home. Sam says, "Well, at least he went out in a blaze." Lily gives him a look of disapproval. Sam returns to his New York office, sorts through his mail, and discovers the manuscript that Mike wrote about Room 1408, written after Mike thought he had awakened from a dream. As Sam reads the story, audio from Mike's experiences in the room is heard. In a final scene, Sam's office doors slam shut and Mike's father's voice says, "As I was, you are. As I am, you will be."

===Third alternate ending===

In a third alternate ending, Mike survives and moves to Los Angeles with Lily. When he plays the tape of Katie's voice from 1408, Lily hears it and looks shocked. Mike stares at Lily strangely. This is the ending shown on the Australian streaming service Presto and on Netflix in Japan. Netflix in the Netherlands used to show this ending, however Netflix changed it to the ending used in the theatrical release.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 79% based on 170 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads "Relying on psychological tension rather than overt violence and gore, ''1408'' is a genuinely creepy thriller with a strong lead performance by John Cusack."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1408/ |title=''1408'' – Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2007-11-03 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101072455/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1408/ |archivedate=1 November 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film had an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 27 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/1408 |title=1408 (2007): Reviews |accessdate=2007-10-16 |website=[[Metacritic]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113134513/http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/1408 |archivedate=13 November 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B-" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

[[James Berardinelli]] awarded the film three stars out of four, praising it as "the best horror film of the year." He offered significant praise for Cusack's performance as Mike Enslin, writing that "this is John Cusack's movie to carry, and he has no problem taking it where it needs to go." He found the film to be a refreshing experience, believing it "reminds us what it's like to be scared in a theater rather than overwhelmed by buckets of blood and gore".<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/f/1408.html Review: 1408<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Many critics believed the film to be far superior to other adaptations of Stephen King novels and stories. Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote a very positive review, describing the film as "one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's sly sense of humor and satiric view of human nature". He ultimately believed the film to be a "more genuinely scary movie than most horror films".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/06/22/DDGMVQHUUE14.DTL&ytpe=movies | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Checkout time? Much sooner than you think | first=Mick | last=LaSalle | date=2007-06-22| accessdate= 13 May 2008 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref>

Several critics, however, found the film to be underwhelming. Wesley Morris of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote a mixed review, describing the film as "a lot of consonants and no vowels." He went on to compare the film unfavorably to ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', a similar King adaptation, believing ''1408'' lacked that film's "lunging horror and dramatic architecture." Although he believed the film "conjures a wonderful anticipatory mood of dread in the first 30 minutes," he ultimately believed the film "then blows it to stylish smithereens".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/movies/display?display=movie&id=9186 | work=The Boston Globe | title=As thrillers go, '1408' leaves too much room for fun | first=Wesley | last=Morris | date=2007-06-22| accessdate= 13 May 2008 <!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> Rob Salem of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' awarded the film two stars out of four, believing it to be a predictable, "hit and miss" production. Like Morris, Salem wrote that "Even as haunted hotel King movies go, ''1408'' is certainly no ''Shining''. Not even [[The Shining (TV miniseries)|the TV-movie version]]."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/228197 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title='1408': Hoary movie | first=Rob | last=Salem | date=2007-06-22 | accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref>
