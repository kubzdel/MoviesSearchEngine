==Plot==
After the events of the [[Ginger Snaps (film)|first film]], Brigitte Fitzgerald uses [[monkshood]] extract to fight the effects of the [[lycanthropy]] that transformed her sister into a [[werewolf]].  After a second injection causes toxic shock, Brigette collapses in the snow and is brought to a rehab clinic, from which she unsuccessfully attempts to escape. She pleads to be released, but the clinic's director Alice refuses.  Tyler, a worker at the clinic, offers to trade monkshood for sexual favors, which she declines. As her healing rate accelerates, so does her rate of transformation. Ginger continues to appear, taunting Brigitte as she experiences growing cravings for sex and murder, as did Ginger previously. 
While at the clinic, a girl named Ghost – the granddaughter of Barbara, a severe burn victim at the hospital – shadows Brigitte and realizes her secret. <ref>{{cite news|last1=Lacey|first1=Liam|title=Ginger Snaps II: Unleashed|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/ginger-snaps-ii-unleashed/article1126820/|accessdate=4 February 2018|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=Jan 30, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McDonagh|first1=Maitland|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/ginger-snaps-2-unleashed/review/289390/|website=TVGuide|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref>

Brigitte and Ghost escape the clinic through air vents and the old hospital's crematorium, pursued by a male werewolf.  The next day, they arrange a meeting at a gas station with Tyler to procure more monkshood and all three of them return to Barbara's house to inject the monkshood — which Brigitte's body rejects. Worried that Brigitte is OD'ing, Tyler calls Alice. Ghost tricks Brigitte into thinking that Tyler abused her, and Brigitte locks Tyler outside, where the werewolf kills him. When Alice arrives, Ghost mistakes her for the werewolf, and attacks her with Barbara's hunting rifle. Meanwhile, Brigitte realizes that Tyler did not abuse Ghost, and that Ghost herself burnt Barbara.

Brigitte, whose transformation is almost complete, fights the werewolf. As they struggle, they both fall into the basement, where the werewolf is impaled on a prepared trap. Instead of helping or killing her with the rifle, Ghost pushes Brigitte back down and locks the basement. In the final scenes, Ghost is shown to keep Brigitte in the basement as a werewolf pet waiting to be unleashed on her enemies.

[[Ernest Mathijs]], in his book ''John Fawcett's Ginger Snaps'', wrote that the sequel is "more radical and nihilist". He identifies the major themes as [[self-harm]], [[drug addiction]], and deconstruction of the themes explored in the first film.<ref>{{cite book|title=John Fawcett's Ginger Snaps|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=9781442615670|year=2013|pages=118–119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RW-1AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA118}}</ref>
