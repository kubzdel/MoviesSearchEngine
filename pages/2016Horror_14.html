But it belies its modest budget to splatter to knowing effect."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/attack-lederhosen-zombies/review/ |title=Attack of the Lederhosen Zombies|last=Parkinson|first=David|website=Empire |access-date=2017-03-06}}</ref> ''[[SciFiNow]]'' espoused a similar view, commenting that it "at least tries to do something a bit different with a subgenre that long became saturated past the point of no return. It falls firmly into the ‘disposable fun’ category, but ultimately it isn’t much more than that."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.scifinow.co.uk/reviews/attack-of-the-lederhosen-zombies-film-review/|title=Attack Of The Lederhosen Zombies film review|work=SciFiNow|access-date=2017-03-06|language=en-GB}}</ref>
