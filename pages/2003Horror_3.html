The Heidelberg chapter of the Anti-[[Hippocratic Oath|Hippocratic]] Society for unrestricted medical research has been shut down, but at a prestigious Berlin hospital the society still thrives. The young neurosurgeon Jo from Duisburg gets caught up in a research group led by doctor Mueller LaRousse, who urges his students to test their progress on themselves.
