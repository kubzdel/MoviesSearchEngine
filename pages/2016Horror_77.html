== Plot ==
The [[Fantasy|fantasy]] film follows twelve-year-old girl Mira Gonzaga who has been having terrible dreams after a [[traumatic brain injury]] of an undisclosed origin. Taking care of Mira and his pregnant wife, Jesús Gonzaga moves the family away from the city to a secluded [[ranch]] in the [[Texas]] hill-country. Mira soon discovers that the ranch is just as far from safety. She has vivid night dreams, sees her deceased grandmother and a monster who claims to be her soon-to-be-born brother. There are several hints in the movie that these strange occurrences are taking place as a result of poisoned water from nearby [[Hydraulic fracturing in the United States|fracking operations]].

After Mira's mother dies and Jesús tries to feed Mira poisonous wild boar meat, their neighbor Dimitri comes and saves her, chasing Jesús until giant [[drilling rig]]s explode.

Film production spanned over seven years from inception to distribution. The original script was written as a horror film while the director was still in college.  After producer Jonathan de la Luz came on board the project, the script was rewritten, embracing the eco-thriller genre with fracking as the primary threat in the film.<ref>
