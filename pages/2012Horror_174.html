==Plot==
The plot revolves around the titular Smiley killer, the subject of an [[Urban legend#Internet urban legends|Internet myth]]. Supposedly, if a person on a [[Chatroulette]]-style website types the phrase "I did it for the [[LOL|lulz]]" three times, their chat partner will be murdered by a killer called Smiley, so named because he mutilated his own face by stitching his own eyes shut and [[Glasgow smile|carved his mouth into a smile]], before they themselves are killed.

A college student named Ashley (Gerard) becomes roommates with Proxy (Papalia). Ashley decides to go to a party where she meets Zane (Allen), Mark (Turner) and Binder (Dawson), who is mocked by his classmates for having reported a case of pedophilia, earning him the nickname [[Pedobear]].

One night Ashley and Proxy test out the Smiley myth with a random person online. After typing "I did it for the lulz" three times, to their horror, the stranger is murdered. Proxy convinces Ashley to stay silent. However, Ashley begins experiencing guilt over the stranger's death. She also begins to believe that Smiley is stalking her and intends to kill her; her friends and a psychiatrist write this off as anxious hallucinations and nightmares. Ashley eventually goes to the police; there she tries to convince them, to no avail, to investigate the murders caused by Smiley. The police basically dismiss her, implying that she is going crazy and quite possibly on the receiving end of a large, elaborate prank.

When Proxy loses contact with Zane, she video chats Ashley, in hysterics. Ashley goes to his house to check on him, only to find him shot dead with a handgun he purchased for self-defense. Instead of calling the police, Ashley picks up the gun and orders Proxy to type "I did it for the lulz" three times, hoping to ambush and kill Smiley. However, she accidentally shoots Binder, who had been coming over to check on her. Moments later, Smiley appears and slits Binder's throat. Ashley is then attacked by multiple Smileys, finally throwing herself out a window to her presumed death to escape them.

It is then revealed that all Ashley's classmates, including Proxy, Binder, and the babysitter murdered in the opening, are all part of a fringe group of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. They created the Smiley myth as a large-scale prank, although they are satisfied with Ashley's death. Binder states that Smiley will likely live on long after them and inspire copycat killings.

Later, Proxy is video-chatting with Zane, questioning their morality. Zane dismisses her worries and types "I did it for the lulz" three times as a joke. However, a real Smiley appears behind Proxy, kills her, and then waves at Zane via webcam. In a [[post-credits scene]], Ashley is revealed to have survived her fall.

==Reaction from 4chan and Anonymous==
Prior to the film's official theatrical release Gallagher and his family began receiving threats from people alleging to be from [[4chan]] and [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].<ref name=PM /> Personal information for Gallagher, his family, and anyone that had worked on ''Smiley'' was posted online with the recommendation that people use it to harass them.<ref name=FN>{{cite web|last=Wax|first=Alyse|title=Exclusive: We Talk Trolls and Death Threats With 'Smiley' Director Michael Gallagher|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/exclusive-we-talk-trolls-and-death-threats-smiley-director-michael-gallagher|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Fearnet]]'', Gallagher stated that the site had posted the information as part of "Operation Fuck Smiley" and that "Their goal was to spoil the end of the movie, post pornography and gore on any website that talks about it, rate the movie really low... it was this horrible vendetta, like they wanted to destroy it because we talked about 4chan in the movie."<ref name=FN /> The validity of these claims were questioned by Cole Strycker, author of ''Epic Win for Anonymous'', who expressed suspicion that Gallagher was trying to use the death threats as a publicity stunt to promote the film.<ref name=PM /><ref name=HP>{{cite web|title=Michael Gallagher Says 4Chan Sent Death Threats About Horror Flick|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/08/4chan-michael-gallagher-death-threats_n_1949749.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=February 21, 2014}}</ref> In response Gallagher asserted that the death threats were real and were not being used as a publicity stunt.<ref name=PM />

[[Bloody Disgusting]] panned the film, stating that the writers "took a strong, modern idea, over-thought it and turned it into a generic '90s movie that'll have you throwing popcorn at the screen".<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Smiley|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/3193475/smiley/?tab=bd-review|work=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> ''Variety'' called the film "uninspired", saying that "the mayhem here is neither especially gory nor suspenseful".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Smiley|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948466?refcatid=31|work=Variety|accessdate=October 13, 2012}}</ref> Mark Olsen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave a more positive review, calling the film a "more or less satisfying low-key creeper".
