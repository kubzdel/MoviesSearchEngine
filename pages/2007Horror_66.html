'''''Dead Mary''''' is a 2007 [[slasher film]] from 235 Films starring [[Dominique Swain]] as Kim.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dead Mary|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/380856/Dead-Mary/overview}}</ref>

==Plot==
A young woman and a group of her school friends embark on a holiday weekend at a lakeside cabin to reminisce about their college days, only to run afoul of an evil spirit.

==Trivia==
The original [[screenplay]] was entitled ''Bloody Mary''. The title was cleared in every territory except Japan, where the name Bloody Mary is copyrighted, and it was suggested that the title be changed to Dead Mary for release in that country alone. When the film's producers discovered that another film, also called Bloody Mary, was being readied for release around the same time, it was decided that the film's title be officially changed to Dead Mary in order to avoid confusion. This spawned an inside joke in the finished film, when the [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|better-known game Bloody Mary]] is dismissed as being "the lame version" of Dead Mary.
