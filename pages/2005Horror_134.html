==Plot==
Whilst growing up in rural Thailand, a young orphan girl named Dau ([[Suangporn Jaturaphut]]) is taught the ways of magic by her grandmother. But when grandmother falls sick, Dau is lured to Bangkok to find work so that she can buy medicine. She finds herself working in a go-go bar, and her journey from naivet√© to maturity is swift. She uses the magical skills her grandmother taught her to her advantage, but in doing so makes enemies within the bar. As her magic gets darker, and the consequences increasingly horrific, she gradually loses control, and something evil takes over.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/16-dvd-a-blu-ray/4346-weekly-dvd-a-blu-ray-chopping-list-10202009-.html Weekly DVD & Blu-Ray Chopping List 20 October 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021133419/http://fangoria.com/home/news/16-dvd-a-blu-ray/4346-weekly-dvd-a-blu-ray-chopping-list-10202009-.html |date=21 October 2009 }}</ref>
