It also allows Eric to spend more time with his student assistant Olivia, as the two are engaged in an extramarital affair and their assignment will leave them in almost complete seclusion from the outside world. Once arrived, strange occurrences and malfunctioning equipment begin to cause Eric's mind to unravel.
