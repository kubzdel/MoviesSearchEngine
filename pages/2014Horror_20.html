==Plot==
The film follows a [[riot squad]] that enters an insane asylum to try to deal with a hostage situation involving some of the inmates. The group is quickly overwhelmed by the patients, who quickly attack the squad members. The resulting chaos causes the group to lose two of their members and the situation turns more tense when they realize that they are completely cut off from the outside world. Not only are all of the doors locked, but none of their communication devices seem to work properly. It is at this point that they realize that they aren't fighting against normal mental patients, but ones that have been possessed by a dark and evil force. Things take a darker turn when one group member discovers that the leader of this group is his own brother.

==Production==
The film's script was written by horror writer and director Chris Mancini, who pitched ''Asylum'' to After Dark. Mancini intended to serve as the movie's director, only for After Dark to instead assign Chapkanov as the movie's director and move the film's production to [[Bulgaria]].<ref name="DVDV">{{cite web|last1=Loomis|first1=Darryl|title=Asylum (review)|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/asylum2014.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=9 May 2016}}</ref><ref name="IM" /> Mancini's script was heavily re-written and altered from its original state and according to some review websites such as [[DVD Verdict]] and HorrorNews.net, After Dark enlisted Mancini to insert comedy into the film in an effort to salvage the production due to them seeing Chapkanov's finished film as poor in quality.<ref name="DVDV" /><ref name="HNN" /> 

==Reception==
''Influx Magazine'' panned ''Asylum,'' writing that ""It’s ultimately a rather weak affair (and really difficult to grade knowing the average viewer walking into this coldly will have an entirely different take on the result), but despite the best efforts of Mancini and friends to salvage this mess, I think the patient is lost and they should have just pulled the plug."<ref name="IM">{{Cite web|url=http://influxmagazine.com/asylum-review/|title=Asylum (Review)|last=Rector|first=Rob|website=INFLUX Magazine|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref> HorrorNews.net criticized the film as being "a mess, from the moment the film starts, you can see it and feel it".<ref name="HNN">{{Cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/92688/film-review-asylum-2014/|title=Film Review: Asylum (2014)|last=Danna|first=Corey|date=2014-12-17|website=Horrornews.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-09}}</ref>
