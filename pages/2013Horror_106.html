'''''Horns''''' is a 2013 American [[dark fantasy]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Alexandre Aja]], loosely based on [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]]'s [[Horns (novel)|novel of the same name]]. [[Daniel Radcliffe]] stars as a man accused of raping and murdering his girlfriend ([[Juno Temple]]), who uses his newly discovered [[paranormal]] abilities to uncover the real killer.

The film had its [[Film premiere|world premiere]] at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]], and was released theatrically in the United States on October 31, 2014.

==Plot==
Ignatius "Ig" Perrish is the prime suspect when his girlfriend, Merrin, is raped and murdered. Despite his declarations of innocence, he is shunned by the community. He stays with his parents and brother, Terry, hiding from the press. After a vigil led by Merrin's father, who believes Ig to be guilty, Ig drinks heavily, urinates on Merrin's memorial, and wakes up with a pair of horns protruding from his head.

While seeing his doctor about getting the horns removed, Ig, under [[anesthesia]], dreams of his childhood, when he first met Merrin. A young Ig and his friends play with [[cherry bomb]]s; Ig risks a dangerous dare to win a cherry bomb, and nearly drowns, but is saved by Lee, his childhood friend and now-lawyer. He later trades the cherry bomb to Lee in exchange for fixing Merrin's broken necklace, and Lee loses two fingers when the cherry bomb goes off accidentally. Ig and Merrin bond over the fixed necklace and fall in love, frequenting a treehouse in the woods together.

It is revealed that Ig's horns force people to tell him their darkest secrets and desires, which, at Ig's bidding, they act upon. Ig visits his parents, but under the power of the horns his mother reveals that she doesn't want him as her son, while his father tells him that he is worthless without Merrin and that a friend of his helped him burn down the lab where DNA tests were being conducted. Ig goes to a bar, where he goads the reporters into a brawl and attempts to find evidence that he didn't kill Merrin. Several people confess their deepest secrets, and the bartender burns down the building.

From one of the confessions Ig learns that a new witness in the case is a waitress at the diner where Merrin broke up with him the night she died. Ig finds her and discovers that she has been fabricating her stories to become famous. When Ig talks to Terry, he learns that Terry drove Merrin from the diner the night she died. When he touches Terry, Ig sees what happened that night: Merrin left the car en route to her home and ran into the woods; Terry passed out in the car, and woke up the next morning with a bloody rock in his hand, finding Merrin dead under the treehouse. Afraid that he would be implicated, he fled. Infuriated, Ig assaults Terry until he is arrested by Eric Hannity, a police officer and another childhood friend. The next morning Ig is released from jail with Lee's help. He discovers that because Lee is wearing Merrin's cross necklace he cannot see Ig's horns.

Ig realizes that snakes are following him wherever he goes, and uses them to exact vengeance against the waitress. He also gets Eric to act on his feelings for his police partner (who reciprocates his feelings) and forces Terry to overdose on drugs, causing Terry to be tormented by memories of Merrin's death. Ig meets Lee by the docks and pulls off Merrin's necklace; exposed to the horns, Lee falls under their influence, admitting he killed Merrin. In flashbacks, it is shown that Lee was also in love with Merrin and was deeply jealous of Ig throughout their childhood. Lee followed Merrin into the woods, thinking that she had broken up with Ig to be with him, and in a jealous rage raped her, killed her with a rock, planted it on Terry, and stole her necklace. In the ensuing confrontation, Lee overpowers him and lights him on fire in his car, causing Ig to drive into the bay. Lee claims that Ig confessed to the crime and committed suicide. The horns allow Ig to survive, horrifically burned and disfigured.

Merrin's father, who now believes Ig innocent, gives Ig the key to Merrin's lockbox. When Ig puts on Merrin's cross, his body is restored and his horns disappear. In the box, he finds a note from Merrin that explains that she knew he was going to propose, but she was dying from cancer and didn't want him to suffer, so she pushed him away under the pretense of loving someone else.

Ig confronts Lee, who does not remember their earlier fight, and leads him into the woods where Merrin was killed. Eric and Terry arrive to arrest Lee. Lee confesses to the murder, but then gleefully kills Eric and injures Terry. Ig tears off the necklace, sprouting a pair of wings and bursting into flame, transforming into a demonic monster. Despite Lee mortally wounding him, Ig impales Lee on one of his horns and telepathically forces a snake down Lee's throat, killing him. Saying that his vengeance was all-consuming, Ig dies from his injuries and his smoldering corpse turns to hardened ash, and he appears to be reunited with Merrin in the afterlife.

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Recpeption}}
''Horns'' received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives a 41% approval rating based on 112 reviews with an average rating of 5.2/10. The consensus says "Horns is a bit of a tonal jumble, but it offers enough thoughtful horror-comedy—and strong work from Daniel Radcliffe—to hook genre enthusiasts."<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|horns}}</ref>

John DeFore of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave a positive review of the film, remarking, "While this all begins as a kind of supernatural black comedy ... the tone grows darker with each revelation".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/horns-toronto-review-625746|title=Horns: Toronto Review|first=John|last=DeFore|date=September 10, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013}}</ref>

[[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], who wrote the novel the film is based on, praised Radcliffe's performance, calling it a "wrenching, vulnerable, emotionally naked performance that isn’t like anything he’s ever done on screen before. He is such a wonderful Ig Perrish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joehillfiction.com/2013/09/the-devil-is-in-toronto-im-in-baltimore/|title=The Devil is in Toronto; I’m in Baltimore|first=Joe|last=Hill|date=September 5, 2013|publisher=joehillfiction.com|accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the film two out of five stars, calling it "a ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''-style mash-up of grim comedy and religious satire".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/07/horns-review-daniel-radcliffe-toronto|title=Horns: Toronto 2013 - first look review|first=Henry|last=Barnes|date=September 7, 2013|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> Eric Kohn of ''[[IndieWire]]'' wrote, "Predominantly a failure of tone, "''Horns''" has plenty of admirable traits and yet dooms itself from the outset.
