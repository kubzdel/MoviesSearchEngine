==Plot==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
In Japan, Kiriko ([[Hikari Mitsushima]]) and her younger half-brother Daigo ([[Takeru Shibuya]]) live with their father Kohei ([[Teruyuki Kagawa]]) who is a book illustrator. One day Daigo inexplicably beats a rabbit to death outside his school and subsequently stops attending classes. Kiriko becomes worried by Daigo's behaviour while their father ignores the problem as he is caught up in latest job: a pop-up book about ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. Later, Kiriko takes Daigo to watch the [[3-D film|3-D]] [[horror film]] ''[[The Shock Labyrinth]]'' involving a rabbit doll which appears to float out of the screen and into Daigo's hands. Daigo takes it home. That night a large version of the doll pulls him through a cupboard into a fairground. The next night Daigo is pulled by the rabbit through the mattress of his bed. Kiriko follows him this time and the group goes to an abandoned hospital. Later, Kiriko tells her father that "Kyoko is coming. I saw her. Daigo too." Kiriko then recalls when she was younger and Kohei brought home his pregnant second wife, Kyoko. Kiriko attacked Kyoko and now Kiriko and Daigo seem to believe that Kyoko has come back to haunt them in a rabbit costume and are determined to destroy the doll.
