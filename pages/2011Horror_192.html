== Plot ==
Ana Maria, a battered wife, seeks help from a local spiritualist, Roque.  Impressed with Roque's community service and advocacy for women, a filmmaker, Pilar Franco, offers to make a documentary about him.  Roque, however, is a fake and can offer Ana Maria little help beyond advice to leave her abusive relationship; Pilar is disgusted and denounces him as a con man.

In desperation, Ana Maria turns to Luna, a voodoo priestess, who warns her that her husband, Antonio, will be changed by the dark magic. To Ana Maria's surprise, Antonio is transformed into a mindless slave.  Unsure what to do, Ana Maria returns to Roque and seeks his help once again. Roque and Pilar team up to help Ana Maria discover what happened to Antonio.  Together, they learn that Luna is creating slave labor out of the immigrant community now that her supply of illegal immigrants has dried up. These zombies are put to work on Luna's farm and mindlessly follow her orders, including the murder of her enemies. A mix of [[Haitian vodou|Haitian voodoo]] and undead ghoul, the zombies are nearly impossible to destroy. Eventually, a botched spell destroys the zombies and Luna is killed.  Roque and Pilar, who have come to respect each other, decide to work together to help the community.
