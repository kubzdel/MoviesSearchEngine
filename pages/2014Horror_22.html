The film stars [[Essie Davis]], Noah Wiseman, [[Daniel Henshall]], [[Hayley McElhinney]], Barbara West, and Ben Winspear.

''The Babadook'' was initially not a strong commercial success in Australia and was given a limited release in [[Art film|art house]] theatres.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/29/the-babadooks-monster-uk-box-office-success-highlights-problems-at-home|title=The Babadook's monster UK box office success highlights problems at home|work=The Guardian Australia|date=29 October 2014|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> However, largely after its strong reception at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.filmink.com.au/news/two-aussie-features-selected-for-sundance/ | work=[[Filmink]] | first=Eden | last=Caceda | title=Two Aussie Features Selected For Sundance | date=9 December 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627074856/http://www.filmink.com.au/news/two-aussie-features-selected-for-sundance/ | archivedate=27 June 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/babadook-sundance-review-673048 | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | first=David | last=Rooney | title=''The Babadook'': Sundance Review | date=21 January 2014}}</ref> the film generated more attention in the United States and Europe, garnering very positive reviews and grossing $7.5 million against a $2 million budget.

==Plot==
<!-- As of August 2016, this summary has over 402 words, is generic and DOES NOT EXCEED 400-700 WORDS per WP:FILMPLOT!! -->
Amelia Vanek is a troubled and exhausted widow who has brought up her six-year-old son Samuel alone. Her late husband, Oskar, was killed in a car accident that occurred as he drove Amelia to the hospital during her labour. Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour: he becomes an insomniac and is preoccupied with an imaginary monster, against which he has built weapons to fight. Amelia is forced to pick up her son from school after Sam brings one of the weapons there. One night, Sam asks his mother to read a [[Pop-up book|pop-up storybook]] called ''Mister Babadook.'' It describes the titular monster, the Babadook, a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with taloned fingers who torments its victims after they become aware of its existence. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is real. Sam's persistence about the Babadook leads Amelia to often have sleepless nights as she tries to comfort him.

Soon after, strange events occur: doors open and close mysteriously by themselves, strange sounds are heard and Amelia finds glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam's behaviour, but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby bullies Sam for not having a father, in response to which he pushes her out of her tree house and breaks her nose in two places. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam to which Amelia takes great offence. On the drive home, Sam has another vision of the Babadook and suffers a [[febrile seizure]], after which Amelia makes a successful plea for sedatives to a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]].

The following morning, Amelia finds the ''Mister Babadook'' book reassembled on the front door step. New words taunt her by saying that the Babadook will become stronger if she continues to deny its existence, containing pop-ups of her killing her dog Bugsy, Samuel and then herself. Terrified, Amelia burns the book and runs to the police after a disturbing phone call. However, Amelia has no proof of the stalking, and when she then sees the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk, she leaves. Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, being more impatient, shouting at Samuel for 'disobeying' her constantly, and having frequent visions of the Babadook once again. Her mental state slowly decays further and she exhibits erratic and violent behaviour, including severing the phone line with a knife and brandishing it aggressively at Sam seemingly without realising. This mental decline culminates in several disturbing hallucinations, most of which involve the violent murder of Sam with herself as the willing perpetrator.

Shortly after these visions, Amelia sees an apparition of Oskar, who embraces her benevolently and agrees to return. However, he then demands that Amelia "give(s) him the boy" in return, implying he is a conjuration of the Babadook. Fleeing, Amelia is stalked by the Babadook through the house until it takes over her and finally possesses her. Under its influence she breaks Bugsy's neck and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out. A tied-up Amelia awakens with a terrified Sam nearby. When she tries to strangle him, he lovingly caresses her face, causing her to regurgitate an inky black substance, an action which seemingly expels the Babadook. When Sam reminds Amelia that "you can't get rid of the Babadook", an unseen force drags him into Amelia's bedroom. After saving Sam, Amelia is forced by the Babadook to re-watch a vision of her husband's death to her utter despair. She then furiously confronts the Babadook, and is able to make the beast retreat into the basement, where she locks the door behind it.

After the ordeal, Amelia and Sam have managed to recover. Amelia is attentive and caring toward him, encouraging him with the weapons he makes and being impressed at Sam's magic tricks. They gather earthworms in a bowl and Amelia takes them to the basement, where the Babadook resides. She places the bowl on the floor for the Babadook to eat. However, as the beast tries to attack her, Amelia calms it down, and it retreats to the corner taking the earthworms along with it. Amelia returns to the yard to celebrate Sam's birthday.

==Production==

===Development===
Kent studied at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA)—where she learned acting alongside Davis—and graduated in 1991.<ref name="Lui" /> She then worked primarily as an actor in the film industry for over two decades. Kent eventually lost her passion for acting by the end of the 1990s and sent a written proposal to Danish filmmaker [[Lars von Trier]], asking if she could assist on the film set of von Trier's 2003 drama film, ''[[Dogville]]'', to learn from the director. Kent's proposal was accepted and she considers the experience her film school, citing the importance of stubbornness as the key lesson she learned.<ref name="Den" /><ref name="Paul">{{cite news|author1=Paul MacInnes|title=The Babadook: 'I wanted to talk about the need to face darkness in ourselves'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/18/the-babadook-jennifer-kent|accessdate=21 November 2014|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2014}}</ref>

Prior to ''Babadook'', Kent's first feature film, she had completed a short film, titled ''Monster'', and an episode of the television series ''Two Twisted''. Kent explained in May 2014 that the origins of ''Babadook'' can be found in ''Monster'', which she calls "baby ''Babadook''".<ref name="San">{{cite web|author1=Sandy George|title=How Jennifer Kent made The Babadook|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2014/05/21/how-jennifer-kent-made-babadook|website=SBS|publisher=SBS|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=21 May 2014}}</ref>

The writing of the screenplay began in around 2009 and Kent has stated that she sought to tell a story about facing up to the darkness within ourselves, the "fear of going mad" and an exploration of parenting from a "real perspective". In regard to parenting, Kent further explained in October 2014: "Now, I'm not saying we all want to go and kill our kids, but a lot of women struggle. And it is a very taboo subject, to say that motherhood is anything but a perfect experience for women."<ref name="Den">{{cite web|author1=Ryan Lamble|title=Jennifer Kent interview: directing The Babadook|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/the-babadook/32451/jennifer-kent-interview-directing-the-babadook|website=Den Of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing Limited]]|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=13 October 2014}}</ref> In terms of the characters, Kent said that it was important that both characters are loving and lovable, so that "we [audience] really feel for them"—Kent wanted to portray human relationships in a positive light.<ref name="Den" /> In total, Kent completed five drafts of the script.<ref name="Alt">{{cite web|author1=Ethan Alter|title=Parental descent: Jennifer Kent's 'The Babadook' is a spooky tale of a mother in crisis|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3icebb717e84f08bc21ecace8c6a04a7b0|website=Film Journal International|publisher=Film Journal International|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=14 November 2014}}</ref>

Kent drew from her experience on the set of ''Dogville'' for the assembling of her production team, as she observed that von Trier was surrounded by a well-known "family of people". Therefore, Kent sought her own "family of collaborators to work with for the long term." Unable to find all of the suitable people within the Australian film industry, Kent hired Polish director of photography (DOP) Radek Ladczuk, for whom ''Babadook'' was his first-ever English language film, and American illustrator Alexander Juhasz.<ref name="San" /> In terms of film influences, Kent cited 1960s, '70s and '80s horror—including [[The Thing (1982 film)|''The Thing'']] (1982), [[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'']] (1978), [[Eyes Without a Face|''Les Yeux Sans Visage'']] (1960), [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'']] (1974), ''[[Carnival of Souls]]'' (1962) and [[The Shining (film)|''The Shining'']] (1980)—as well as ''[[Vampyr]]'' (1932), ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) and [[Let the Right One In (film)|''Let The Right One In'']] (2008).<ref name="Emp" />

Although the process was challenging and she was forced to reduce their total budget, producer Kristina Ceyton managed to secure funding of around A$2.5 million from government bodies [[Screen Australia]] and the [[South Australian Film Corporation|SAFC]]; however, they still required an additional budget for the construction of the film sets. To attain the funds for the sets, Kent and Causeway Films producer Kristina Ceyton launched a [[Kickstarter]] crowdfunding campaign in June 2012, with a target of US$30,000. Their funding goal was reached on 27 September 2012 through pledges from 259 backers raising $30,071.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jennifer Kent, Kristina Ceyton|title=Realise the vision of The Babadook|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thebabadook/realise-the-vision-of-the-babadook|website=Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter, Inc|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Jennifer Kent, Kristina Ceyton|title=The Babadook – Profile|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/thebabadook|website=Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter, Inc|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=June 2012}}</ref>

===Filming===
The film was primarily shot in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], with most of the interior shots filmed on a soundstage in the Australian city—as the funding was from the South Australian state government, this was a requirement that Kent needed to meet.<ref name="Lui" /> However, Kent explained to the Den of Geek website that she is not patriotic and didn't want the film to be "particularly Australian".

{{quote box|width=35%|quote=I wanted to create a myth in a domestic setting. And even though it happened to be in some strange suburb in Australia somewhere, it could have been anywhere. I guess part of that is creating a world that wasn't particularly Australian ... I'm very happy, actually, that it doesn't feel particularly Australian.|source=Director Jennifer Kent on her desire to avoid the cliched "[[Australian culture|Australian feel]]" of the film<ref name="Den" />}}

To contribute to the universality of the film's appearance, a Victorian terrace-style house was specifically built for the film, as there are very few houses designed in such a style in Adelaide.<ref name="Den" /> A script reading was not done due to Noah Wiseman's age at the time—six years old—and Kent focused on bonding, playing games, and lots of time spent with the actors in which they became more familiar with one another. Pre-production occurred in Adelaide and lasted three weeks and, during this time, Kent conveyed a "kiddie" version of the narrative to Wiseman.<ref name="Alt" />

Kent originally wanted to film solely in black-and-white, as she wanted to create a "heightened feel" that is still believable. She was also influenced by pre-1950s B-grade horror films, as it was "very theatrical", in addition to being "visually beautiful and terrifying". Kent later lost interest in the black-and-white idea and worked closely with production designer Alex Holmes and Radek to create a "very cool", "very claustrophobic" interior environment with "meticulously designed" sets.<ref name="Den" /><ref name="San" /> The film's final colour scheme was achieved without the use of gels on the camera lenses or any alterations during the post-filming stage.<ref name="Paul" /> Kent cited filmmakers [[David Lynch]] and [[Roman Polanski]] as key influences during the filming stage.<ref name="Alt" />

Kent described the filming process as "stressful" because of Wiseman's age. Kent explained "So I really had to be focused. We needed double the time we had." Wiseman's mother was on set and a "very protective, loving environment" was created.<ref name="Den" /> Kent explained after the release of the film that Wiseman was protected throughout the entire project: "During the reverse shots where Amelia was abusing Sam verbally, we had Essie [Davis] yell at an adult stand-in on his knees. I didn't want to destroy a childhood to make this film—that wouldn't be fair."<ref name="Alt" /> Kent's friendship with Davis was a boon during filming and Kent praised her former classmate in the media: "To her credit, she's [Davis] very receptive, likes to be directed and is a joy to work with."<ref name="San" />

In terms of the Babadook monster and the scary effects of the film, Kent was adamant from the outset of production that a low-fi and handmade approach would be used. She cites the influence of [[Georges Méliès]], [[Jean Epstein]]'s [[The Fall of the House of Usher (1928 French film)|''The Fall of the House of Usher'']] and ''[[Häxan]]''.<ref name="Gary">{{cite web|author1=Gary Collinson|title=Interview with Jennifer Kent, director of The Babadoo|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/11/interview-jennifer-kent-director-babadook.html|website=Flickering Myth|publisher=Flickering Myth|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=13 November 2014}}</ref> Kent used stop-motion effects for the monster and a large amount of smoothening was completed in post-production. Kent explained to the ''Empire'' publication: "There's been some criticism of the lo-fi approach of the effects, and that makes me laugh because it was always intentional. I wanted the film to be all in camera."<ref name="Emp">{{cite web|author1=Helen O'Hara|title=The Scariest Film Of The Year?

==Reception==

===Box office===
''The Babadook'' opened in Australia on 22 May 2014 in just 13 cinemas on a [[limited release]], eventually grossing a total of only $258,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/2014/12/03/babadook/|title=Why was 'The Babadook' kept from Australians|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=12 May 2015|work=The New Daily}}</ref> The film fared much better internationally than it did in its native country. In North America, ''The Babadook'' opened on a limited release basis in three theaters and grossed US$30,007, with an average of $10,002 per theater. The film ranked in the 42nd position at the box office, and, as of 1 February 2015, has grossed $950,792 in the U.S. and $6.5 million elsewhere in the world. To date, the film's worldwide box office takings are $7.5 million which compares favourably with the estimated production budget of $2 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Babadook|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&id=babadook.htm|website=Box Office Mojo|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|accessdate=8 February 2015|date=1 February 2015}}</ref> It was subsequently released in [[France]], where it opened at number 11 at the French box office. Its success overseas re-generated interest in Australia, and the film was expanded to mainstream movie-theatres like [[Event Cinemas|Event]], rather than primarily art house cinemas.

===Critical response===
''The Babadook'' was one of the best reviewed films of the year. It holds a "Certified Fresh" score of 98% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 210 reviews with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10. The critical consensus states: "''The Babadook'' relies on real horror rather than cheap jump scares—and boasts a heartfelt, genuinely moving story to boot."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_babadook/ | title=''The Babadook'' | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref> The film also has a score of 86 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 34 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Babadook|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-babadook|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=14 December 2014}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' aggregation, it was ranked as the third most-praised film of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of 2014|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2014|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>

Writing for ''The Daily Beast'', Tim Teeman contends that grief is the "real monster" in ''The Babadook'', and that the film is "about the aftermath of death; how its remnants destroy long after the dead body has been buried or burned". Teeman writes that he was "gripped" by the "metaphorical imperative" of Kent's film, with the Babadook monster representing "the shape of grief: all-enveloping, shape-shifting, black". Teeman states that the film's ending "underscored the thrum of grief and loss at the movie's heart", and concludes that it informs the audience that grief has its place and the best that humans can do is "marshal it".<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tim Teeman|title=Grief: The Real Monster in The Babadook|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/19/grief-the-real-monster-in-the-babadook.html|website=The Daily Beast|publisher=The Daily Beast Company Ltd|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=19 December 2014}}</ref>

Egyptian national film critic Wael Khairy wrote in his "Film Analysis" on 22 November 2014 that ''The Babadook'' "taps into something real, a real human fear".<ref name="Cine">{{cite web|author1=Wael Khairy|title=Film Analysis: "The Babadook"|url=https://cinephilefix.wordpress.com/2014/11/22/film-analysis-the-babadook/|website=The Cinephile Fix|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=22 November 2014}}</ref> Khairy argues that what the Babadook stands for is "up for debate", but writes:

<blockquote>
The malevolent Babadook is basically a physicalised form of the mother's trauma ... I believe, the Babadook embodies the destructive power of grief. Throughout the film, we see the mother insist nobody bring up her husband's name. She basically lives in denial. Amelia has repressed grief for years, refusing to surrender to it.<ref name="Cine" /></blockquote>

Khairy concluded that the film is "based on something very real" and "feels unusually beautiful and even therapeutic."<ref name="Cine" />
