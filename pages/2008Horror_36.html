'''''Chemical Wedding''''' (released in the [[United States|U.S.]] as '''''Crowley'''''<ref name="Fangoria">[http://fangoriaonline.com/home/news/16-dvd-a-blu-ray/883-assorted-horror-dvd-news.html Fangoria Online – Assorted Horror DVD News]</ref>) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Supernatural horror film|supernatural]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Horror film|horror]] film produced by Bill&Ben Productions in conjunction with the London-based [[Focus Films]].

Dickinson released a solo album entitled ''[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]'' in 1998, which, despite sharing the title and title track from the film's soundtrack, is otherwise unrelated.

According to Rockerparis, [[Iron Maiden]] lead singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] was in [[Paris, France]], on 26 November to promote the film's DVD release. The screening and press conference were held in a private cinema in front of [[Europe 1]] radio near the Champs Elysées.<ref>[http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/iron_maiden_singer_to_promote_chemical_wedding_dvd_release.html Iron Maiden Singer To Promote 'Chemical Wedding' DVD Release]</ref> Dickinson, who has a small cameo role in the film, has stated that, "On several levels, I think it will be nice for them ([Iron Maiden fans]) to see somebody from Maiden doing something else that gets the band's name out there and also potentially gets a bit of respect for heavy metal and all the rest of it....But, in addition, I think they'll just enjoy it. It's a rollicking good story."<ref>Beth Hilton, "Iron Maiden star makes Crowley movie", ''Digital Spy'', 31 August 2007</ref>

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=August 2016}}
[[Channel 4]] stated that "The look and feel of ''Chemical Wedding'' is evidently an homage to Hammer and early 1970s Brit horror-fantasy in general: that is to say, cheap. And though aiming to titillate, the execution is so naff it might as well be renamed 'Confessions of a Cabbalist'."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140914005206/http://www.channel4.com/film/reviews/film.jsp?id=166568&section=review Chemical Wedding Review]</ref>

Horror.com praised the film, calling it "a mixed bag of tricks to be sure, but it's worth a look for the curio factor. (At least it's not a remake, a J-horror knock-off, or torture porn.)"<ref>[http://www.horror.com/php/article-2254-1.html Horror.com – Crowley Review]</ref>
