==Plot==
Lisa Johnson, the [[ghost]] of a teenage girl who becomes aware that she is dead, haunts a house somewhere in northern Ontario.  Along with her parents and brother, who are unaware that they are dead, she is stuck on the same day they were murdered in 1985. As she becomes more aware of her circumstances, she realizes that she can make contact with people in other timelines.  As she explores this ability, a pale man appears and warns her to stop. Undeterred, Lisa uses personal items from other people killed in the house to make a connection with Olivia, part of a family living in the house in the future who will become the next set of victims.  

With the help of Olivia and the spirits of other murdered girls, Lisa is transported into the timelines of other victims and unravels the mystery of the house, realizing that the previous resident of the house, Edgar Mullins, is possessing the fathers of the families who live in the house to continue his serial murders.  She causes her family to come to terms with the knowledge that they are dead, and thus "awakened" they become able to assist her. After her family escapes to the afterlife, Lisa stays behind to stop Edgar. She is nearly trapped in Olivia's body as Mullin moves on to kill them, but Lisa is able to escape him long enough to summon the spirits of Mullin's past victims, delaying his next kill long enough for the spirits of his other victims to join her. As Mullin is 'incinerated' in the furnace where he killed his own victims, Olivia's father retakes control of his body, confused about what just happened. After assuring him and Olivia that they will be a happy family again, Lisa goes to sleep, but awakens with her family on her birthday, out of the loop that Mullin trapped them in.
