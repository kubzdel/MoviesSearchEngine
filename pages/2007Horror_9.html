'''''American Zombie''''' is a 2007 American [[mockumentary]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Grace Lee (director)|Grace Lee]], written by Rebecca Sonnenshine and Lee, and starring Lee and John Solomon as documentary filmmakers who investigate a fictional subculture of real-life zombies living in [[Los Angeles]].

== Plot ==
John Solomon, a documentary filmmaker, recruits Grace Lee to investigate the zombie subculture of [[Los Angeles]].  Solomon is convinced that the zombies are dangerous and wishes to expose them, but Lee takes a more sympathetic view.  Zombies are divided into three different categories: the feral, [[George A. Romero|Romero]]-style zombies that exhibit no sentience; low-functioning zombies that can work simple menial jobs, such as sweatshops; and high-functioning zombies that do not retain their memories or personality but can pass as human.  At first open and welcoming, the zombies become evasive and warn the documentary crew away from a private ceremony at an upcoming zombie festival.  There, the crew discovers that the rumors of cannibalism are not simply an ignorant cultural stereotype.
