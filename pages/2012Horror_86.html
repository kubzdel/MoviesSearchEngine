==Plot==
The village of Uljinri has been plagued by evil for decades. When mysterious accidents and events keep happening without avail, shamans from all over the country gather to hold a shaman ritual, and Chan-young, a young newspaper reporter is sent to cover the story.

The group of shamans begins their grand ritual, but with the strange eerie force that dominates the entire village and repeated attacks by the spirits, most of the shamans run for their lives. Only the five best shamans remain: Teacher Park, the most famous "star fortune teller" who gets paid for performing exorcisms around the country; Monk Shim-in, who studied with him under the same master but is now telling sundry couple's fortunes around old Tabgol Park; Suk-hyun who has a doctorate in engineering and makes all kinds of demon-chasing equipment; a boy named Wol-kwang, who has the power to see into the near future; and Seung-hee who is skilled at tarot cards and can see the memories stored in all objects. Along with Chan-young, the six begin to explore the dark secrets of the village while preparing for the biggest battle against the evil forces.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kang|first=Byeong-jin|title=Korea’s most anticipated films of 2012|url=http://koreanfilm.or.kr/webzine/sub/feature.jsp?mode=A_VIEW&wbSeq=49|work=Korea Cinema Today|accessdate=2012-11-18|date=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/adorable-geeks-battle-supernatural-forces-in-sin-jeong-wons-the-fortune-tellers/ |title= Adorable Geeks Battle Supernatural Forces in Sin Jeong-won’s The Fortune Tellers|last=Rigney|first=Todd|accessdate=2012-11-18|date=2 March 2012|work=Beyond Hollywood}}</ref>
