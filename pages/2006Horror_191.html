'''''Stupid Teenagers Must Die!''''' (early title ''Blood & Guts'') is a 2006 spoof film directed by Jeff C. Smith and written by Smith and Curtis Andersen.<ref name="OC">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2008-01-24/film/scared-stupid/|title=January 23, 2008|last=Thompson|first=Luke Y.|date=January 23, 2008|publisher=[[OC Weekly]]|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref><ref name="TCM">{{cite web|url=http://turnerclassic.moviesunlimited.com/product.asp?sku=D98504|title=Stupid Teenagers Must Die!

==Background==

In an early interview with Unbound, director Jeff C. Smith revealed that he and co-producers Sara Parrell and Curtis Andersen, as well as actor Jovan Meredith all at one time worked together in the Entertainment division at [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. Smith shared that it was during their employment at the park, and when the group had collaborated on an earlier project, he learned that Jovan had skills he wished to include in a future project... the one which became ''Stupid Teenagers Must Die''.<ref name="U">{{cite web|url=http://www.unboundzine.com/jeffcsmith.html|title=Interview with Jeff C. Smith|work=director interview|publisher=Unbound|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>  Even before the film had entered post-production, the crew had optimistically scheduled its premiere as ''Blood & Guts'' at [[Cinespace]] in [[Hollywood, California]] for July 13, 2006. However, the film was not ready and director Smith was compelled to screen the incomplete rough-cut he did have, as a "test screening". The audience panned the project. Taking the lesson of premature release to heart, Smith spent the next several months finishing the film's editing in preparation for its subsequent screenings.<ref name="U"/>

==Plot==
A group of teens meets in a haunted house to hold a seance.  The characters include a cool hero guy ([[Jovan Meredith]]), a naive girlfriend ([[Ashley Schneider / Aurora Sta. Maria]]), a goth girl ([[Renee Dorian]]), a tough guy ([[Devin Marble]]), a ditzy blonde girl ([[Lindsay Gareth]]), a shy geek in love with the blonde ([[Matt Blashaw]]), two big nerds ([[Cory Assink]] & [[Jonathan Brett]]), and a pair of lipstick lesbians ([[Jamie Carson]] & [[Christina DeRosa]]).  Strange things begin to occur: [[death]]s, [[nudity]], pitfalls and traps, inane [[dialogue]], and the teens themselves being one-by-one [[stabbed]] and [[sliced]]... with the cool hero working to save the day before every stupid teenager is dead.

==Reception==
Intended by the director to appeal to "movie geeks",<ref name="KR1"/> the film has received mixed response from genre reviewers. Dorkgasm Senior Staff Writer Kenneth Holm felt that with it being a low-budget film, he began his viewing with lowered expectations but opined that he should have lowered them even more. After panning it in his review, he concluded that he would recommend it only as an "exercise for other budding filmmakers to see what missteps to avoid when making their first movie."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dorkgasm.com/node/292|title=Review: Stupid Teenagers Must Die|last=Holm|first=Kenneth|work=Dorkgasm Senior Staff Writer|publisher=Dorkgasm|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Conversely, the reviewer for Dead Lantern found the film to be worth watching and great fun, remarking that he enjoyed the "back story" of why the house was haunted in the first place and feels that it would be a great prequel, and concludes by recommending it as a "comedy that will make even the most jaded horror elitists smile,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadlantern.com/reviews/index.php?review_id=488|title=Movie Review: Stupid Teenagers Must Die!|work=staff review|publisher=Dead Lantern|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and Fatally Yours called it a "film that knows how to have a good time!" in a review that acclaimed the film as "one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films Iâ€™ve seen in quite some time";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatally-yours.com/horror-reviews/stupid-teenagers-must-die/|title=Review of Stupid Teenagers Must Die! |work=film review|publisher=Fatally Yours|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> however, a reviewer for The Movies Made Me Do It, decided that even with touting itself as a low-budget spoof, the filmmakers lost track of the fact that they were making a spoof, resulting in them trying too hard at the wrong goals and taking the film too seriously, when it could have remained funny throughout, leading to them "basically creating a slasher film from the eighties minus the things that made those movies so appealing in the first place: massive body counts, T&A, and a neat villain for the heroes to contend with", concluding that "It's never even remotely scary", and "it's simply not funny either save for a couple of one-liners."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesmademe.com/movie/review/1456|title=Stupid Teenagers Must Die! (2006)|work=review|publisher=The Movies Made Me Do It|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> The film had a major write-up in the October 2007 issue of ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=151040717&blogID=320808754|title=Stupid Teenagers Must Die!|work=scan of [[Fangoria]] writeup provided by director|publisher=[[Fangoria Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>

Three weeks prior to the DVD release, director Smith shared that the distributor allowed them a maximum of 125 minutes on the DVD, so he had chosen to include a 30-minute "making of" documentary titled ''Movies Are Bullshit! The Making Of Stupid Teenagers Must Die!'', with commentary by director Jeff C. Smith and actor Jovan Meredit, an audience reaction track from the premiere, and an interview with cast member Will Deutsch.<ref name="U"/>
