'''''Kill List''''' is a 2011 British [[Crime film|crime drama]] [[Psychological horror|psychological]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Ben Wheatley]], co-written and co-edited with Amy Jump, and starring [[Neil Maskell]], [[MyAnna Buring]] and [[Michael Smiley]].

When a British soldier returns home from [[Kiev]], he joins an old friend as [[Contract killing|contract killers]]. His disturbed past surfaces as he spins out of control during jobs and ominous employers raise the stakes. It was filmed in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]] in England.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

== Plot ==
Jay and Gal are former soldiers who have become [[hitman|hitmen]] since they left the military. While Gal is laid back, Jay is still suffering from an unspecified disastrous mission in [[Kiev]]. Despite the urging of his wife Shel, he has not worked since, and they are running out of money. Shel organises a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, Fiona, a [[human resources]] manager. During the evening, Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile, Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror, and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay accepts the job, and the two meet the shadowy client, who has a list of three people he wants killed. The employer unexpectedly cuts Jay's hand and his own, so that the contract is effectively signed in blood. 

Their first target, a priest, appears to recognise Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list is an archivist who keeps a collection of horrific, sickening videos of an undisclosed nature. He also thanks Jay, who, out of disgust for the videos, tortures and savagely beats him to death with a hammer. Jay insists on chasing down and killing the archivist's associates, and as Gal looks into their files, he finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their Kiev mission. Although they do not recognise it, the file includes the symbol that Fiona carved in Jay's mirror. 

Gal informs Jay that while raiding the safe in the home of the second target, he took enough money to cover the total sum they would receive for the contract. The pair decide to abandon the contract and return home. When his cut hand becomes infected, Jay visits his doctor, only to find that his regular doctor has been replaced by another man who will only give him cryptic advice. Jay and Gal return to their client and offer to find replacements to kill the last name on the list. The client refuses and says that both hitmen and their families will be killed if they do not complete the contract. Shel takes their son Sam to the family's cottage for safekeeping while Jay and Gal go back to work. 

Their final mark is a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] who lives in a [[English country house|mansion]]. While observing the house, the pair witness a strange ceremony in the woods that culminates in [[human sacrifice]]. Jay opens fire with an assault rifle, and the leader of the ceremony presents himself for Jay to execute. The remaining masked cultists chase the hitmen into an underground complex, where Gal is disemboweled, forcing Jay to perform a mercy killing on his friend. Emerging from the tunnels, Jay flees to the family cottage and meets with Shel. When he goes outside, he sees that their car's tyres have been slashed and lit torches have been placed around the nearby field. Jay attempts to locate their attackers, but he is knocked unconscious. Inside the cottage, Shel arms herself and shoots several invaders.

Jay awakens in the field, surrounded by the masked cultists, who strip him and place a mask over his face. He is confronted by his last victim, "The Hunchback", a masked and cloaked person armed with a knife. After a brutal knife fight, Jay triumphs, only to discover that the Hunchback was his wife with Sam strapped to her back. Shel appears to laugh as she dies. The cultists applaud and remove their masks, revealing Fiona, the hitmen's client, and the man from the doctor's office amongst their number. Jay is crowned by the cultists.

== Production ==
After making ''[[Down Terrace]]'', Wheatley wanted to use the lessons learned to make a horror film. The original treatment was a hybrid of the styles and themes of ''[[Get Carter]]'' and [[H. P. Lovecraft]] that was to have been shot in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=timeout/>  Shooting took place over 18 days.<ref name=bloody/>  Wheatley was influenced by [[Stanley Kubrick]] in that he sought to find imagery first, then wove the plot around it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/ben-wheatley-kill-list|title='Kill List' Director Ben Wheatley Talks About 'That' Ending and Why the Film's So Personal|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=3 February 2012|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>  In each scene, they shot one take using the script and then paraphrased and improvised. The actors also worked out back stories for their characters through improvisation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/23858/sxsw-11-interview-kill-list-director-ben-wheatley/|title=SXSW '11: INTERVIEW: 'Kill List' Director Ben Wheatley|last=Harley|first=David|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>  The script was much more explicit in its themes and ideas, but Wheatley edited the film to form a more ambiguous and minimalist story.  By keeping allusions to those scenes, he wanted to give viewers enough information to form their own interpretation.<ref name=complex>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/01/interview-kill-list-writer-director-ben-wheatley/page/view-all|title=Interview: "Kill List" Writer-Director Ben Wheatley Talks Ambiguous Horror, Sickening Audiences & Nightmare Imagery|last=Barone|first=Matt|work=Complex.com|date=9 January 2012|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>  Wheatley dislikes exposition, so he decided to avoid it. Instead, he focused on his own fears: nightmares that he had as a child and domestic disharmony. Themes included suburban desolation, homogeneity, and showing hitmen as violent murderers.<ref name=timeout>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/ben-wheatley-british-cinemas-new-wunderkind-1|title=Ben Wheatley: British cinema's new wunderkind|last=Huddleston|first=Tom|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>  Wheatley also wanted to highlight current events: unpopular wars, a recession, and erosion of the social contract.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/aug/27/kill-list-ben-wheatley|title=Kill List: it's a war film, it's a horror film, it's complicated|last=Wise|first=Damon|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

The film's story came partially from casting ideas, and Wheatley specifically wrote the part of Jay for Neil Maskell, with whom he'd worked previously on a TV series. Wheatley always had a plan for the ending and made sure the story was logically consistent, though he states that there are multiple possible interpretations and the cult itself remains scarier when its motives and background are shrouded in mystery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/832-kill-list-interview-with-director-ben-wheatley|title=Interview: Ben Wheatley, Director of KILL LIST|last=Contario|first=Martyn|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=14 September 2011|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>  Wheatley states that cultists are a popular choice of antagonist because people are uneasy about the world and feel a lack of control and understanding; politicians and bankers who control their lives seem inscrutable.<ref name=bloody>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/26415/interview-tiff-11-kill-list-director-ben-wheatley/|title=[Interview] TIFF '11: 'Kill List' Director Ben Wheatley|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>  The cult's symbol was designed by Wheatley, who later recognised influence from ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. Wheatley was worried people might call him on its similarities, but he was instead surprised to find people comparing it to a symbol from ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', with which he is unfamiliar.<ref name=guardian/>  The film's most violent scene, the hammer murder, came about when Wheatley was surprised at the shocking violence in ''[[The Orphanage (film)|The Orphanage]]'', which he had assumed would be a subtle art-house film.  Wheatley stated that this turn toward violent horror in ''The Orphanage'' made the rest of the film unpredictable; he wanted a similar unpredictability in his own film, so that viewers were never sure whether the film would be subtle or explicit.<ref name=complex/>

The song "It Could Have Been Better", used in the film, is performed by [[Joan Armatrading]]. It was written by Armatrading and [[Pam Nestor]] and is from the 1972 album ''[[Whatever's for Us]]''.<ref>http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/kill-list/ retrieved 15h February 2014</ref>

== Reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 77% of 87 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 7.1/10; the consensus is: "''Kill List'' is an expertly executed slow-burn crime thriller that thrives on tension before morphing into visceral horror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/kill_list_2011/|title=Kill List|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized score, rated the film 67/100 based on 22 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/kill-list|title=Kill List|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=28 December 2013}}</ref>

''[[Total Film]]'' rated the film 5/5 stars and said that as well as being a horror film it was "also a [[Mystery film|mystery movie]], a [[road movie]] and a grotesque riff on [[Arthurian legend]], and is influenced as much by [[John Cassavetes]], [[Alan Clarke]] and [[Ken Loach]] as ''[[Witchfinder General (film)|Witchfinder General]]'', ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' and ''[[Blood on Satan's Claw|The Blood On Satan's Claw]]''" before concluding that "[a]uthentic dialogue, pitch-perfect performances and seductively scuzzy images comprise a film funny and bleak, tender and cruel, serious and 'out-there'.

''Kill List'' also received positive reviews in America.
