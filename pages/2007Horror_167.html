'''''The Orphanage''''' ({{lang-es|link=no|'''El Orfanato'''}}) is a 2007 Spanish [[horror film]] and the debut feature of Spanish filmmaker [[J. A. Bayona]]. The film stars [[Belén Rueda]] as Laura, Fernando Cayo as her husband, Carlos, and Roger Príncep as their adopted son Simón. The plot centers on Laura, who returns to her childhood home, an orphanage. Laura plans to turn the house into a home for disabled children, but after an argument with Laura, Simón goes missing.

The film's script was written by [[Sergio G. Sánchez]] in 1996 and brought to the attention of Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, director [[Guillermo del Toro]], to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. Bayona wanted the film to capture the feel of 1970s [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish cinema]]; he cast [[Geraldine Chaplin]] and [[Belén Rueda]], who were later praised for their roles in the film.

The film opened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 20, 2007, where it received a standing ovation lasting more than 10 minutes. It received critical acclaim from audiences in its native Spain, winning seven [[Goya awards]]. On its North American release, ''The Orphanage'' was praised by English-speaking critics, who described  the film as well directed and well acted, and noted the film's lack of "cheap scares"; subsequently, [[New Line Cinema]] bought the rights to the film for an American [[remake]].

==Plot==
<!-- Please help keep this section brief. Every detail of the plot does not need to appear here. -->
In 1975 Spain, a young girl named Laura is adopted. Years later, adult Laura ([[Belén Rueda]]) returns to the closed [[orphanage]], accompanied by her husband, Carlos (Fernando Cayo), and their seven-year-old son, Simón (Roger Príncep). She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo ([[Montserrat Carulla]]) visits the house to inquire after Simón, and the audience learn that Laura and Carlos adopted Simón and that he is [[HIV-positive people|HIV positive]]. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. Later that night Laura finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Simón's adoption file. Simón becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon.

During a party for the orphanage's opening, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from her. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. When Laura escapes, she realizes that Simón is missing and is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes within the walls of the orphanage. Police psychologist Pilar ([[Mabel Rivera]]) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón.

Six months later, Simón is still missing. While searching for him, Laura spots Benigna, who is then struck and killed by a bus. The police find evidence that Benigna worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named Tomás, who lived there but was kept hidden. A few weeks after Laura was adopted, the orphans stole the mask that Tomás wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, Tomás refused to leave his hiding place in a nearby sea cave, and the rising tide drowned him.

Laura asks for the assistance of a [[Mediumship|medium]] named Aurora ([[Geraldine Chaplin]]) in the search for Simón. Aurora conducts a [[seance]] during which she claims to see the [[ghost]]s of the orphans crying for help. Laura discovers the remains of the orphans she grew up with in the orphanage. Benigna poisoned their meals and killed them for having caused Tomás's death and hid their remains in the orphanage's coal shed.<ref name="UKinterview" /> <!-- this is cited to note that it's not a furnace as once written. In the interview with the director he says it's a coal shed --> Unable to cope with the situation, Carlos leaves the orphanage.

Laura makes the orphanage look as it did thirty years ago and attempts to contact the children's spirits by playing one of their old games. The spirits lead her to the door of a hidden underground room. Inside is Simón's corpse, wearing Tomás's mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.

Laura takes an overdose of sleeping pills. Dying, she begs to be with Simón again and the children's spirits appear, with Simón among them. Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay and take care of the orphans, she then happily tells them a story. Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.<!-- Do not add the speculation that the ghost of Laura is present when the door opens, as it is not explicitly shown in the film. -->

===Development===
The first draft of the script of ''The Orphanage'' was written by [[Sergio G.

===Casting===
During casting discussions between Bayona and del Toro, Bayona expressed a desire to see [[Belén Rueda]] in the lead.<ref name="official_aboutproduction"/> Bayona admired her after seeing her performance as Julia in [[Alejandro Amenabar]]'s ''[[The Sea Inside]]''.<ref name="futuremovies">{{cite web |url=http://www.futuremovies.co.uk/filmmaking.asp?ID=241 |title=The Orphanage Q&A with director Juan Antonio Bayona |accessdate=2008-10-28 |publisher=FutureMovies|date=13 March 2008}}</ref> Del Toro appreciated this choice, as he admired her as an actress and liked that Bayona was casting her against type.<ref name="official_aboutproduction"/> Bayona asked Rueda to watch ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' to prepare for the role.<ref name="interviewDeadbolt3">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/102983/belenrueda_interview.php |title=Deadbolt Interview |accessdate=2008-10-28 |author=Brian Tallerico |publisher=The Dead Bolt |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081120124340/http://www.thedeadbolt.com/news/102983/belenrueda_interview.php <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=20 November 2008}}</ref> Another actress Bayona desired for the film was [[Geraldine Chaplin]] in the role of Aurora, the medium.<ref name="official_aboutproduction"/> Bayona stated that he wanted the film to have "the mood of 70s [[Cinema of Spain|Spanish cinema]] and Geraldine starred in one of the best movies of that decade, [[Carlos Saura]]'s ''[[Cría cuervos|The Secret of Anna]]'', as the ghost of the mother. It made sense to have her play the medium."<ref name="futuremovies" /> Bayona was nervous about filming with Chaplin. To break that tension, on the first day of shooting with her Bayona hid under a bed during a scene which required Chaplin to portray Aurora kneeling down near it in the dark, and he grabbed Chaplin's leg when she did so.<ref name="futuremovies" /> Aurora's scream in the film is Chaplin's actual frightened scream as Bayona grabbed her.<ref name="futuremovies" /> Roger Príncep's test-screening was one of the first for the role of Simón.<ref name="aintitcool">{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34414 |title=Quint interviews Juan Antonio Bayona and Sergio Sanchez about the nifty horror flick The Orphanage |accessdate=2008-10-28 |publisher=Aintitcoolnews|date=12 October 2007}}</ref> Bayona test-screened over four-hundred children during two months before making his choice to cast Princep.<ref name="aintitcool" /> [[Edgar Vivar]] was cast in role of Balabán; Bayona knew him through his work on the Mexican television series ''[[El Chavo (TV series)|El Chavo]]'' and sent him an invitation for the role through e-mail.<ref>{{cite web

===Filming===
Production on ''The Orphanage'' began on May 15, 2006 in [[Llanes]], [[Asturias]].<ref name="official_aboutproduction" /> This location was chosen due to the area's diverse natural settings that include beaches, caves, cliffs, forests, a small village, and the Partarríu Manor where the orphanage scenes take place.<ref name="official_aboutproduction" /> The orphanage was an old [[Spanish Colonial architecture|colonial house]] from the end of the nineteenth century.<ref name="official_aboutproduction" /> Bayona wanted to use certain [[Cinematography|cinematographic]] techniques that were impossible to achieve in the house, so several parts of the house were reconstructed in [[sound stages]].<ref name="official_aboutproduction" /> After four weeks in Llanes, the team moved to [[Barcelona]] to finish up the last ten weeks of filming in sound stages, making over 80% of the film there.<ref name="official_aboutproduction" /> Bayona showed the films ''[[La residencia]]'' and ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' to his [[cinematographer|director of photography]] on the film, to make special notice of the Scope lensing used in both films.<ref name="UKinterview">{{cite web

On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro stated that the remake would reflect his original vision for the film, and that it had been planned even when the first version was in production. "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." Del Toro also praised the new film's director. "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'' and his video work – and we are out to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.ie/movies/news/a333542/guillermo-del-toro-orphanage-remake-will-be-different.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Uddin, Zakia|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=February 27, 2012|title=Guillermo del Toro: 'Orphanage remake will be different'}}</ref> On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress [[Amy Adams]] was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film.

The critical consensus reads, "Deeply unnerving and surprisingly poignant, ''The Orphanage'' is an atmospheric, beautifully crafted haunted house horror film that earns scares with a minimum of blood."<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_orphanage |title=The Orphanage (2007) | accessdate=March 19, 2018 |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media]]}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], the film has received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 74 out of 100, based on 33 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-orphanage | title=The Orphanage Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=March 19, 2018}}</ref>

Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' [[Roger Ebert]] approved of the film claiming it to be "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, a sense of place, a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills".<ref name="ebert">{{cite news |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-orphanage-2007 |title=The Orphanage |accessdate=March 19, 2018 |date=December 27, 2007 |authorlink=Roger Ebert |last=Ebert |first=Roger |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC}}</ref> Bill Goodykoontz of the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' echoed this statement noting, "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed in the context of Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)."<ref name="arizona">{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/2008/01/10/20080110orphanage0111.html |title=''The Orphanage''  |accessdate=2008-11-03 |last=Goodykoontz |first=Bill |work=[[Arizona Republic]] |date=January 10, 2008}}</ref> Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' wrote, "The year's best horror picture is also one of the simplest.

Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not."<ref name="philips">{{cite web |url=http://chicago.metromix.com/movies/movie_review/movie-review-the-orphanage/271213/content |title=Movie review: ''The Orphanage''  |accessdate=2008-11-03 |last=Phillips |first=Michael |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 28, 2007}}</ref> Liam Lacey of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' praised Rueda stating, "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda."<ref name="globemail"/>

A negative review came from Lacey of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', who felt that at "[the film's] core, it seems intended as a sympathetic drama of a bereaved mother, who may have slipped into madness. What's even more disquieting is the persistent undercurrent of exploitation – the mixture of grief and jarring shock effects and the pitiless use of a disfigured child as a source of horror."<ref name="globemail">{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/ghost-story-exploits-but-doesnt-scare/article726926/ |title=Ghost story exploits, but doesn't scare |accessdate=2008-11-03 |last=Lacey |first=Liam |work=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=December 26, 2007}}</ref> [[A.O.
