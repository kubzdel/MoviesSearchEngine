'''''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans''''' is a 2009 American [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Patrick Tatopoulos]]. It is the third installment in the [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 2003 film ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]''. The film focuses primarily on the origins of the characters and the events that lead up to the Vampireâ€“[[Werewolf|Lycan]] war.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of [[Underworld (film series)#Lucian|Lucian]], the first werewolf born capable of taking human form and the first to be called a ''Lycan''. [[Underworld (film series)#Viktor|Viktor]], a vampire elder, raises the child, envisioning a race of Lycan slaves guarding the coven's fortress during the day and working as laborers for the vampires at night. The forests and the countryside are filled with savage werewolves born from [[Underworld (film series)#William|William]]'s rampage, and human nobles have taken to begging Viktor for protection against the beasts: he grants it in exchange for tributes of silver, which enables him to keep his slaves under control. As Lucian grows up, he and Viktor's daughter [[Underworld (film series)#Sonja|Sonja]] ([[Rhona Mitra]]) fall in love, and in their adult years they begin a secretive intimate relationship. Sonja is reckless and insubordinate, and one night Lucian escapes the shackles preventing him from turning werewolf and rescues Sonja from his werewolf brethren. Despite acknowledging that Lucian rescued his daughter, Viktor cannot forgive the escape and has Lucian whipped and imprisoned.

By trading her seat on the vampire council, Sonja enlists the help of [[Underworld (film series)#Andreas Tanis|Andreas Tanis]] in orchestrating Lucian's release. Lucian, unable to flee alone, liberates the other Lycans as he escapes. Sonja remains, planning to meet Lucian in three days. As she prepares to leave she is visited by her father. Viktor asks if she assisted in Lucian's escape: she denies it, but he discovers the truth by biting her neck and reading her memories through her blood. Discovering her relationship with Lucian, he imprisons her. Meanwhile, in the forest, Lucian recruits both human slaves and werewolves to build a force against the vampires. In the fortress, the vampire council and nobles demand that Viktor recapture Lucian, as his Lycans have been attacking human estates, freeing their slaves and offering them immortality as Lycans themselves. Viktor replies that he is confident Lucian will return as he has something Lucian wants: Sonja.

Lucian learns about Sonja's imprisonment and eventually rescues her from her room but they are stopped from escaping by Viktor. Sonja, hoping to spare Lucian's life, reveals to Viktor that she is pregnant with Lucian's child. Disgusted, Viktor overpowers her and imprisons both her and Lucian. Sonja is unanimously sentenced to death by the council at a trial presided over by her father, and is executed by exposure to sunlight in Lucian's presence. Viktor later visits her body and retrieves her pendant.<!-- Do not mention that Lucian retrieved Sonja's pendant, in order to enhance readers' understanding of the "Plot" section of Underworld: Evolution's Wikipedia article as, according to the guidelines, Wikipedia articles are written independently of each other. -->

Lucian turns werewolf, but his attempt to escape the fortress is thwarted by the Death Dealers. He is able to communicate with and control the wild werewolves, however, and summons them to storm the fortress. A melee ensues in which vampire council members, their aides and lesser vampire nobles are killed. Realizing that Viktor intends to flee, Lucian pursues him and they fight. Lucian traps Viktor by exposing him to shafts of sunlight and then stabs him through the mouth with a sword and pushes his body down into a nearby body of water. With the battle over, Lucian's deputy Raze declares that "it is finished", but Lucian knows this victory is only the beginning of what will become a war between the races.

The film's [[Post-credits scene|coda]] reveals Viktor, having survived his wound, on a vampire ship fleeing the fortress and being sealed in an elder hibernation chamber by Tanis. The opening scene of the first ''Underworld'' film is also shown, with the voice of vampire [[Underworld (film series)#Kraven|Kraven]] ([[Shane Brolly]]) revealing to [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) that it was Viktor who had killed her family, not the Lycans, and that he had spared her life because she reminded him of his executed daughter Sonja; Selene, unaware of the truth, dismisses Kraven's statement as "lies".

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
In September 2003, shortly after the release of ''Underworld'', production companies [[Screen Gems]] and Lakeshore planned to release a prequel as the third film following ''Underworld''{{'}}s sequel, ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'' (2006). [[Kate Beckinsale]], who portrayed [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] in ''Underworld'', expressed interest in reprising her role for the sequel and the prequel.<ref name="teeth">{{cite news | first=Dana | last=Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117892967.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 | title=Scribe Duo Sinks Teeth into Sequels | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2003-09-24 | accessdate=2006-10-30 }}</ref>

In December 2005, ''Underworld: Evolution'' director [[Len Wiseman]] explained that the ''Underworld'' franchise was originally conceived as a trilogy. Wiseman said, "We sort of mapped out an entire history and story... a massive collection of ideas and stories that we're putting out at certain times." Wiseman anticipated creating a third installment for the franchise based on the audience's reception of ''Underworld: Evolution'', which would be released the following month.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue451/news.html | title=Wiseman Looking To ''Underworld 3'' | publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] | date=2005-12-12 | accessdate=2006-10-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017041806/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue451/news.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-17}}</ref>

In a June 2006 interview, Wiseman said, "The third film is going to be a prequel. It will be the origin story and we find out things we didn't know about Lucian; he'll have a much bigger part in it. It will be about the creation [of the races] and what started the war. It will be a period piece. The movie will also focus for the first time through the Lycans' point of view." The director also shared, "In terms of the writing, a lot of the writing has been done. We've been developing ''Underworld 3'' for a while. I won't be directing ''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans''; I'm just going to be producing and writing." When asked if Kate Beckinsale would reprise her role as Selene in the prequel, Wiseman said, "It will be in the time period before, but it will overlap into the creation of her as well. We're in the process of seeing how far we go with that."<ref name="if">{{cite news | first=Sean | last=Elliott | url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=3038 | title=Exclusive Interview: Underworld Director Len Wiseman Talks Die Hard 4 & Underworld 3 | publisher=iFMagazine.com | date=2006-06-06 | accessdate=2006-10-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061024005330/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=3038 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-24}}</ref> The following October, actor Michael Sheen, who portrays Lucian in the film series, expressed interest in being part of the prequel.<ref>{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/indietopnews.php?id=17065 | title=Exclusive: Michael Sheen of ''The Queen'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=2006-10-20 | accessdate=2007-07-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512205039/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/indietopnews.php?id=17065 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-12}}</ref>

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that the film would be written by Danny McBride and mark the directorial dÃ©but of [[Patrick Tatopoulos]], who designed the creature effects for all three ''Underworld'' films. Len Wiseman would produce, and contribute to the writing of this film, but would not direct, nor would Kate Beckinsale reprise her lead role of Selene nor would [[Scott Speedman]] reprise his role of [[Michael Corvin]]. In late September 2007, ''[[Outlander (film)|Outlander]]'' screenwriters Dirk Blackman and Howard McCain were brought on board and delivered a draft on November 3, mere days before the [[2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike|2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref>{{cite web|title=IMDB|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0834001/}}</ref> Pre-production began shortly thereafter.

The film was shot in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. There was some additional shooting in [[Roxboro, North Carolina]], and there is a brief pickup shot of [[Tenaya Lake]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] as well.

===Critical reception===
The film received mostly mixed reviews.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/underworld3 |title=Underworld: Rise of the Lycans |accessdate=4 February 2009 |work=Metacritic}}</ref> According to the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], as of January 2012, 29% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 76 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Despite the best efforts of its competent cast, ''Underworld: Rise of the Lycans'' is an indistinguishable and unnecessary prequel."<ref name="RottenTomatoes">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/underworld_rise_of_the_lycans/ |title=Underworld: Rise of the Lycans |accessdate=17 February 2009 |work=Rotten Tomatoes}}</ref> Most of the acclaim is attributed to Michael Sheen's performance. At the website [[Metacritic]] the film has received an average score of 44, based on 14 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic"/> [[Joe Leydon]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review, stating that director Patrick Tatopoulos "offers a satisfyingly exciting monster rally that often plays like a period swashbuckler" and that the film is "notably less frenetic (and appreciably more coherent) than its predecessors".<ref name="Variety-2009jan23">{{cite news |first=Joe |last=Leydon |authorlink=Joe Leydon |title=Underworld: Rise of the Lycans |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117939445.html |work=Variety |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> He also praised the lead actors for their performances. Leydon described Rhona Mitra's performance as "more than adequate" but says that "her Sonja never achieves the pop-icon impact of [[Kate Beckinsale|Beckinsale]]'s Selene"; he felt that Michael Sheen "hits all the right notes in a star-powered performance that will amuse, if not amaze, anyone who only knows the actor as Tony Blair or David Frost", and that Bill Nighy "offers a sly and stylish turn as Viktor".<ref name="Variety-2009jan23"/> Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' stated that the film "rises to the occasion" and that it "finds more life left than would be expected in the darkly stylized if dramatically flawed vampires vs. werewolves saga."<ref name="THR-2009jan25">{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Rechtshaffen |title=Film Review: Underworld: Rise of the Lycans |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-underworld-rise-of-the-lycans-1003934181.story |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129111956/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-underworld-rise-of-the-lycans-1003934181.story? |archivedate=January 29, 2009 }}</ref> He credited this to the "sturdy performances" of Sheen and Nighy and the "tidy, unfussy direction" by Tatopoulos.<ref name="THR-2009jan25"/> Also giving the film a positive review was Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'', who thought that the film was "surprisingly campy fun, mostly succeeding through the power of its lead performances".<ref name="USAT-2009jan26">{{cite news |first=Claudia |last=Puig |title=Campy 'Underworld' prequel shines a light on Lycans' rise |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2009-01-26-underworld-rise-of-the-lycans_N.htm |work=USA Today |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009}}</ref>

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''The New York Times'' commented that the film "offers few surprises other than Mr. Sheen's vigorous, physical performance", articulating that Sheen is "the movie's greatest asset" and that his commitment to his role demonstrated that there is "some benefit to having a real performance even in a formulaic entertainment like this".<ref name="TNYT-2009jan24">{{cite news |first=Manohla |last=Dargis |authorlink=Manohla Dargis |title=Clash of the Monsters: The Origins of a Feud |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/movies/24unde.html?ref=movies |work=The New York Times |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+ grade, describing the film as "basically Were-[[Spartacus]], though that makes the humorless, scare-free result sound much more fun than it is".
