==Plot==
{{Plot|date=October 2016}}
The Eden Wildlife Zoo, a zoo containing endangered animals, is having its intern orientation day, where college students applying for jobs as interns are touring the zoo. Meanwhile, some the zoo's monkeys contract an unknown disease, and are taken to the clinic where the veterinarians use intracardiac epinephrine, a forbidden serum, in order to save the life of a monkey that suffered a [[cardiac arrest]]. The contagious pathogen spreads to all of the monkeys in the room, turning them into zombies with a predatory behavior towards humans. They attack the veterinarians, and kill two of them, although one manages to activate an alarm.

As the college students arrive, the alarm reaches the zoo's security. One of the security team members, Johnny, decides to check on the veterinarians himself. However, when he doesn't return, the security team, accompanied by college student Gage, make their way to the clinic. Once there, they discover Johnny, and two of the veterinarians are dead. The remaining veterinarian, Dr. Gordon, is barely alive. The monkeys violently confront the group, killing two of the guards. Gage, head of security Rex, and newly hired Lizzy Hogan manage to escape. Ellen Rogers, the manager of the zoo, gets word of the mayhem, and puts the zoo on lockdown. The disease spreads throughout the zoo, infecting a group of wild hogs that attack three of the students. Lizzy, Gage, and Rex arrive just as the students are attacked by infected giraffes, which kill two of the students. They manage to rescue the remaining student, Amber, although Gage is injured in the process. As Lizzy, and Rex tend to Gage's wounds, Amber steals Rex's jeep. Lizzy, Gage, and Rex are forced to use a group of non-infected elephants as transportation.

A police team arrives to eliminate the threat, although they're killed by a group of infected lions. Amber, meanwhile, reaches the front gate, and demands that Ellen, who is watching over the security cameras, open it, although she's attacked by an infected [[gray wolf]]. Ellen's daughter Thea is then attacked by an infected [[koala]], although she kills it with a baseball bat. Ellen inspects the koala's blood, and finds that the disease was created by an unknown enzyme found in the koala's cerebral cortex. She encourages birdkeeper Chelsea to release the birds to prevent them from being infected, although to no avail. Meanwhile, Lizzy, Gage, and Rex are attacked by a group of infected [[Lemur|lemurs]], and Rex is injured. One of the workers, Daxton, and his intern A.J., manage to fend off the zombies, and the group takes refuge inside of the gorilla lab. Daxton goes to check on the zoo's endangered [[Cross River gorilla]], Kifo, although finds him to be infected, and Kifo kills him. Kifo then invades the lab. Rex stabs him, although Kifo decapitates Rex in retaliation.

Lizzy, Gage, and A.J. escape, and encounter a jeep with a feeble, and dying Amber driving. Amber soon dies, although the group is attacked by a group of infected lions as they remove her corpse. They manage to kill the lions, although they crash the jeep in the process. They then attempt to reach the watch tower by using an unfinished zipline, although A.J. falls to his death in the process. The group reunites with Ellen, and Thea, and they theorize that the birds have become infected. They decide to set the aviary on fire using a series of gas cans, although before they do so, Lizzy, and Gage go inside to rescue Chelsea, and her intern Ricky. However, they soon find that they've both been killed by the infected birds, and escape. Ellen sets the aviary on fire, and they set off an additional explosion using Ellen's truck, killing the birds. Kifo then appears, and chases the group to the gate where Ellen seemingly shoots him to death. The four are then rescued by a helicopter. However, after they're rescued, Kifo regains consciousness, revealing he was simply wounded.
