'''''Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy''''' (also known as '''''Mil Mascaras: Resurrection''''') is a 2007 Mexican-American [[lucha libre]] film starring the legendary Mexican wrestler and cult film star [[Mil Máscaras]]. It has the distinction of being the first [[lucha film]] starring any of the "Big 3" ([[El Santo|Santo]], [[Blue Demon]], Mil Máscaras) to be produced in English.<ref name="AboutFilm">{{cite web|url=http://www.mmvsam.com/about.shtml|title=AboutFilm}}</ref> It was a tribute to the 1960s Mexican horror and lucha libre films and was the first of a trilogy of Mil Mascaras films that includes [[Academy of Doom]] (2008) and [[Aztec Revenge]] (2015).

==Plot==
An [[Aztec mummy]] is resurrected in a ceremony in which the blood of a human sacrifice is dripped onto the mummified remains.  The mummy possesses a scepter with a jewel that can be used to control people’s minds for purposes of world conquest. Mil Máscaras learns of the mummy’s plans and is determined to thwart him.

When the scepter fails to do so, the mummy attempts to control Mil's mind by exploiting the hallucinogenic effects of Aztec magic mushrooms and the allure of identical twin seductresses. Mil tracks the mummy to an abandoned monastery but is captured. After escaping with the help of the Professor, Mil is joined by a team of luchadores in a battle against the mummy's warriors. Mil eventually defeats the mummy and entombs him forever.
