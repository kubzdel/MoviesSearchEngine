'''''Santa's Slay''''' is a 2005 [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] Christmas [[black comedy]] [[horror film]] that stars professional [[wrestler]] [[Bill Goldberg]] as [[Santa Claus]]. The movie was written and directed by [[David Steiman]], a former assistant to [[Brett Ratner]].

It was shot in [[Edmonton]] and [[Wetaskiwin]], [[Alberta]].  The film was released to home media by [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]].
While filming the final [[zamboni machine|zamboni]] scene in [[Bruderheim]], [[Alberta]], one of their film trailers caught fire.

==Plot summary==
On [[Christmas Eve]], the Masons, a wealthy yet dysfunctional family, are sitting down to Christmas dinner when Santa Claus ([[Bill Goldberg]]) comes down the chimney and kills them all in a variety of ways. The cast for the opening scene includes [[Cameo appearance|bit roles]] by several famous [[Jews|Jewish]] actors.

Riding on his sleigh driven by his "hell-deer", Santa arrives at Hell Township and decimates the locals in various holiday-themed ways. In one of his kills, Santa slaughters the occupants of a local [[strip club]], frequented by Pastor Timmons ([[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]), a crooked minister, who manages to survive the massacre.  Later, Santa murders the local Jewish [[delicatessen]] owner Mr. Green, ([[Saul Rubinek]]), using his own [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]].

Meanwhile, teenager Nicholas Yuleson ([[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]]) is living with his crazy grandfather ([[Robert Culp]]), a crackpot inventor who has built a [[bunker]] in their basement to survive Christmas. When Nicholas asks Grandpa why he hates Christmas, he is shown "The Book of [[Nicholas of Flüe|Klaus]]", which reveals the origins of Santa Claus.  Apparently, Santa was the result of a [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] produced by [[Satan]] (just as Jesus was the result of a virgin birth produced by God--meaning that Santa is somewhat of an [[Antichrist]]). Christmas was "The Day of Slaying" for Santa until [[Anno domini|A.D.]] 1005, when an angel defeated him in a [[curling]] match and sentenced him to deliver presents on Christmas for 1000 years.  This means that Santa is free to kill again in 2005.

Upon arriving at the delicatessen, Nicholas is taken to the police station for questioning about Mr. Green's murder. He is bailed out by his girlfriend Mary "Mac" Mackenzie ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), just before Santa arrives and kills all of the officers.  Santa pursues Nicholas and Mac in a police car, but they are able to escape, thanks to a shotgun left in Mac's truck by her gun-crazed father (Jeff Hanna). They flee to Mr. Yuleson's bunker, with Santa still in pursuit. Nicholas and Mac manage to escape, care of Grandpa's [[snowmobile]]; but Grandpa is run over by Santa's "hell-deer" and killed.

The two teens hide in a local high school, hoping that Santa's powers will end once Christmas ends; but they are eventually forced to confront him in the [[gymnasium (school)|gym]].  They are almost killed by Santa on a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] but are saved by Grandpa, who is actually the angel who originally defeated and sentenced Santa. With Christmas over and his powers gone, Santa flees in his sleigh; but his "hell-deer" are shot down by Mac's father with a [[bazooka]].  Pastor Timmons is found dead in a Santa suit and is presumed to be the killer, while, in fact, the real killer Santa Claus is boarding a flight from [[Winnipeg]] to the [[North Pole]].

After the credits, Santa is seen looking over his Naughty List, when he looks into the camera and says "[[Bill Goldberg|Who's Next?]]"
