'''''White Noise: The Light''''', also marketed as '''''White Noise 2''''', is a 2007 [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror thriller]] film, directed by [[Patrick Lussier]] and written by Matt Venne. The sequel stars [[Nathan Fillion]] and [[Katee Sackhoff]] in the lead roles. It is a [[Sequel#Stand-alone sequels|stand-alone sequel]] to the 2005 film ''[[White Noise (film)|White Noise]]'', directed by [[Geoffrey Sax]]. The film received positive reviews, but was not commercially successful, and failed to recoup its $10 million budget.

==Plot==
After witnessing the murder of his wife and young son at the hands of Henry Caine ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), who then turned the gun on himself, Abe Dale ([[Nathan Fillion]]) is so distressed that he attempts to take his own life.  A [[near-death experience]] follows that leaves Abe with the ability to identify those who are about to die.  He acts on these [[premonition]]s to save three people from death, among them a nurse met during his recovery, Sherry Clarke ([[Katee Sackhoff]]).

Abe soon learns that Henry, before murdering Abe's wife and son, actually saved their lives.  Abe concludes that Henry also had the ability to see death.  Wanting to learn more about Henry, Abe visits his house only to learn that Henry survived his suicide.  Investigating further, Abe discovers the phenomenon of "Tria Mera", The Third Day, when Christ was resurrected.  Also on the third day the devil takes possession of the mortals who cheated death.  Abe concludes that three days after he saved their lives, those he saved will be [[demonic possession|possessed]] and compelled to take the lives of others.  Accepting this responsibility, Abe comes to terms with the horrible fact that he must consider killing those he had saved to prevent further tragedy.

Abe tries unsuccessfully to prevent the second man he saved from killing others, but arrives just a minute too late. Abe is able however to take the gun from the man before he kills himself. Abe tries to explain the situation to Sherry but she is at first non-receptive and he must follow her to the cafe where his wife and son were murdered. While driving he sees his own aura in the rear view mirror. This time, 
Sherry listens but, just as Abe brings up the gun, police who are already in the cafe shoot him dead. Abe spends his last minutes trying to 
convince Sherry she must kill herself before her own possession is complete. However, as she reaches for the gun the police pick it up and 
she becomes hysterical and is put into an ambulance.

As the ambulance leaves, Sherry struggles against the demons inside her. Back at the cafe, Abe's life force leaves his body as a lightning 
streak in pursuit of Sherry's ambulance vaulting from one utility post to the next. He reaches the ambulance and appears to Sherry as a 
spectre of himself. He is able to comfort her before the demons possess her.  She acknowledges him and expires peacefully after he places 
his hand over her heart.  Up ahead, the speeding ambulance is unaware of an accident blocking its path. An 18-wheel fuel tanker is disabled 
and a commuter bus is stopped. Abe, still manifested as a ghostly spirit, appears on the street directly in front of the ambulance, causing 
the driver to swerve, avoid the accident at the last minute and miss the tanker; thus, saving the people on the bus. Abe's mission 
completed, he finally sees a bright white light in front of him with his family waiting in the distance and is able to move on. Back at 
Blackmount County Asylum, Henry is tormented and driven further insane by the restless spirits of all the victims who died at the hands of 
people he saved.
