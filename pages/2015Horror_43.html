==Synopsis==
Fern is a high school student with a problem. her ex-boyfriend Robert returned from the grave as a ghost. Their relationship wasn't entirely a happy one, since Robert was clingy and smothered her, which led to their breakup. Initially, Fren tried to make things work, but quickly determines that a relationship between a ghost and a living person would not be successful, especially as she has begun to spend time with Harlan, a football player. After Robert subjects her and others to a series of supernatural attacks, Fern turns to her track coach Valeria, who doubles as a ghost hunter. Valeria gives her a series of tools that could help her get rid of Robert's ghost, which includes pills that give her the ability to see ghosts. Fern is finally forced to tell Robert that she doesn't think that the two of them can be together since she's of the living, only for Robert to then change his tactics. Instead of trying to romance her, Robert has decided that the only way they can be together is to kill Fern so that their ghosts can be together. He enlists several other ghosts to help in his efforts, making it necessary for Fern to bring her family and Valeria into the fight. Eventually, Fern and Robert have a face off, during which she manages to convince him to let her go, causing him and the other ghosts to vanish. The film ends with Harlan asking Fern out on a date, to which she replies that she'd like to be single for a while before starting to date again.
