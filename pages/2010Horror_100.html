'''''Let Me In''''' is a 2010 American-British [[Romance film|romantic]] [[horror film]]<ref>{{cite news | date = March 9, 2010 | author = Olsen, Mark | url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/09/entertainment/la-ca-letmein-20100509 |publisher= | work = Los Angeles Times |title= Matt Reeves to genre fans: 'Let Me In' |accessdate = April 4, 2011}}</ref> written and directed by [[Matt Reeves]] and starring [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]], [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], [[Elias Koteas]], and [[Richard Jenkins]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 2008 Swedish film ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=66529|title=American Film Institute: Let Me In}}</ref> The film tells the story of a [[School bullying|bullied]] 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a female child [[vampire]] in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] in the early 1980s.

Interest in producing an English-language version of ''Let the Right One In'' began in 2007 shortly before it was released to audiences. In 2008, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered [[Tomas Alfredson]], the director of the Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from [[Stockholm]] to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.

''Let Me In'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010, and was released in North America on October 1, 2010. The film was placed on several critics' top-ten list. Many critics noted it as a rare Hollywood remake which stayed true to the original, while others criticized it for being too derivative of the Swedish film. The film earned {{Nowrap|$24 million}} in box office revenue worldwide, of which {{Nowrap|$12 million}} was earned in the United States and Canada. Moretz won several awards for her performance with critics praising the on-screen chemistry with her co-star, Smit-McPhee. ''Let Me In'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in North America on February 1, 2011, and in the UK on March 14, 2011. An official [[comic book]] [[miniseries]] [[prequel]] titled ''Let Me In: Crossroads'' was released after the film which establishes the back-story of Abby and ends where the theatrical film begins.

==Plot==
In March 1983, in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a disfigured man is taken to the hospital. An unnamed police detective tries to question him about a recent murder. While the detective answers a call outside the room, the disfigured man jumps out of the window, leaving behind a note that reads "I'm sorry Abby."

Two weeks earlier, Owen, an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his [[Divorce|divorcing]] parents, sees a young girl, Abby, and an older man moving in next door. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by [[Morse code]] through the walls of their apartments. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny and two of his friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him.

Abby's companion, Thomas, abducts a local teenager and drains his blood into a jug, only to accidentally spill all of the jug's contents. Starving, Abby attacks a neighbor and [[Vampire|drinks his blood]], killing him and forcing Thomas to dispose of the body.

On another night, Thomas hides in the back of another car, but is discovered. In the ensuing struggle, the car falls into a ditch and flips over. Trapped, Thomas pours [[Concentration|concentrated]] [[sulfuric acid]] on his face, rendering his features unrecognizable and bringing the story back to the first scene. Abby learns what happened and visits Thomas, who lets her drink his blood before falling to his death. That night, Owen is awakened by Abby, who insists he verbally invite her in. She spends the night in his bed and agrees to be his girlfriend.

The next day, Owen's class goes ice-skating on a river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen hits Kenny with a metal pole, splitting his left ear. At the same moment, the students spot the neighbor's body encased in the ice.

Later, Owen tries to make a blood pact with Abby. Seeing blood, Abby reveals her vampire form and flees, feeding on another neighbor. The next night, Abby admits to Owen that she is a vampire and that Thomas was not her father. Owen discovers an aged photo of her with Thomas as a young boy.

Owen sneaks out to spend the night at Abby's. In the morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's apartment and finds her asleep, only to be distracted by Owen. Abby wakes and attacks the detective, killing him. Abby tells Owen she will have to leave town. They share a kiss and he watches tearfully as she enters a taxi and leaves.

During swim class, Kenny, Jimmy (Kenny's older brother), and their friends ambush Owen and begin to drown him, only to be [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] by Abby. The next day, Owen leaves town on a train, traveling with a large trunk. From inside, a message in Morse code is tapped out. Owen smiles and taps out a response.

==Production==
===Development===
According to [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]] executive producer [[Nigel Sinclair]], interest in the project initially began in the middle of 2007, before the original ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'' had screened for audiences.<ref>{{cite video | title = Let Me In: Nigel Sinclair Interview | url = http://www.movieweb.com/movie/let-me-in/nigel-sinclair-interview|publisher=MovieWeb.com|accessdate=March 31, 2011 }}</ref>

The rights for the English-language film were later acquired by Hammer Films at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], where ''Let the Right One In'' won the "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," and [[Matt Reeves]] was quickly introduced as the director.<ref name="variety_remake">{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992833.html |title=Matt Reeves bites into 'Right One'|last=Fleming|first=Michael|author2=Dave McNary |date=September 24, 2008|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17930|title='Let Me In' Officially Begins Production in New Mexico|last=Misak|first=Brad|date=November 2, 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}</ref> [[Tomas Alfredson]], the director of the Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/3356-tomas-alfredson-new-wave-vampires |title=Tomas Alfredson: New Wave Vampires |work=Total Sci-Fi Online |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201235025/http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/3356-tomas-alfredson-new-wave-vampires |archivedate=December 1, 2010 |df= }}</ref> Hammer Films producer [[Simon Oakes]] initially referred to the film with "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is. It's not a reimagining; the same beats [are there], maybe the scares are a little bit more scary."<ref name="fearnet_remake" /> He later said, "I call it his [Reeves'] version.

Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist, on the other hand, says that Reeves told him that he "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" and so "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see."<ref name="JAL">{{cite web | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38839 | title = The Northlander Sits Down With The Writer Of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN! | date = October 23, 2008 | accessdate = November 18, 2008 }}</ref> Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting and terrifying film. I'm really excited about what it could be", he said.<ref name="mtv_remake">{{cite web| url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/11/14/exclusive-cloverfield-director-matt-reeves-reveals-let-the-right-one-in-remake-details/| title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Cloverfield' Director Matt Reeves Reveals 'Let The Right One In' Remake Details| last=Horowitz| first=Josh| date=November 14, 2008| publisher=[[Viacom]]| work=[[MTV]] Movies Blog| accessdate=May 19, 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219002815/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/11/14/exclusive-cloverfield-director-matt-reeves-reveals-let-the-right-one-in-remake-details/| archivedate=February 19, 2009| df=mdy-all}}</ref> In response to the criticism he said, "I can understand because of people's love of the [original] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film.

===Adapting and writing===
In [[Film adaptation|adapting the film]], a few adjustments were made, such as changing the names of the [[protagonist]]s to Owen and Abby,<ref name="biz_remake">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bruce-willis-jessica-alba-chace-crawford-for-sale-at-cannes-2009-5|title=Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Chace Crawford For Sale At Cannes| last=Lewis| first= Hilary| date=13 May 2009|publisher=''The Business Insider''|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> and moving the setting from the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Blackeberg]] to "a small [[New Mexico]] town."<ref name="dread" /> Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story."<ref name="Harley"/> The filmmakers have noted that "they intend to forge a unique identity for ''Let Me In'', placing it firmly in an American context", while at the same time paying respect to the original.<ref name="dread"/> In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating "There are things that [Lindqvist] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it."<ref name="Harley"/> In adapting the story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of [[good and evil]]. He used [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire speech]]" as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the [[Soviets]]". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/07/26/let-me-in-director-matt-reeves-hopes-to-set-his-work-apart-from-let-the-right-one-in/|title=How 'Let Me In' Director Matt Reeves Hopes To Set His Work Apart From 'Let The Right One In'|publisher=MTV|date=July 26, 2010|accessdate=April 5, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001194115/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/07/26/let-me-in-director-matt-reeves-hopes-to-set-his-work-apart-from-let-the-right-one-in|archivedate=October 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

That was important."<ref>{{cite web|author=Radish, Christina|url=http://collider.com/matt-reeves-interview-let-me-in-invisible-woman/73857/|title=Matt Reeves Exclusive Interview LET ME IN DVD/Blu-ray; Plus an INVISIBLE WOMAN Update|work=Collider|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref>

[[Method Studios]] was contracted to handle the film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor [[Sean Faden]], worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes proved to be a challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the "car-crash" sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person.<ref name="ReevesCommentary">{{cite video | title = Let Me In, Blu-ray: Special Features (Matt Reeves commentary) | medium = [[Blu-ray]] | publisher = [[Overture Films]]| date=February 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="DMWMag">{{cite web|last=Hurst |first=Adriene |url=http://www.digitalmedia-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2810:let-me-in&catid=76:feature-articles-from-digital-media-world-magazine&Itemid=96 |title=LET ME IN |work=Digital Media World Magazine |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016092606/http://digitalmedia-world.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2810%3Alet-me-in&catid=76%3Afeature-articles-from-digital-media-world-magazine&Itemid=96 |archivedate=October 16, 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name="AWN">{{cite web| last=Desowitz| first=Bill| url=http://www.awn.com/articles/article/creepy-let-me|title=A Creepy ''Let Me In''|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}</ref> Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a "rotisserie" in front of a [[Chroma key|blue screen]] which could simulate the car's roll down the hill.

Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control."<ref name="DMWMag" /> Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.<ref name="AWN" />

===Music and soundtrack===
{{Main article|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}
'''''Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' is the film's [[soundtrack album]]. It was released by [[Varèse Sarabande]] on October 12, 2010. The [[Film score|score]] was composed by [[Michael Giacchino]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38397/let-me-in-score-be-composed-michael-giacchino| title=Let Me In Score to Be Composed by Michael Giacchino|work=DreadCentral.com|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult "balancing act" for some scenes. He mentioned, "I was always trying to say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [Reeves] was like, 'no, put it in!'" In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, "…it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as far as what everyone's intentions are in the film.<ref name="Giacchino">{{cite web|author=Gilchrist,Todd|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/09/30/interview-composer-michael-giacchino-let-me-in/| title=Composer Michael Giacchino on 'Let Me In,' Monsters and the Movies in Your Head|work=Moviefone|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref>

''Let Me In'' was not well received by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims that he was not remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote "The movie he’s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them."<ref>{{cite web| first= Josh |last=Tyler |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Let-Me-In-4871.html |title=Let Me In Movie Review|work=CinemaBlend|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in ''Let Me In'' than in the Alfredson version."<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/46029/let-me-in | title= Let Me In: DVD Talk Review | work = DVD Talk|date=October 1, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> Beth Accomando wrote, "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original."

===Author's response===
John Ajvide Lindqvist, author of ''Let the Right One In'', who also wrote the screenplay for the original Swedish film, was pleased with ''Let Me In''. He said:
{{Quote|I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. ''Let the Right One In'' is a great Swedish movie. ''Let Me In'' is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But ''Let Me In'' puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. ''Let Me In'' is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful.
