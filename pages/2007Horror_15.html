Kate ([[Mary Stockley]]) is a [[workaholic]] with a failing relationship with her boyfriend.

The [[police]] come to her the next day and reveal to her that her friend has, in fact, died. Kate, for a moment begins to wonder if she is responsible. She then realizes that it was not she who killed her friend, but her friend's double. One by one Kate's friends are hunted downed and killed with strange '[[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s' removed from their bodies by their attackers. Kate then teams up with her boyfriend in hopes that they can escape the same fate.<ref name=locator/>
