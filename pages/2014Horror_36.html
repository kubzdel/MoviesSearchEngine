==Plot==
Ineffectual and sexually inexperienced artist Carter (David Phillip Carollo) wants desperately to lose his virginity, but only to the right person. He thinks that he's found the right person in Riley (Melissa O'Brien), a [[call girl]] with a strange birthmark on her right buttock. 

Carter's dreams of romance are soon ruined, as several Cthulhu-worshiping cultists of the [[Church of Starry Wisdom]] see this birthmark as a sign that Riley is destined to become the bride of Cthulhu and bear his child. 

It is up to Carter, aided by Edna Curwen (Helenmary Ball) and Squid (Sabrina Taylor-Smith), to find a way (with the aid of a spell from [[The Necronomicon]]) to stop the cult from fulfilling their plan to mate Riley to the Elder God.

==In-Jokes==
