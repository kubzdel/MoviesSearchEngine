==Plot==
While sharknado fighter Fin Shepard is in Washington, D.C. to receive a [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from the president, another sharknado strikes, devastating the nation's capital. Fin and the president work together to defeat the sharks, and the storm unexpectedly subsides. Fearing that April, who is at [[Universal Orlando]] with their daughter Claudia and her mother May, is in danger, Fin heads for Florida. On his way there, he encounters a "fognado", which is stopped by Nova Clarke, [[Sharknado|his former employee]], who has become a hardened sharknado storm tracker, and her partner Lucas Stevens.

They stop at a military airport where they get clearance to use a fighter jet to bomb other forming sharknados. Lucas sacrifices himself to blow up a sharknado so that Nova and Fin can escape. They detonate a bomb in a sharknado over the [[Daytona 500]] race. After crash landing in Orlando at the [[Universal Orlando Resort]], they begin to search for the rest of the family. They are not able to get in touch with Claudia since she left her phone behind earlier, but April retrieves it from one of the ride managers who held on to it. Eventually, Fin and Nova reunite with April, Claudia, her new boyfriend Billy, and May who have survived the sharknado that has hit the theme park. They then rush to take cover inside the Universal Orlando globe, which rolls around admist chaotic fleeing crowds before coming to rest atop [[Islands of Adventure#Port of Entry|Pharos Lighthouse]].

Realizing that the numerous storms will soon combine into a massive sharknado wall that will destroy the entire East Coast (dubbed the "Feast Coast" by the media), Fin calls in a favor from his estranged father, former NASA colonel Gil Shepard, to help him with a risky plan to destroy the storm from space. Gil, Fin, April, and Nova reach [[Cape Canaveral]] where they plan to use a top-secret [[Space Shuttle]] to blow up tanks of rocket fuel in the storm. They head inside to prepare, while Claudia and Billy fend off incoming sharks by using guns. They share a kiss and begin to head back inside, but Billy is killed when a shark lands on him. While Nova clears a path, Gil, Fin, and April launch into space where they detonate the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]], but it fails to stop the wall of sharknados. Gil deploys "Plan B", activating a Reagan-era [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] satellite laser weapon, stranding himself in space since there is not enough fuel to propel all of them back to Earth. This time, the sharknados are destroyed, but the beam causes the sharks to propel into space, attacking the shuttle. Fin fights them off using an energy-beam chainsaw; he and April are eaten by two different sharks which fall back down to Earth. Though the sharks are charred from [[atmospheric entry]], Fin emerges from his shark unharmed and discovers that April also safely returned the same way, and that she had given birth during the descent. As the family and Nova reunite, Fin names his newborn son after his father, who has landed on [[the moon]]. April is about to recover Fin's father's badge when a Shuttle fragment apparently crushes her.

==Production==
''Sharknado 3'' was filmed on location at Universal Orlando, São Paulo Brazil, Northern New Jersey, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C.

Initially, the President was going to be played by businessman and later president [[Donald Trump]], but he later declined the role due to him preparing [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|a real presidential campaign]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abramovitch|first1=Seth|title=How 'Sharknado' Casts Its C-Listers and Nearly Landed Trump as President|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-sharknado-casts-c-listers-landed-trump-as-president-1025676|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2 August 2017|language=en}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 36% score with an average rating of 3.9/10, based on 33 critics. The consensus reads: "''Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!'' bites off more than it can chew, leaving viewers with an overlong mess that isn't even bad enough to be good."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sharknado_3_oh_hell_no/ | title=Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! | website=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of a 100, which indicates mixed or average reviews based on 19 critics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/sharknado-3-oh-hell-no! | title=Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! | website=Metacritic | accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref>

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the self-reference gag was beginning to yield diminishing returns. He further added that the question is whether the parent company's insatiable appetite to cash in would hasten the feeding frenzy.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Brian|last=Lowry | url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/reviews/tv-review-sharknado-3-oh-hell-no-review-ian-ziering-tara-reid-1201542225/ | title=TV Review: ‘Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!’ | magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 20, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015}}</ref> Don Kaplan of The New York Daily News said the movie left a fishy taste behind.<ref>{{cite news |first=Don|last=Kaplan | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/sharknado-3-review-campy-sequel-not-jawsome-article-1.2292357 | title=‘Sharknado 3’ review: Campy sequel with Ian Ziering is not jawsomely funny anymore | newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] | date=July 14, 2015 | accessdate=July 20, 2015}}</ref> Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said Sharknado 3's absurdities was turned to funny levels.

An ad campaign that commenced after the film promoted a [[Twitter]] campaign offering fans the chance to decide her fate with the hashtags "#AprilLives" or "#AprilDies", with the results to be revealed in ''Sharknado 4''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/sharknado-4-director-anthony-c-ferrante-teases-another-sequel-1201545122/ |title=‘Sharknado 4’ Announced: Director Anthony C.

===Crossover===
A promotional trailer reveals that Ziering also makes an appearance as Fin Shepard in ''Lavalantula'', which debuted on July 25, 2015, the Saturday after ''Sharknado 3''{{'}}s Wednesday premiere.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msn505cckDI|title=Lavalantula Promo - July 25 on Space|date=15 July 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref> This indicates that it takes place in a shared universe. As he says he has "shark problems right now", this may indicate that the events of ''Lavalantula'' take place just before or concurrent with ''Sharknado 3''. [[Steve Guttenberg]], the star of ''Lavalantula'', appears in ''Sharknado: The 4th Awakens", reprising the role of Colton West in cameo; [[Michael Winslow]] also appears in both films, but as different characters.
