'''''Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters''''' is a 2013 [[dark fantasy]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film|horror]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Tommy Wirkola]]. It is a continuation to the [[German folklore]] [[fairy tale]] "[[Hansel and Gretel]]", in which the titular siblings are now grown up and working as a duo of [[witch]] exterminators for hire. The film stars [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Famke Janssen]], [[Peter Stormare]], [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]], [[Pihla Viitala]] and [[Derek Mears]].

Originally scheduled for release in March 2012, ''Hansel & Gretel'' was delayed for ten months to accommodate Renner's appearances in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|The Bourne Legacy]]'' and to give Wirkola time to shoot a [[post-credits scene]]. It premiered in North America on January 25, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX 3D]], as well in [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] motion theaters and select international [[4DX]] theaters, and was rated R in the United States. The film had its home media release on June 11, including a longer, unrated version on [[Blu-ray]].

The film was panned by mainstream critics, particularly for what they saw as its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing the film as unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic [[box office]] on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Following the commercial success of the film, which was planned as the first part of a series, its sequel is currently in development.

==Plot==
Abandoned by their father deep in a forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a [[Gingerbread#Gingerbread houses and decorations|gingerbread house]] and are captured by a [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Witchcraft|witch]]. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed [[Witch-hunt|witch hunters]], slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic]]. He needs a shot of [[insulin]] every few hours or he will get sick and die.{{#tag:ref|In Tommy Wirkola's original treatment, Gretel developed an eating disorder, but that idea was dropped.<ref name=co/>|group=N}}

Now adult, witch hunters Hansel and Gretel arrive in the town of [[Augsburg]] and immediately prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing a beautiful young woman named Mina for witchcraft. Mayor Englemann tells the crowd that he has hired the siblings to rescue several children presumed abducted by witches. Berringer hires trackers for the same mission in the hopes of disgracing the mayor and cementing his power. All but one of the sheriff's party are killed that night by the powerful grand witch Muriel, who sends one man back to the town tavern as a warning to the locals. Hansel and Gretel, along with the Mayor's deputy Jackson, capture the horned witch and interrogate her. They discover that the witches are preparing for the coming [[wikt:blood moon|Blood Moon]], where they plan to sacrifice twelve children to gain immunity to fire, their greatest weakness.

Muriel, accompanied by her witches and a [[troll]] named Edward, attacks the town and abducts the final child. Muriel kills Jackson and launches Gretel [[defenestration|out a window]], rendering her unconscious. Gretel is rescued by Ben, a local teenager who is a fan of theirs and plans to be a witch hunter himself. Hansel grabs onto a fleeing witch by her broomstick, but falls and is lost in the forest.
 
The next morning, Mina finds Hansel hanging from a tree. She takes him to a nearby spring where she heals his wounds and has sex with him. Gretel searches for Hansel in the forest, but is attacked by Sheriff Berringer and his posse. The men capture and beat Gretel before being stopped by Edward who kills the sheriff and his men. Edward tends to Gretel's wounds and tells her that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin which they discover is both a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand [[white witch]] named Adrianna who married a farmer, explaining the siblings' immunity to black magic. On the night of the last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna too powerful and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, Muriel revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.
 
Hansel wakes up with Mina, who reveals herself to be a white witch. She heals his wounds again and uses a [[grimoire]] to bless Hansel's arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben head out to disrupt the Blood Moon [[Witches' Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Mina begins slaughtering dark witches with a [[Gatling gun]], while Hansel squares off against Muriel's witches and frees the children. Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel flees on a broomstick, but Ben manages to shoot her and forces her to crash. Hansel goes after Muriel while Gretel stops to revive Edward. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house. Muriel wounds Ben and kills Mina before Hansel shoots her several times, knocking her into the house. Gretel arrives and the pair engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with Gretel decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a [[pyre]] and collect their reward for rescuing the children. They head out on their next witch hunt accompanied by Ben and Edward.

During the credits, Hansel and Gretel are able to slay a Desert Witch.

==Extended cut==

Aside from additional profanity, gore, and sexual content, and a few extra lines, the extended version features a few extra scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=328186|title=Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters (Comparison: Theatrical Version - Unrated Extended Cut)|last=Wurm|first=Gerald|work=Movie-Censorship.com|date=July 8, 2013|accessdate=October 22, 2013}}</ref> In one scene, Berringer blames the Mayor for the witches' attack and murders him in public. The scene where Berringer and his goons assault Gretel is also extended; it occurs in between the scene where Mina heals Hansel and has sex with him, and shows that the men plan to rape Gretel right before Edward kills them.

==Production==
Wirkola got the idea to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being discovered by [[Gary Sanchez Productions]], Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with [[Paramount Pictures]] and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the [[Babelsberg Studio]]s in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand to prepare for the physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he was adamant about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.

===Development===
{{quote box|quote=Blood and gore and action, all the stuff that I love...It's definitely an R-rated movie, the first draft has a lot of blood and guts. First and foremost, it's an [[Action film|action movie]], I think, with [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. And of course some [[Black comedy|dark humor]] as well. But the action and horror are the most important feelings I want.<ref>Turek, Ryan (2009-06-19).

''Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'' is the first [[English language]] film and the first big [[Film studio|studio]] production of Norwegian writer and director Wirkola, up to this point best known for his 2009 Nazi [[Zombie film|zombie-themed]], [[Independent film|independent]] [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] film ''[[Dead Snow]]''. Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from [[Gary Sanchez Productions]] after the screening of ''Dead Snow'' at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]: "So my first meeting, my first day in [[Los Angeles|LA]] was with those guys and I pitched ''Hansel and Gretel'' and they loved it. And they took me to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] two days after and we sold it."<ref name=tw/> In 2013, Wirkola commented, "I'm still surprised that they went for it, because it's a crazy, rock n' roll script. It's full throttle, there's lots of blood and gore and bad language, I often wonder how I got this movie made. It's all across the world now. But people really seem to respond to it, which is what we hoped, that people would enjoy this ride."<ref name=nz/>

An announcement of ''Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters'' sparked a production of several other "[[Hansel and Gretel]]"–based films made by different studios, including [[The Asylum]]'s [[mockbuster]] ''[[Hansel & Gretel (2013 film)|Hansel & Gretel]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/hansel-gretel-blu-ray-dvd |title=Hansel & Gretel (Blu-ray / DVD) &#124; Horror Movie, DVD, & Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=2013-01-24}}</ref> [[Syfy]]'s ''Witchslayer Gretl'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/syfy-dusts-hansel-gretl-new-forest-article-1.1027586 |title=Syfy dusts off Hansel and Gretl for new look at what really might have gone down in that forest |work=Daily News |date=2012-02-25 |location=New York}}</ref> and [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]'s ''Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Foy|first=Scott|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/hansel-gretel-warriors-witchcraft-dvd |title=Hansel & Gretel: Warriors of Witchcraft (DVD) &#124; Horror Movie, DVD, & Book Reviews, News, Interviews at Dread Central |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=2013-01-24}}</ref> The film was also a part of an overall [[Hollywood]] trend of witch-themed films, among them ''[[Beautiful Creatures (2013 film)|Beautiful Creatures]]'' (which also stars Thomas Mann) and ''[[Oz the Great and Powerful]]'', set to be released that same season.<ref name="witches">{{cite web|first=James|last=Mottram |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1130966/season-witches-hollywoods-new-villains-meet-match-hansel-and |title=Season of the witches - Hollywood's new villains meet match in 'Hansel and Gretel' &#124; South China Morning Post |publisher=Scmp.com |date=2013-01-23}}</ref><ref>[http://cinemovie.tv/coming-soon/2013-preview-season-of-the-witch/ 2013 Movie Preview: Season of the Witch], CineMovie, 18 December 2012</ref> The project was given a budget of $50 million,<ref name="bo">{{cite news|last=Fritz |first=Ben |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-hansel-gretel-parker20130124,0,2625187.story |title='Hansel & Gretel' will bewitch box office this weekend |publisher=latimes.com |date=2013-01-24}}</ref> co-financed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].<ref name="MGM">Finke, Nikki & Fleming, Mike (February 17, 2011).

===Concept and design===
{{quote box|quote=I loved [[fairy tale]]s growing up. I used to listen to them on tapes and "[[Hansel and Gretel|Hansel & Gretel]]" scared the hell out of me and it always stayed in the back of my head. I always wondered what happened to those characters.<ref name=making>[http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/film/features/11801/making-hansel-gretel-witch-hunters Making Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters], Time Out Sydney, 30 Jan 2013</ref>|source=–Tommy Wirkola in 2013|width=30%|}}

Wirkola said, "I have a strong memory from my childhood of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered what would have happened to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh."<ref name=off/> Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at [[Bond University]] in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a [[short film]],<ref name=co/> and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it."<ref>Peter Michell, [http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/a-crum-of-an-idea-led-to-hansel--gretel-hit-film-20130129-2dhxt.html A crum of an idea led to Hansel & Gretel hit film], theage.com.au, January 29, 2013</ref> {{Clear}}

Gary Sanchez Productions' [[Adam McKay]] said in 2010, "The idea is, they've grown up and they hunt witches. It's a hybrid sort of old-timey feeling, yet there's [[pump-action shotgun]]s. Modern technology but in an old style. We heard it and we were just like, 'That's a freakin' [[Media franchise|franchise]]! You could make three of those!'"<ref>Billington, Alex (2009-04-30).

===Casting and characters===

[[Jeremy Renner]], who played the film's adult Hansel, has stated that his initial attraction came from a [[one sheet]] he was given even before seeing the script, showing Hansel and Gretel walking away and a witch burning at a stake in the background, which he found "incredibly interesting"<ref name=jr/> (this scene was included in the finished film). He added, "When I read the script, my first thought was, 'I can't believe this hasn't been done yet.' It's such a great idea with so much potential. That dynamic was definitely a big thing, I loved that what Tommy [Wirkola] wrote left so much room for character."<ref name=jr>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeremyleerenner.com/news/jan-17-2013-jeremy-renner-interview-for-hansel-gretel-witch-hunters-flicksandbits-com/ |title=Jan 17, 2013 – Jeremy Renner Interview For ‘Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters’ (flicksandbits.com) |publisher=Jeremy Lee Renner |date=}}</ref> Wirkola said he wanted Renner in the role after seeing him in ''[[The Hurt Locker]]''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz9GoQ73Kxg Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters Interview Tommy Wirkola], TvShowsandseries, 4 January 2013</ref> Wirkola, who described Hansel as the "loose cannon" of the duo,<ref name=wi/> gave him an additional [[character flaw]] of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], in addition to the psychological scars that Hansel shares with his sister (in the original idea for the short film, Gretel was also suffering from [[eating disorder]]<ref name=co/>).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO6rhDud4lM Yesenia Interviews Tommy Wirkola, "Hansel & Gretel 3D" Director], Yesi OnAir, 20 January 2013</ref> Renner said it was a great escape for him "as this was a fairytale with no stress like the other action movies I'd done recently.

Örvarsson had previously scored ''[[Season of the Witch (2011 film)|Season of the Witch]]'' so initially he was "a bit apprehensive" to work on another witchcraft film but was "too fond of the story to say no and found Tommy Wirkola's take on the subject matter to be very refreshing."<ref name=atli>Daniel Schweiger, [http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=10645 Interview with Atli Örvarsson], Film Music Magazine, January 7, 2013</ref> Örvarsson found it easier to collaborate with Wirkola due to their shared [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] heritage and said that their discussions about the music for the film "might have had some of the most cold and dark humor of any Hollywood music meetings."<ref name=atli/>

The film's [[soundtrack]], ''Hansel & Gretel Witch Hunters - Music from the Motion Picture'', was released in [[MP3]] format by [[Paramount Music]] on January 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Hansel-Gretel-Witch-Hunters-Picture/dp/B00B18PJPG/ |title=Hansel & Gretel Witch Hunters - Music from the Motion Picture: Atli Örvarsson: MP3 Downloads |publisher=Amazon.com |date=}}</ref><ref name="Hansel and Gretel OST">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hansel-gretel-witch-hunters/id594633542 |title=''Hansel & Gretel Witch Hunters - Music from the Motion Picture'' |publisher=[[iTunes]]}}</ref> A physical soundtrack album was released on January 29, 2013 from [[La-La Land Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lalalandrecords.com/Site/HandG.html |title=Hansel & Gretel Witch Hunters |publisher=[[La-La Land Records]] |date=}}</ref> The song "[[Bundy (song)|Bundy]]" by Norwegian rock band [[Animal Alpha]] is used during the film's end credits, but is not included on the film's soundtrack.

===Theatrical release===
Initially slated for a March 2, 2012 release,<ref name="MGM"/> the film was pushed by [[Paramount Pictures]] to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013.<ref>Finke, Nikki (2012-01-09). [http://www.deadline.com/2012/01/paramount-shifts-release-dates-for-hansel-and-gretel-two-other-pics "'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw"]. ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' 2012-01-19.</ref> Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: "We'd finished it but we were still discussing adding a [[Post-credits scene|coda scene]], which we were able to shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [Renner] had ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Avengers]]'' and ''[[The Bourne Legacy (film)|Bourne]]'' coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us."<ref name=making/> Wirkola said that "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''Bourne'' and ''The Avengers''. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay.<ref name=tw2/> The first [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for the film was released on September 5, 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2198487/Jeremy-Renner-Gemma-Arterton-Hansel--Gretel-Witch-Hunters.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Not your average fairytale: Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters as Hollywood re-imagines Brothers Grimm |author=Madison, Jennifer |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' |date=2012-09-05 |location=London}}</ref>

The film topped the weekend's North American box office with $19 million, the first day's under performance blamed on bad weather on the U.S. East Coast.

Overall, ''Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'' was Paramount's fourth highest-grossing film of 2013, following new graphic novel and franchise entries: ''[[World War Z]]'', ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', and ''[[G.I. Joe: Retaliation]]'', respectively.<ref>{{cite web | last=Acuna |first=Kirsten |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/most-successful-movie-studios-of-2013-2014-1 |title= The Most Successful Movie Studios of 2013|publisher=Business Insider |date= Jan 5, 2014 }}</ref> It is estimated that, following published production costs, marketing and advertising fees, and the percentage of overseas revenue that was lost by the domestic studio, similar fantasy reboots such as ''[[Snow White and the Huntsman]]'', ''[[Mirror Mirror (film)|Mirror, Mirror]]'', ''[[Jack the Giant Slayer]]'', ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'', and ''[[I, Frankenstein]]'' fail to match the total studio winnings for ''Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters'', which makes it one of the most financially successful films of the fantasy-reboot genre, despite having the smallest estimated budget and lowest [[Metascore]] of the recent entries.<ref name="BoxOfficeMojo"/>

==Sequel==
On March 19, 2013, Paramount announced that a [[sequel]] to the film is in the works due to overseas box office numbers. ''Hansel & Gretel'' producers Ferrell, McKay, Messick, and Flynn were reported to return.<ref name=reuters/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2013/03/20/hansel--gretel-witch-hunters-sequel-on-the-way|title='Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' sequel on the way|publisher=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}</ref> In June 2013, McKay officially confirmed his involvement and said that "everyone feels like as good as the first one is, we can really jack it up a level with the second one. So, fingers crossed everyone will come back" (including Renner and Arterton).<ref name=cb/> McKay suggested that Paramount might insist harder to make the film rated PG-13 this time.<ref name=pg/> Talking about Wirkola's "pretty insane" ideas for the second film, McKay said this could be one of those instances where the sequel does go further than the first one."<ref>{{cite web|last=Orange|first=B.

In September 2014, Wirkola announced that he would not be returning to direct the sequel: "I have been lately attached to a few more things, it's just a matter of time and priorities. I did ''[[Dead Snow]]'', then ''Hansel & Gretel'', and then ''[[Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead|Dead Snow 2]]''. I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels.
