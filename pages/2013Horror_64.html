==Plot==
A ship from [[Somalia]] docks at [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. As the workers disembark, one is seen to be infected. He picks up his pay and then disappears into the crowd unnoticed. His coming to India triggers a zombie infestation. Meanwhile, American Nicholas Burton ([[Joseph Millson]]), a turbine engineer, works at a wind farm in [[Rajasthan]], 30 kilometers from [[Jaipur]]. Nicholas is in a long-distance relationship with an Indian woman, Ishani Sharma (Meenu), from [[Mumbai]]. Ishani's parents are aware of her relationship with Nicholas and do not approve of it.

Ishani goes to a hospital for a check up and sees lots of people with bite wounds. Meanwhile, as he is working atop a wind turbine, Nicholas sees a family evacuate their home in hurry. Ishani phones Nicholas and informs him that she is pregnant, and she is worried about her safety with the incidents happening on the streets.

Nicholas phones his friend Max, who is aware of the fighting in the streets, but believes it to be fighting among two communities. Nicholas soon has his first encounter with the zombies and phones Ishani, promising to come for her. He phones Max again, who informs him that American citizens are being evacuated from India and asks him to show up at either [[New Delhi]] or Mumbai to escape from India. Nicholas instead keeps his promise to Ishani, going back to get her. He soon realizes that the dead are coming back to life. By the time Nicholas finishes his phone call, he is surrounded by zombies and gets trapped in a [[powered paragliding]] institute. Unable to get back to his jeep, he paraglides off the building to safety.

Nicholas crash lands in a village and rescues an orphan named Javed (Anand Goyal) from zombies. Javed turns out to be a guide, and he offers to help Nicholas reach Mumbai. They take a car from the house of a dead local tour operator; Javed injures his hand in the process. They reach a military checkpoint and see military personnel killing people with wounds, so Nicholas and Javed take another route through the mountains, having to ditch their car after an accident on the road. They soon find a motorbike and hit the road again.

Meanwhile, the conditions in Mumbai are deteriorating rapidly. Ishani's mother is bitten and she is dying. Ishani's father, a preacher, starts believing that the end is near. The father and daughter bond again with death so near. Javed and Nicholas stop for food and their motorbike is stolen by a desperate man. Now on foot, they walk through the desert. Javed is rescued by the [[Indian Army]] and is separated from Nicholas. Nicholas finds the stolen bike and rides all the way to Mumbai.

Ishani's father gets bitten, and Nicholas finally reaches her house. Ishani's father now realizes that Nicholas truly loves his daughter. He allows them to go and stays behind to succumb to his wounds. Nicholas and Ishani reach a camp set up by the military where they find Javed. The camp is bombed by the military, and the camp building collapses. The movie ends with Nicholas, Javed and Ishani trapped with their fates unknown.
