'''''30 Days of Night''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] based on the [[comic book]] [[30 Days of Night|miniseries of the same name]]. The film is directed by [[David Slade]] and stars [[Josh Hartnett]] and [[Melissa George]]. The story focuses on an [[Alaska]]n town beset by vampires as it enters into a thirty-day long [[polar night]].

''30 Days of Night'' was originally pitched as a comic, then as a film, but it was rejected. Years later, [[Steve Niles]] showed [[IDW Publishing]] the idea and it took off. The film was produced on a budget of $30 million and grossed over $75 million at the box office during its six-week run starting on October 19, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed.

A [[sequel]], ''[[30 Days of Night: Dark Days|Dark Days]]'', was released on October 5, 2010 straight to home video. A prequel mini-series, ''[[30 Days of Night: Blood Trails|Blood Trails]]'', was released on [[FEARnet|FEARnet.com and FEARnet On Demand]] in 2007.

==Plot==
The town of [[Barrow, Alaska]] is preparing for its annual "30 Days of Night", a period during the winter when there is a month-long [[polar night]]. As the town gets ready, a stranger ([[Ben Foster]]) rows ashore from a large ship and sabotages the town's communications and transport to the outside world. Barrow's sheriff, [[Eben Olemaun|Eben Oleson]] ([[Josh Hartnett]]) investigates and also learns that his estranged wife, [[Stella Olemaun|Stella]] ([[Melissa George]]), missed the last plane and must stay the 30 days. That night, a [[coven]] of [[feral]] [[vampire]]s, led by Marlow ([[Danny Huston]]), attack and slaughter most of the townspeople, forcing Eben, Stella, Eben's younger brother Jake ([[Mark Rendall]]), and several other survivors to take shelter in a boarded-up house with a hidden attic. Marlow finds the stranger locked up in the station.  The stranger believed Marlow was going to turn him into a vampire. Marlow thanks him for doing what he asked, and then snaps his neck.  Marlow ironically comments to his fellow vampires: "The things they believe."

Eighteen days later, when a blizzard hits, the group uses the [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] to go to the general store for supplies, but are stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris ([[Megan Franich]]), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snow plow operator, Beau ([[Mark Boone Junior]]), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter ([[Nathaniel Lees]]), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.

Two weeks later, Stella and Eben see the deputy, Billy ([[Manu Bennett]]), signaling them with a flashlight and bring him back to the station, after finding out he killed his family to save them from a more painful death. The trio find the others have made for the [[utilidor]], a power and sewage treatment station that still has power, and head over there but are separated after Stella saves Gail Robbins (Rachel Maitland-Smith), a young girl whose family was slaughtered by a vampire named Zurial (John Rawls) who was stalking her. Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor but are attacked by Arvin ([[Andrew Stehlin]]), who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, painfully grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.

As the month comes to an end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy evidence of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while she stares at the sky, coming to grips with what has happened.

==Production==
===Development===
''30 Days of Night'' author [[Steve Niles]] conceived of the story in the form of a comic, but—after meeting a lack of interest in initial pitches—tried to pitch it as a film. When this did not work out, Niles shelved the idea until he showed it to [[IDW Publishing]]. IDW published the comic and [[Ben Templesmith]] provided the artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/29592/steve_niles_interview.html |title=Steve Niles interview |work=Den of the Geek |author=Sarah Dobbs & Ron Hogan |date=Apr 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621072714/http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/29592/steve_niles_interview.html |archivedate=June 21, 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-02 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> When Niles and his agent, Jon Levin, shopped the comic around again as a potential film adaptation, Niles found that the idea "went shockingly well," with [[Sam Raimi]] and Senator International picking up the property rights based on the original concept and Templesmith's unique mood and concepts for the vampires.<ref>{{cite news|author=SCI FI Wire |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=42890 |title=30 Days grabbed Raimi's Eye |website=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135029/http://scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&id=42890 |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>

According to Raimi, the potential project was "unlike the horror films of recent years".<ref>{{cite news | author=Jonah Weiland | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=1266 | title=Niles Looks Forward to At Least '30 Days' of Screen Time | website=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=2002-07-22 | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}</ref>

Following the publication of the [[30 Days of Night|''30 Days of Night'' comic book]] [[miniseries]] in 2002, studios, including [[DreamWorks]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and Senator International, bid in the $1 million range for rights to a potential vampire film based on the story. Raimi expressed interest in adapting the miniseries and was negotiating a production deal with his producing partner [[Robert Tapert]] to establish a label with Senator Entertainment, of which Senator International is the sales division.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/news.html |title=Raimi Mulls ''30 Days'' |website=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=2002-07-15 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824035206/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue274/news.html |archivedate=August 24, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> In July 2002, Senator International acquired the rights for ''30 Days of Night'' in a seven-figure deal with Raimi and Tapert attached as producers.

By October 2002, Niles was working on adapting ''30 Days of Night'' for the big screen, keeping the film true to the miniseries, though fleshing out the characters more significantly in the adaptation process.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ace MacDonald |url=http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/36/t/000265/p/1.html |title=Horror is October Month |publisher=Comicon.com |date=2002-10-14 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220213/http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ultimatebb.php/ubb/get_topic/f/36/t/000265/p/1.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> In February 2003, [[Columbia Pictures]] partnered with Senator International to work on ''30 Days of Night'', which was developing under Senator International's newly established production company, [[Ghost House Pictures]].

In September 2005, it was announced that director [[David Slade]] had signed on to ''30 Days of Night'', which would be distributed by Columbia Pictures mainly in North America and Mandate Pictures in international territories.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tatiana Siegel |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4917547-1.html |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |title=Slade has eyes for Col's 'Night' |date=2005-09-07 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ug9PTYjK?url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4917547-1.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> In March 2006, Slade revealed that [[screenwriter Brian Nelson]], who wrote the screenplay for Slade's previous film ''[[Hard Candy (film)|Hard Candy]]'', was writing a new draft of the ''30 Days of Night'' script, replacing Beattie's draft.<ref name="shh">{{cite news | author=Edward Douglas | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/91669-director-david-slade-on-30-days-of-night | title=David Slade on ''30 Days of Night'' | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-03-24 | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}</ref>  The director said that filming would begin in summer 2006 in Alaska and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="shh" />

===Casting===
In June 2006, it was announced that [[Josh Hartnett]] was cast as the husband of the married couple that serves as the town's sheriff team. Some criticized the choice because the main character (Eben Olemaun, with the last name changed to Oleson for the motion picture adaption) was originally Inuit in the comics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ghosthousepictures.comingsoon.net/news_article.php?articleid=24 |title=Hartnett in Flight with Sony 'Night' |date=2006-06-15 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019053049/http://ghosthousepictures.comingsoon.net/news_article.php?articleid=24 |archivedate=October 19, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> [[Melissa George]] joined the ''30 Days of Night'' cast as the wife of Hartnett's character.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.melissageorge.co.uk/films/30daysof.htm | title=30 Days of Night, Melissa George and Josh Hartnett | publisher=MelissaGeorge.co.uk | date=2006-07-31 | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}</ref> [[Danny Huston]] joined the cast as the leader of the vampires.<ref>{{cite news|author=Borys Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003119773 |title='Night' dawns for Huston in Col horror pic |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2006-09-11 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012075946/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/brief_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003119773 |archivedate=October 12, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Filming===
Filming did not begin immediately, but in a September 2006 interview, executive producer Mike Richardson said that ''30 Days of Night'' would be shot on [[35 mm film]], though there had been discussion to shoot the film on [[Genesis (Panavision)|Genesis]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Robert Sanchez | url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=429&Itemid=99 | title=Exclusive Interview: Part II With Dark Horse's Mike Richardson | publisher=IESB.net | date=2006-09-28 | accessdate=2006-10-13 }}</ref>  In an interview prior to filming, Slade explained that the illustrations of the graphic novel's illustrator, Ben Templesmith, would be reflected in production design. Slade also considered Nelson's draft to be the most faithful to the graphic novel. He also stated his intention to make a "scary vampire film", of which he didn't think there were many. "The rest of them, they fall into all kinds of traps. We're going to try to do our best... and one of the ways we have to do it is be more naturalistic than the graphic novel, because it's very over-the-top," said Slade.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniel Fienberg |url=http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-slade30daysofnight,0,7581795.story?coll=zap-news-headlines |title='Candy' Director Prepares for '30 Days of Night' |website=Zap2It.com |date=2006-04-13 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927213646/http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-slade30daysofnight%2C0%2C7581795.story?coll=zap-news-headlines |archivedate=September 27, 2006 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>  There was also concern expressed that while the vampires needed to communicate, talking might lessen the effect. To counter this, a fictional vampire language, with [[click consonant]]s, was constructed with the help of a professor of linguistics and the nearby University of Auckland.  Slade explained "we designed this really simple language that didn't sound like any particular accent that you would be aware of, that was based around really simple actions, eating, hunting, yes, no, really basic, because that's what vampires do."<ref>{{cite news|author=Cindy White |url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw17143.html |title=Director David Slade shines a light on Josh Hartnett and Melissa George to bring a new vision of vampires to the screen in ''30 Days of Night'' |publisher=SciFi Weekly |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2009-02-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420150746/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw17143.html |archivedate=April 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>
