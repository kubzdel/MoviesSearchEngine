== Plot ==
Mike and Brent are inexplicably coherent zombies who become self-aware during a zombie attack.  As Mike's memories slowly come back to him, he recalls wanting to visit his girlfriend so that he can tell her that he loves her.  Brent adopts a feral zombie which he dubs "Cheese", and they set off, not knowing that they are being tracked by an evil corporation.  Eventually captured by a zombie hunter hired by the corporation, the boys escape and make their way to Mike's girlfriend, who accepts him despite his condition.
