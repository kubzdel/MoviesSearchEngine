Victor ([[Vic Sotto]]) started drinking when his wife Linda ([[Iza Calzado]]) suddenly died although he keeps it from his son Tom Tom ([[BJ Forbes]]).

One day, Victor thinks of a way by which he can make others who are also mourning feel better—and make money in the process. With the help of two cohorts, Wally ([[Wally Bayola]]) and George ([[Jose Manalo]]), Victor passes himself off as an ''[[Spiritism|Ispiritist]]'' who can communicate with restless spirits for a price. His son has no idea that his dad is a fake medium and in fact, idolizes his father. He proudly tells his classmates that his father gets rids of ghosts for a living.

Victor is hired by Tom Tom’s school to speak to the ghost of a little girl and ask her to leave the campus. As his dad prepares, a surprised Tom Tom discovers that he can see and talk to Didith (Abigail Arazo), the little girl's ghost. She tells Tom Tom what needs to be done to calm her restless soul. Tom Tom obeys her instructions, and she stops haunting the school. Victor takes the credit and accepts the school’s thanks for a job well done.

After this success, Victor quickly finds more ghost-busting work. Impressed by how he handled the lady, Lalaine ([[Cindy Kurleto]]) hires Victor to rid her boarding house of a quartet of spirits (Teri Onor, Allan K., Soxy Topacio, [[Antonio Aquitania]]) who are scaring her boarders. Victor promptly accepts, believing Lalaine might be a possible wife for him and a mother for his son. However, Lalaine discovered his con not only losing a love interest but also the respect of his son.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pinoy favorite movie daddy|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=302803|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=PhilSTAR.com|date=20 October 2005|language=Filipino}}</ref> Just when Victor is about to apologize for his sins, he realizes that he has suddenly developed the power to see and speak to ghosts.
