==Plot==
The film is set in a 1970s era council block in [[Weston, Southampton]] set in the present-day  [[United Kingdom]]. Mark, an artist, wakes to find that he has been sealed into his flat with no way out. There is no electricity, no water and no communications with the outside world apart from a scary voice over the intercom, repeating the phrase, "please remain calm, the situation is under control". Strange figures in [[Hazmat suit]]s patrol the grounds outside and set up a military tent. Mark's neighbour, Sergei, breaks down the wall between their flats in order to discover why they have been sealed in and try to find a way to escape. Along the way, they team up with their fellow residents, Enid, Sally and Aiden.<ref name=Council/>

==Production==

Mcenery-West began working on the film in 2008 as he had always been attracted to contained thrillers and wanted to do a modern urban version of something like [[Lord of the Flies]].<ref name=Britflicks>{{cite web|title=Britflicks Talks To Neil Mcenery-West & David Lemon About Their Thriller 'Containment' |first=Leyton|last=Rocks|url=http://www.britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=15601|date=2014-11-07|accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref> Mcenery-West's original idea was focussed on the concept of just one character trapped alone in his apartment but Lemon expanded the story to include a diverse group of characters in order to avoid what Lemon felt was "one man on a stage".<ref name=Britflicks/>
