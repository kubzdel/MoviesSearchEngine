'''''Grindhouse''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] [[double feature]] co-written, produced, and directed by [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]]. The double feature consists of two feature-length segments, Rodriguez's ''[[Planet Terror]]'' and Tarantino's ''[[Death Proof]]'', and is bookended by fictional trailers for upcoming attractions (though two of the trailers, ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'' and ''[[Hobo with a Shotgun]]'', have since been made into movies), advertisements, and in-theater announcements. The film's title derives from the U.S. film industry term "[[grindhouse]]", which refers to (now mostly defunct) movie theaters specializing in [[B movie]]s, often [[exploitation film]]s, shown in a multiple-feature format. The film stars [[Rose McGowan]], [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Michael Biehn]], [[Jeff Fahey]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Kurt Russell]], [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Tracie Thoms]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and stuntwoman [[Zoë Bell]], who plays herself.

Rodriguez's segment, ''Planet Terror'', revolves around an outfit of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of [[zombie]]-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit, while Tarantino's segment, ''Death Proof'', focuses on a [[Misogyny|misogynistic]], psychopathic [[stuntman]] who targets young women, murdering them with his "death proof" stunt car. Each feature is preceded by faux [[Trailer (film)|trailers]] of exploitation films in other genres that were developed by other directors.

After the film was released on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In much of the rest of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on ''Grindhouse'''s fake trailers: ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'', ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''[[Hobo with a Shotgun]]''.

==''Planet Terror''==
{{Main|Planet Terror}}
In a rural town in Texas, [[go-go dancer]] Cherry Darling decides to quit her low-paying job and find another use for her numerous "useless" talents. She runs into mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by J. T. Hague. Meanwhile, a group of military officials, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon, are making a business transaction with a scientist named Abby for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename "Project Terror"). Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand and attempts to take him hostage. Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns its residents into deformed bloodthirsty, man-eating psychopaths, mockingly referred to as "sickos" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block and his abused, neglected anesthesiologist wife Dakota at a local hospital. As the patients quickly become enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night, struggling to find safety.

==Fictitious trailers==
Before each segment, there are [[trailer (film)|trailers]] advertising fake films, as well as vintage [[Snipe (theatrical)|theater snipes]] and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for ''Grindhouse''. "I didn't even know about it until I read it in the trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'"<ref name="Stone"/> Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, "We had so many ideas for trailers. I made ''Machete''. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to [[Eli Roth]] and to [[Edgar Wright]], and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then [[Rob Zombie]] came up to me in October at the [[Scream Awards]] and said, 'I have a trailer: ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'"<ref name="Wizard"/> Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down.<ref name="LATimes-Trailers">{{cite news|last=Olsen|first=Mark|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/01/entertainment/ca-middle1|title=These plotlines get hacked to bits|date=April 1, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Some Canadian screening releases included the [[South by Southwest]]-winning trailer ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.<ref name="Hobo">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/04/03/grindhouse-trailer-eisener.html|title=N.S. filmmaker's fake-movie trailer to open for ''Grindhouse''|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 3, 2007|publisher=CBC Arts}}</ref>

===''Machete''===
{{See also|Machete (2010 film)}}
Rodriguez wrote ''Machete'' in 1993 as a full feature for [[Danny Trejo]]. "I had cast him in ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]'' and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of [[Mexploitation]] movies like [[Charles Bronson]] or like [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]].' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it."<ref name="Stone"/> The trailer was made into a [[Machete (2010 film)|feature film]] which was released in September 2010; a sequel, ''[[Machete Kills]]'' (2013), followed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=''Grindhouseses'': Rodriguez to turn ''They Call Him Machete'' into Feature Length Movie|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=March 12, 2007|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/12/grindhouse-rodriguez-to-turn-they-call-him-machete-into-feature-length-movie/|publisher=Slash Film}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html  |title=Machete movie greenlit!|accessdate=May 12, 2009|last=Morris|first=Clint|date=May 14, 2007|publisher=Moviehole |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040812/http://www.moviehole.net/news/20070514_machete_movie_greenlit.html |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}</ref>

===''Werewolf Women of the SS''===
[[Rob Zombie]]'s contribution, ''Werewolf Women of the SS'', starred [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Fu Manchu]]; [[Udo Kier]] as Franz Hess, the commandant of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri]]; and [[Sybil Danning]] as [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew "Test" Martin]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov|Oleg "Vladimir Kozlov" Prudius]] also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, "Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a [[Nazi exploitation|Nazi movie]] or a [[Women in prison film|women-in-prison film]], and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]''; ''[[Fräulein Devil]]''; and ''[[Love Camp 7]]''—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre."<ref name="Stone"/> Zombie is also quoted as saying "I was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach."<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/>

===''Don't''===
[[Edgar Wright]]'s contribution, ''Don't'', was produced in the style of a 1970s' [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer House of Horror]] film trailer.<ref>{{cite news|first=Elaine |last=Lamkin |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20070108edgarwrightgrindhouse |title=Shaun of the Grindhouse |date=January 8, 2007 |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |publisher=Slash Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213023431/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20070108edgarwrightgrindhouse |archivedate=February 13, 2009 }}</ref> The trailer featured appearances from [[Jason Isaacs]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]], singer [[Katie Melua]], [[Lee Ingleby]], [[Georgina Chapman]], [[Emily Booth]], [[Stuart Wilson (actor)|Stuart Wilson]], [[Lucy Punch]], [[Rafe Spall]], Wright regulars [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Nick Frost]], and a voice-over by [[Will Arnett]].<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/film/us-box-office-horror-grindhouse-$1074930.htm |title=US box office horror for Grindhouse |date=April 9, 2007 |publisher=inthenews.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015153835/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/film/us-box-office-horror-grindhouse-%241074930.htm |archivedate=October 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Mark Gatiss]], [[MyAnna Buring]], [[Peter Serafinowicz]], [[Michael Smiley]] and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie "Mary" in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]''), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances.  To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists.<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/> According to Wright, "In the '70s, when [[American International Pictures|American International]] would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called ''[[Let Sleeping Corpses Lie (film)|The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue]]''. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called ''Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead''. But in the States, it was called ''Don't Open the Window''. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the hell is going on in the film."<ref name="Stone"/> On the [[Charlie Rose (talk show)|Charlie Rose]] talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8920808219270015571#30m05s|title=Charlie Rose – Lawrence Wright / Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 5, 2007}}</ref>

===''Thanksgiving''===
[[File:Thanksgiving032807.jpg|thumb|right|Eli Roth directs the fictitious trailer ''Thanksgiving''.]]
[[Eli Roth]]'s contribution is a promo for the slasher opus ''Thanksgiving''. Produced in the style of holiday-themed slasher films like ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'', ''[[April Fool's Day (1986 film)|April Fool's Day]]'' and ''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'',<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/> the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a [[pilgrim]]; [[Jordan Ladd]], [[Jay Hernandez]], and Roth himself as his intended victims; and [[Michael Biehn]] as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in ''Thanksgiving'' was based on a ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine slasher parody titled ''Arbor Day''.<ref name="Stone"/> Excerpts of the score from ''[[Creepshow]]'' were used in the faux trailer.

According to Roth, "My friend Jeff, who plays the killer pilgrim – we grew up in [[Massachusetts]], we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the [[Thanksgiving]] slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's [[bestiality|in love with a turkey]], and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'"<ref name="Stone"/> "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," Roth has stated, "because every shot is a [[money shot]]. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right."<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/>

Roth's fake trailer contained elements that almost earned ''Grindhouse'' an [[NC-17]] rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in the [[vulva]], and three [[decapitation]]s; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in an exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs [[fellatio]] on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, "Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But we had a great discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it."<ref name="LATimes-Trailers"/> Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinemablend.com/new/Eli-Roth-Confirms-He-s-Working-On-A-Thanksgiving-Movie-20320.html|title=Eli Roth Confirms He's Working On A Thanksgiving Movie|author=Eric Eisenberg}}</ref>

===''Hobo with a Shotgun''===

Some screenings of ''Grindhouse'' (mainly in Canada) also featured a fake trailer for a film titled ''Hobo with a Shotgun''.<ref name="Hobo"/> The trailer, created by [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] filmmakers [[Jason Eisener]], John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's [[South by Southwest]] ''Grindhouse'' trailers contest.<ref name="SSWHobo">{{cite news|last=Adams|first=James|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article747461.ece|title=Two minutes to hell – and glory|work=Globe and Mail|location=Canada|date=March 31, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907073314/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article747461.ece|archivedate=September 7, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the trailer, David Brunt plays a [[vagabond (person)|vagabond]] with a 20-gauge [[shotgun]] (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a [[vigilante]].

==History and development==
[[File:Dragstrip Girl Rock All Night double feature poster.jpg|left|thumb|The poster for a double feature consisting of the films ''Dragstrip Girl'' and ''[[Rock All Night]]'' sparked the idea for ''Grindhouse''.]]
The idea for ''Grindhouse'' came to [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]] when Tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house, complete with trailers before and in between the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films ''Dragstrip Girl'' and ''[[Rock All Night]].''<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news|last=Hiscock|first=John|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3664742/Quentin-Tarantino-Im-proud-of-my-flop.html|title=Quentin Tarantino: I'm proud of my flop|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 27, 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}</ref> Rodriguez asked Tarantino, "I always wanted to do a double feature. Hey, why don't you direct one and I'll do the other?" Tarantino quickly replied, "And we've got to call it ''Grindhouse''!"<ref name="Bloodbath">{{Cite news|last=Nashawaty|first=Chris|title=Bloodbath and Beyond|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 30, 2007|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015706,00.html|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}</ref>

The film's name originates from the American term for theaters that played "all the [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] genres: [[Kung fu film|kung fu]], [[horror film|horror]], [[Giallo]], [[sexploitation]], the 'good old boy' [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] car-chase movies, [[blaxploitation]], [[spaghetti Western]]s—all those risible genres that were released in the 70s."<ref name="Stone">{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Gavin|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers|title=Online Exclusive: Horror Film Directors Dish About 'Grindhouse' Trailers|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501084049/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers |archivedate = May 1, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> According to Rodriguez, "The posters were much better than the movies, but we're actually making something that lives up to the posters."<ref name="Wizard">{{cite news|last=Cotton|first=Mike|url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |title=House Party|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 4, 2007|work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Universe]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040830/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |archivedate = December 11, 2007}}</ref>

Rodriguez first came up with the idea for ''Planet Terror'' during the production of ''[[The Faculty]]'': "I remember telling [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Josh Hartnett]], all these young actors, that [[zombie]] movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [a script] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [movie] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for ''Grindhouse.''<ref name="Wizard"/>

As ''Planet Terror'' took shape, Tarantino developed the story for ''Death Proof'', based on his fascination for the way [[stunt man|stuntmen]] would "death-proof" their cars. As long as they were driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a [[slasher film]] featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his "death-proof" car.<ref name="Wizard"/> Tarantino remembers, "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of [[Women in prison films|women-in-prison films]], there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you."<ref name="Stone"/>

According to Rodriguez, "[Tarantino] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started to tell me the story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it ''Death Proof.''' I helped title the movie, but that's it."<ref name="Wizard"/> Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, "[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in ''[[Terminator 2]]''. And ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action."<ref name="Stone"/>

==Production==

===Direction===
According to actress [[Marley Shelton]], "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, at least ''Planet Terror''. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on ''Planet Terror'' and vice versa for ''Death Proof''. So it's really both of their brainchild."<ref name="Fangoria-Shelton">{{cite news|last=Spelling|first=Ian|url=http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=4019 |title=Doctor in the Grindhouse|accessdate=May 11, 2009|work=[[Fangoria]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224030717/http://www.fangoria.com/fearful_feature.php?id=4019 |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}</ref> Tarantino has stated, "I can't imagine doing ''Grindhouse'' with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

===Casting===
Many of the cast members had previously worked with both directors. Before appearing in ''Grindhouse'', Marley Shelton had auditioned for ''[[The Faculty]]'', but Rodriguez chose not to cast her. She was eventually cast in the role of a customer in the opening sequence of ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.<ref name="Fangoria-Shelton"/> [[Bruce Willis]] had appeared in both Tarantino's ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' and Rodriguez's ''Sin City'', in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment Tarantino directed for the [[anthology film]] ''[[Four Rooms]]''. [[Tom Savini]] had previously acted in ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]'', which was written by Tarantino and directed by Rodriguez. [[Michael Parks]] reprises the role of [[Earl McGraw]] in ''Planet Terror'' and ''Death Proof''. Parks first portrayed the role in ''From Dusk Till Dawn''. His son, James, appears in ''Death Proof'' as [[Edgar McGraw]], a character that first appeared in ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money]]''. The first time the two characters appeared together was in Tarantino's ''[[Kill Bill]]''. Tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of ''Grindhouse'', and director [[Eli Roth]], who contributed the fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' and whose film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' was produced by Tarantino, has a cameo in ''Death Proof''.

Tarantino attempted to cast both [[Kal Penn]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061121kalpenngrindhouse|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070722151341/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061121kalpenngrindhouse|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2007|title=Did You Know: Kal Penn was cast in Tarantino's ''Grindhouse''?|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=Slash Film}}</ref> and [[Sylvester Stallone]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061204stallonegrindhouse|title=Tarantino wanted Stallone for ''Grindhouse''|accessdate=May 12, 2009|publisher=Slash Film}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> in ''Death Proof'', but both were unable to work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he decided to cast [[Kurt Russell]] as the killer stunt driver because "for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Dreamer (2005 film)|Dreamer]]'',' or 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'',' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?"<ref name="Bloodbath"/>

Rodriguez later revealed that he cast [[Rose McGowan]] as Cherry Darling in response to McGowan's blacklisting from [[The Weinstein Company|Weinstein]] productions following [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s alleged sexual assault of her.<ref name= "rmcgowan">{{cite news |last=Rife |first=Katie |url= https://www.avclub.com/robert-rodriguez-says-rose-mcgowans-role-in-grindhouse-1819921710 |title=Robert Rodriguez says Rose McGowan’s role in Grindhouse was a "fuck you" to Harvey Weinstein |work=[[The A. V. Club]] |date=October 27, 2017 |accessdate=}}</ref>

===Cinematography===
Rodriguez and Tarantino each acted as [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] on their segments. Although Rodriguez had previously worked as the cinematographer on six of his own feature films, ''Death Proof'' marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for [[Rob Zombie]]'s fake trailer ''Werewolf Women of the SS'' was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked with on ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''. The director of photography for Eli Roth's fake trailer ''Thanksgiving'' was Milan Chadima, whom Roth had previously worked with on ''Hostel''.

===Special effects===
[[File:Grind07 Grindhouse.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The intentionally "aged" look of the film, as seen in the trailer ''Machete''.]]
Though set in the modern day, the film uses various unconventional techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in ''Planet Terror'', five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.<ref name="VFX">{{cite news|last=Bielik|first=Alain|publisher=VFX World|title=Grindhouse: Pistol-Packing VFX|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3235|date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref>

''Planet Terror'' makes heavy use of digital effects throughout the film. Perhaps the most notable effect is Cherry's ([[Rose McGowan]]) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an [[M16 rifle]]. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.<ref name="VFX"/>

===Editing===
During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting "missing reels" into the film. "[Quentin] was about to show an Italian crime movie with [[Oliver Reed]]," Rodriguez recalls, "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway."<ref name="Wizard"/>

On the editing of ''Death Proof'', Tarantino stated "There is half-an-hour's difference between my ''Death Proof'' and what is playing in ''Grindhouse''. [...] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked."<ref name="Telegraph"/> An extended, 127-minute version of ''Death Proof'' was screened in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|60th Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Telegraph"/><ref name="Cannes">{{cite news|last=Mackenzie|first=James|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSN1925328520070419|title=Director Tarantino in competition in Cannes|agency=Reuters  |date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name="Cannes archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013 |title=Death Proof|publisher=Cannes Film Festival|accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204134/http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref> Tarantino is quoted as saying "It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see ''Death Proof'' unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees ''Death Proof'' by itself, including me."<ref name="Telegraph"/>

''Grindhouse'' is rated [[PG-Rating|R]] in the United States for "strong graphic bloody violence and gore, [[Profanity|pervasive language]], some [[Sexual content|sexuality]], [[Nudity in film|nudity]], and [[Recreational drug use|drug use]]". On March 15, 2007, ''[[The New York Post]]'' reported that the film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating.<ref name="Rating">{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Johnson|author2=Froelich, Paula |author3=Hoffmann, Bill |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/03152007/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm|title=Page Six: Rating Woes for 'Grindhouse'|accessdate=May 11, 2009|date=March 15, 2007 |work=The New York Post}}</ref> Shortly after, the film officially received an R-rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].

===Soundtrack influences===

The music for ''Planet Terror'' was composed by Rodriguez.

The opening weekend box office total stood below not only the second weekends of ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' and ''[[Meet the Robinsons]]'', but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the poorly reviewed ''[[Are We Done Yet?]]''. In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that ''Grindhouse'' "suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' and ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'' among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny."<ref name="boxoffice"/> Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's ''[[Kill Bill]]'' saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. "Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back-to-back $60&nbsp;million grosses?" he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1Y1-105055141.html|registration=yes|title='Blades' Stays on Top With $23&nbsp;Million|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 8, 2007|agency=Associated Press  }}</ref> The film's length—running more than three hours—also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day.

Quentin Tarantino was quoted as saying about the film's box office results, "It was disappointing, yeah. But the movie worked with the audience. [...] People who saw it loved it and applauded. [...] I'm proud of my flop."<ref name="Telegraph"/> [[Harvey Weinstein]] said that he was so "incredibly disappointed" with the film's opening weekend that he was considering re-releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the "missing" scenes.<ref>{{cite news|last=Finke|first=Nikki|url=http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/what-went-so-wrong-with-grindhouse|title=Harvey Very Disappointed; May Re-Release 'Grindhouse' As 2 Pics|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 9, 2007|publisher=Deadline Hollywood Daily}}</ref> The film altogether earned $25,422,088 in ticket sales.<ref name="mojo" >{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=grindhouse.htm|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Grindhouse'' was embraced by critics; review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 83% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 191&nbsp;reviews, with an average score of 7.4/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Grindhouse'' delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080526082053/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grindhouse |archivedate = May 26, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> At the website [[Metacritic]], which utilizes a [[standard score|normalized]] rating system, the film earned a favorable rating of 77/100 based on 36&nbsp;reviews by mainstream critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/grindhouse?q=Grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=September 27, 2009|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film a "B+" rating, praising it as a "crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films" that "will leave you laughing, gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass."<ref>{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20033672,00.html|title=Grindhouse (2007)|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 4, 2007|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film a positive review, commenting that "by stooping low without selling out, this babes-and-bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again."<ref>{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Travers|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14022227/review/14022289/grindhouse|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=April 3, 2007|work=Rolling Stone|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080714132553/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/14022227/review/14022289/grindhouse |archivedate = July 14, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Critic [[James Berardinelli]] also enjoyed the film but was not as positive as other critics.

In reaction to the possibility of a split in a foreign release, Tarantino stated "Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is, they don't even have the double feature tradition.

''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'' were released separately on [[DVD]] in the United States. The trailers were omitted from ''Death Proof'', with the exception of ''Machete'' which was from ''Planet Terror''. ''Death Proof'' was released on September 18, 2007, with ''Planet Terror'' following on October 16, 2007.

A two-disc Blu-ray "Special Edition" of ''Grindhouse'' was released on October 5, 2010 in the US by [[Vivendi Entertainment]] and has exclusive bonus features.<ref name="Blu-ray">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/44706/grindhouse/|title=Grindhouse|publisher=DVD Talk|date=2010-10-05}}</ref> This release marks the first time that US viewers can view the full ''Grindhouse'' "Double Feature Presentation" experience at home as it was originally released in theaters. The first disc of the 2-disc set contains ''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'', along with the faux trailers, including the "trailer" for ''Machete''. The theatrical cut was released on DVD in Canada from [[Alliance Atlantis]]. All of the extras from the previous individual DVD releases were included, however none of the extras from the Special Edition Blu-ray were included.

[[Bill Moseley]] stated at FanExpo on August 27, 2010 that the Blu-ray would also include a 5-minute version of ''Werewolf Women of the SS''.

==Adaptations of the fake trailers==
{{See also|Machete (2010 film)|l1=Machete|Hobo with a Shotgun|Machete Kills}}

In 2010, Rodriguez wrote and co-directed a feature-length adaptation of his fake trailer, ''Machete''. Many of the original actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it.<ref name="Sciretta">{{cite news|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Rodriguez to film Machete Movie during ''Sin City 2''|publisher=Slash Film|date=March 26, 2007|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez-to-film-machete-movie-during-sin-city-2|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}</ref> ''Machete'' screened September 1 at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3, 2010.

''Machete'' turned out to be more of a success at the box office than ''Grindhouse'', grossing $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: ''Machete Kills'' and ''Machete Kills Again''. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.

The director of a trailer that played in some theaters in the United States and Canada (mainly the latter), ''Hobo with a Shotgun'', [[Jason Eisener]], also made a feature-length adaptation of it. [[Rutger Hauer]] replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character, though Brunt does make a cameo as a corrupt cop.

These two adaptations received mainly positive reviews, with the general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although ''Hobo with a Shotgun'' was not as big a box office success in the U.S. as it was in Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.

Many of the other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films, including Edgar Wright and Eli Roth.

Both Rodriguez and Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a [[sequel]] to ''Grindhouse''.<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Sciretta |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061218grindhousesequel |title=Rodriguez talks Grindhouse Sequel |accessdate=May 12, 2009 |date=December 18, 2006 |work=Slash Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713202127/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20061218grindhousesequel |archivedate=July 13, 2009 }}</ref> Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an "old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others" for his segment.<ref>{{cite news|first=Peter|last=Sciretta|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/29/tarantino-plans-kung-fu-grindhouse-sequel|title=Tarantino Plans Kung Fu Grindhouse Sequel|accessdate=May 12, 2009|date=March 29, 2007|publisher=Slash Film}}</ref> It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand ''Don't'' into a feature film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=412779|title=Edgar Wright's "Don't" Trailer Could Be "Grindhouse 2" |accessdate=May 12, 2009|first=Jen|last=Yamato|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date=April 7, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527085504/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=412779 |archivedate = May 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing ''Don't'' with ''Thanksgiving'' for a ''Grindhouse'' sequel. Roth is quoted as saying "We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're still trying to figure out ''Grindhouse 1'' before we think about ''Grindhouse 2'', but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=418358|title=Roth Wants Full Length "Thanksgiving" for "Grindhouse 3" |accessdate=May 12, 2009|author=RT-News|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|date=May 4, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605234500/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=418358|archivedate=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref>

[[Electra and Elise Avellan]], Rodriguez's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films, originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both ''Machete'' and ''The Babysitter Twins'', but the latter concept did not materialize with the former's release.<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18089 'Crazy Babysitter Twins' Return to the Big Screen...

A third feature-length film based on the trailers, the Robert Rodriguez-directed ''[[Machete Kills]]'', was released at the end of 2013.
