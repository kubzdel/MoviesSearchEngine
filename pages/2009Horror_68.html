==Plot==
The plot opens with water over flowing from the [[Thiruvottiyur]] [[Chennai|Blue Star Apartment]] in [[Chennai]], and in the block '''E''', which is seen by the apartment watchman. When he goes to the block to stop water, he witnesses a young woman Ramya ([[Sindhu Menon]]), who had drowned in the water and died. Eventually the investigation of the death is taking place which is done by Assistant Commissioner of Police Vasudevan IPS ([[Aadhi Pinisetty|Aadhi]]), who is an honest and upright police officer, and also Ramya's former lover Although circumstantial evidence claims it as a suicide, Vasu doubts that it isn't, and starts to investigate it in another angle.

Ramya was known to be in an illegal affair with an unknown person, and his frequent visit to her flat is confirmed by the neighbors in the apartment during the investigation. But Vasu is not convinced and he is sure that there is someone behind Ramya’s death and names him Mr. X. He also remembers his days of love during their college time. Vasu is denied of marriage with Ramya by her father Shriraman (Rajashekar), as he is not willing to give hands of his daughter to Vasu, who is ambitious about becoming a police officer. But true reason is Vasu-Ramya’s love is not accepted by her father. When Vasu asks her to marry without the consent of her father, she does not accept and both part away. Ramya in turn marries a rich groom named Bala ([[Nandha Durairaj|Nandha]]), a businessman. From then on the relationship is entirely cut between Vasu and Ramya. Vasu then becomes a police officer.

Meanwhile, some [[Creepiness|Eerie]] events and [[Supernatural]] mishaps begin to take place in the Blue Star apartment. Kalyani Subramanyam ([[Lakshmi Ramakrishnan]]), who resides in the flat opposite to Ramya’s, dies by [[electric shock]]. A retired colonel and ex-army Thiyagarajan (Boys Rajan) on his travel to [[Pondicherry]] dies by the piercing of an umbrella tip in his neck and also the watchman of the flat. Vasu could relate the deaths with Ramya and he doesn't find how, but finds that the killer must have used [[Water]] ([[H2O]]) to kill them. He appoints a few assistants to live in the flat and inform him if there is any suspected person comes there. The assistants point out a young man ([[Krishna (TV Actor)|Krishna]]) who came there to meet his girlfriend Deepa, and chases him and also informs Vasu. Vasu identifies him as Mr. X and follows him to [[Udayam Theatre]], but before he tries to catch him, he sees the ‘X’ dashing himself in the restroom mirror and X dies in the theatre itself. Vasu also sees human footprints walking on the water and understands that it must be a [[Spirit|Dead Spirit]] ([[Ghost]]) seeking its revenge from them.

Subtle symbols keep appearing to Vasu and he begins to receive premonitions of the killings about to take place. The red color and water when appearing together are premonitions and signals to Vasu that a murder is about to take place. Vasu is not able to convince his superiors about the deaths. He investigates in the angle of life after death, and finds that a life can contact this world in any medium after the death. It may be also through water. Vasu now understands that Ramya's spirit kills everyone. One night, when Divya ([[Saranya Mohan]]), Ramya's sister, visits Vasu in his house to console him for Ramya's death, the latter's spirit possesses her body and reveals the truth of her life after their separation to Vasu.

Ramya married Bala and lived happily with him just for a short time. Bala was a person who disliked anything secondhand in his life. He could not digest his wife’s past relation with her lover Vasu, and hence started to torture her. Ramya’s maidservant complained of Thiyagarajan in another flat, who was sexually harassing her. Ramya warned the master if he would have repeated this she would inform it to his wife. Ramya advised a girl to stop having a boyfriend as it would spoil her life, and this earned her the dislike of that girl. Ramya’s opposite apartment woman Kalyani wanted the flat where Ramya lived, for her daughter. The boyfriend created an impression that he had came to visit Ramya to the woman in the opposite flat. She has spinned a false story against Ramya, and the master also confirmed it to Bala for taking revenge on her. Therefore, Bala killed Ramya and drowned her in water to make it look like a suicide. Hence the beginning of the movie's plot with confusions among Vasu and other police officers for her death.

Hence Ramya's soul killed Kalyani by electric shock, Thiyagarajan by the umbrella tip, and the watchman who supported the false statement against Ramya, Mr. X by dashing him in the mirror and now, she Mr. X's lover and makes her mentally unstable. Vasu warns Bala that he will soon catch him with evidence. Bala’s friend Vicky alias Vignesh ([[Srinath (actor)|Srinath]]) misguides him right from the beginning about the women tendency of varieties and also against Ramya. He is killed by Bala himself as he threatened to reveal the truth about the murder. Bala is confident that he can be caught only if he himself admits the crime. Bala kidnaps Divya, and Vasu comes to save her. At the fight Bala gains the upper hand and hits Vasu on his head and stabs Vasu in his stomach, leading the former to lose power and consciousness. So Ramya's ghost possesses Vasu and gives him the upper hand to knock out Bala. Vasu succeeds in saving Divya and Ramya's spirit leaves him. The very next day, Bala suddenly confesses for the murder of his wife. Hence Vasu gets a chance to prove him as the murderer. Actually, Ramya had possessed him and made him speak the truth. After the press conference, while Bala is being taken to court, the sky's color appears bizarre and it begins to rain and petrol is shown to be leaking from the van in which he is being taken, and Vasu sees a red umbrella with water dripping from it. Then it is understood that Ramya's ghost won't spare Bala and would kill him soon.

==Critical reception==
''Rediff'' wrote "Debutant director Arivazhagan, who has written and directed the film, has turned out a horror/suspense film that strives to score points on logic, novelty and raciness. The best part is that he actually makes you cling to the edge of the seat most of the time. No mean feat, considering the limitations on mainstream Tamil cinema."<ref>http://movies.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/11/review-eeram.htm</ref> ''Behindwoods'' wrote " Although paranormal subjects are not something new, the narrative style, technical wizardry and the brilliant camera work give Eeram, the real eerie experience."<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-reviews/reviews-2/eeram.html</ref> ''The Hindu'' wrote "Arivazhagan must have polished his screenplay over and over again to come up with such a lucid narrative that strongly impacts the viewer. Only wish the attempt doesn’t prove to be a flash in the pan. Because Eeram shows that this young director is worth looking out for."<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-cinemaplus/not-a-damp-squib-eeram/article3021917.ece</ref>
