==Plot==
Emily ([[Leisha Hailey]]) and Nate Weaver ([[Gale Harold]]) are a happily married couple living in [[New York City]]. Nate is a recognized artist, Emily a fashion designer, and the two are expecting their first child. Emily suffers a terrible [[miscarriage]] during a dinner party and she is informed that the scarring left on her womb means she will never be able to conceive again.

To give them both a fresh start, Nate and Emily move out into the countryside to Nate's family home, which has been uninhabited for some time. At first enchanted by it, Emily is horrified when a skeleton is discovered on the property, but it is obvious that the body is very old, so no danger can be attached to the house. After Emily discovers an old trunk filled with old baby things in the cellar, she pays a visit to the local Historical Society and is told that the house has a past she and Nate were unaware of. Several suspicious deaths have occurred at the property in the 18th and 19th century, and Nate's aunt had vanished without a trace when the house was new.

Nate grows distant and cold towards Emily as he starts painting again, acting strangely. Tense and isolated, Emily starts to see visions of a woman covered with blood, and faints. After seeing the doctor, who thinks she is suffering from trauma, she gets a phone call to tell her that she is actually pregnant. Ordered to spend the bulk of her pregnancy in bed resting due to the high risk of miscarriage, Emily starts to get bored and frustrated by Nate, who is working longer and longer hours and seems uninterested in her or the coming baby. Emily's visions continue; she organizes a party for her city friends to rid herself of the loneliness. At the party, she believes that Nate's agent is having an affair with him. Later, the agent somehow falls through the window of Emily's studio and is hospitalized. Nate thinks Emily may have pushed her as he saw her walk away from the window after the woman fell.

When Nate is informed that his agent has died, he storms out angrily. Emily reads through a folder of press cuttings left by the Historical Society and discovers that all the women who died at the house were killed by their husbands. Every woman had been pregnant at the time; supposedly, the house "changed" their husbands and turned them evil. Emily has another vision of the dead woman and believes that Nate is coming back to kill her. She calls her best friend, who tells her that she will come and pick her up.

Terrified, Emily hides in her bedroom with a knife when she hears Nate come back into the house. She tries to stab him with the knife but instead stabs her friend—who had driven back with Nate. Emily climbs up onto the roof to save herself. She believes she is fighting one of the ghosts of the house; they fall from the roof and she stabs him repeatedly. After killing him, Emily realizes she has actually killed Nate.

At the mental hospital, a scan reveals that [[False pregnancy|Emily is not pregnant although she believes she is]]. The doctor's phone call, Nate acting strange, and the ghostly visions were all in her head: symptoms of [[psychosis]]. Emily is left in a padded room, rocking her imaginary child in her arms.

==Production==
While creating the film Giersch and Anderson were inspired films such as ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'', ''[[The Reincarnation of Peter Proud]]'', ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'', and ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''.<ref name=STYD>{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: Gierasch & Anderson Talk Fertile Ground|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/17873-exclusive-gierasch-anderson-talk-fertile-ground/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> The two also noted that while this was their second film for ''[[After Dark Films]]'', their previous work had already been completed prior to it being picked up by ''After Dark'' while ''Fertile Ground'' had not yet been filmed and as such, ''After Dark'' had more input on its production.<ref name=BD>{{cite web|last=Eggersten|first=Chris|title=8 Questions to Die For: ‘Fertile Ground’ Director Adam Gierasch|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/23197/8-questions-to-die-for-fertile-ground-director-adam-gierasch/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> Anderson drew upon some of her own experiences while writing the character of Emily and utilized an image she saw in a dream along with a few articles she had read previously.<ref name=STYD /> Gierasch noted that the film was "a huge departure for [them]", as it was the first film that they had made that had more dramatic elements in it as opposed to "blood and demons and arms being chopped off".<ref name=STYD /> They cast [[Leisha Hailey]] as Emily after she "walked into the room and started reading" at a casting session, as they felt that she captured the character perfectly in the audition.<ref name=STYD /> Filming took place in [[Iowa]] and was mostly uneventful until a nearby farm harvested their [[soy bean]] crop, which caused an enormous swarm of stinging insects to descend on the house and sting Hailey.<ref name=STYD />

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Fertile Ground'' has been mixed and ''[[DVD Verdict]]'' commented that it was "a little slow, but the performances are good, there's a bit of blood, and I enjoyed the plot."<ref>{{cite web|last=Loomis|first=Daryl|title=Fertile Ground (review)|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/fertileground.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> ''[[Fearnet]]'' panned the film and wrote "not only "meh, forgettable," but it's also a tiresome thriller that will evaporate from your short-term memory in less time than in takes to watch. Aside from a few fine acting performances, and Gierasch's greatly improved skill at setting a creepy stage, there's virtually nothing here that's new, noteworthy, or indicative of a duo that's already made about a dozen films."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=FEARNET Movie Review - Fertile Ground|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-fertile-ground|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also criticized the film, which they felt was disappointing in comparison to Gierasch and Anderson's 2008 film ''[[Autopsy (2008 film)|Autopsy]]''<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Review: ‘Fertile Ground’|url=https://variety.com/2011/film/reviews/fertile-ground-1117944329/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' commented that the film "does have its moments" but that the script was an "uninspired, dull mess".<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaffer|first=R.L.|title=Fertile Ground DVD Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/27/fertile-ground-dvd-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' gave a more favorable review, stating that although ''Fertile Ground'' was overly similar to previous films with similar plot lines, it was overall a "jarring ghost story with real life terrors of pregnancy layered in".<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR: New horrors THE WILD HUNT!

This is not quite a haunted house classic, but still recommended."<ref>{{cite web|last=Biltz|first=Jeremy|title=Fertile Ground (review)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/48454/fertile-ground/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
