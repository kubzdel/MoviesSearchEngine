== First film ==
The first chapter of the series is a mockumentary about a [[snuff film]] shot, mainly consisting in a confrontation between the director of the snuff (played by the same Shane Ryan) and his 13 years old victim (Michiko Jimenez). According to Ryan, it was filmed in one weekend.<ref>{{cite news|last=Doug Brunell|title=Excess Hollywood: The Art Of Snuff — The Shane Ryan Interview Part One|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/1673/|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=[[Film Threat]]|date=January 12, 2006}}</ref> The film received mixed reviews. According to the book ''From the Arthouse to the Grindhouse'', the film is "a postmodern take on the transgressive reality film, using the genre's format as a position from which to critique it".<ref>{{cite book|last=John Cline, Robert G.

== Sequels ==
The other chapters of the film reprise the scheme of the first film, with just two actors (the snuff director and the victim) on scene. About the second film, according to the ''[[Film Threat]]'' review, "Ryan has, once again, created something bound to raise eyebrows and the ire of morality police everywhere. He makes no apologies for it, and he does it so well that if you go into the film with an open mind you can’t help but be impressed by how good a job he’s done."<ref name="SNUFF VERSION">{{cite news|title=AMATEUR PORN STAR KILLER 2: THE SNUFF VERSION (DVD)|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/10859/|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=[[Film Threat]]|date=May 13, 2008}}</ref>

The final chapter of the film features the real pornstar Regan Reese as main actress. It was filmed in [[3D film|3D]]. While the previous two films were shot in motel rooms, this was set in the front seat of a [[SUV]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Richard Scheib|title=Amateur Porn Star Killer 3: The Final Chapter (film review)|url=http://moria.co.nz/horror/amateur-porn-star-killer-3-the-final-chapter-2009.htm|accessdate=22 October 2013|newspaper=Moria}}</ref>
