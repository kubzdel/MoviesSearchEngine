==Reception==
*"smalltown ghost story that's more interesting for its female cast and its curious structure than anything else. In fact, it's the most interesting part of the film, detailing the smalltown characters, the changing lives of its women and shifting family ties. The ghostly section of the film, with guilty parties dropping dead like flies, is relatively brief and not particularly scary "----Derek Elley, ''Film Business Asia''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/blood-stained-shoes|title=Review: Blood Stained Shoes|publisher=[[Film Business Asia]]|date=18 May 2012|archivedate=24 October 2015|last=Elley|first=Derek|authorlink=Derek Elley|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024112559/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/blood-stained-shoes}}</ref>
