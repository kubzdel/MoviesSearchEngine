'''''Storm Warning''''' is a 2007 Australian [[horror film]] directed by [[Jamie Blanks]] and starring [[Nadia Farès]] and [[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]].

==Plot==
Australian lawyer Rob and his French artist wife Pia spend the day sailing along coastal marshland. While sailing around a [[headland]], they become lost. At nightfall, they dock their boat and plan to relocate their car on foot. In the marsh, they come across a man being beaten by an unseen assailant next to a parked truck on a desolate road. They flee, and stumble upon a decrepit farmhouse just as a torrential rainstorm begins. In a shed on the property, Rob uncovers a large amount of [[marijuana]] growing.

Rob and Pia are interrupted when the deranged, [[redneck]] owners of the home—Brett, his brother Jimmy, and their father Poppy—return. The brothers, who perceive Rob and Pia as upper-class [[yuppie]]s, offer them a shower during which they steal their wetsuits. When Rob asks for them back, they begin to insult them. At the dinner table, they taunt Rob for driving a [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]], and sexually harass Pia. Their intimidation tactics quickly escalate, as Brett threatens to [[castration|castrate]] Rob unless Pia kills a [[Wallaby#Etymology and terminology|joey]], which she reluctantly does. Rob and Pia attempt to flee from the house, and stumble upon the corpse of the man they saw being beaten earlier. Rob breaks his leg in the melee, and he and Pia are captured and locked in a barn. 

They manage to fashion a [[booby trap]] with hooks and other sharp objects found inside the barn, which they dispatch on Brett when he re-enters; the hooks lodge in his face and lift him into the air, after which Pia kills him by beating his head in. Jimmy enters the barn looking for Brett before forcing Pia outside at gunpoint. He brings her into the house and sends her upstairs to Poppy to let him rape her. When Poppy attempts to penetrate her, Pia drives a broken liquor bottle into his groin. She flees into a crawlspace, where she falls through the floor, landing a downstairs room. Jimmy pursues her with a rifle to the barn, where she and Rob hide. When Jimmy enters the barn, he finds Brett's body, during which Rob and Pia manage to steal his rifle before locking him inside.

Rob and Pia enter the house, where Poppy is still upstairs tending to his wound in the bathroom. Pia locates the keys to the brothers' truck, and she and Rob attempt to drive away. While trying to start the truck, Poppy pursues them with a knife, but the blood from his wound attracts his [[Rottweiler]], who [[Disembowlment|eviscerates]] him. Jimmy attempts to chase the truck with an [[airboat]] stored inside the barn, but Pia crashes into him, throwing him into the propeller which shreds his body to pieces. The couple then drive away to safety.

==Reception==

Jason Buchanan from [[Allmovie]] gave the film a negative review, stating that the film didn't bring anything new to the genre and criticized the film's lack of originality.<ref name="buchananrev">{{cite web|last1=Buchanan|first1=Jason|title=Storm Warning (2007) - Jamie Blanks|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/storm-warning-v383265/review|website=Allmovie.com|publisher=Jason Buchanan|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> 
Sean DeArmond from ''Horror News.net'' gave the film a mixed review, complimenting the film's acting, but criticized the film's runtime, lack of likable lead characters, and overuse of cloud shots. In his review, DeArmond concluded, "the movie does what it sets out to do. The content is cringe worthy and often unnerving, but it never drops the ball it has chosen to carry. If it sounds like your thing, have at it. We, however, are going to put in a light comedy to decompress."<ref name="DeArmond12">{{cite web|last1=DeArmond|first1=Sean|title=Film Review: Storm Warning (2007)|url=http://horrornews.net/37591/film-review-storm-warning-2007/|website=HorrorNews.net|publisher=Sean DeArmond|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>
