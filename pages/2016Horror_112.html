The film is a [[prequel]] to the 2014 film ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]'' and stars [[Elizabeth Reaser]], [[Annalise Basso]], [[Lulu Wilson]], [[Parker Mack]], and [[Henry Thomas]]. The film's plot focuses on a widow and her family adding a Ouija board to their phony seance business where, unbeknownst to them, they invite a spirit that possesses the youngest daughter.

The film was released on October 21, 2016, by [[Universal Pictures]], grossing over $81 million. It received positive reviews, with many praising it as a significant improvement over its predecessor.

== Plot ==
<!-- NOTE: A plot summary usually serves as an overview of the film's events. Per WP:FILMPLOT, a plot summary is recommended to be 400-700 words. -->
In 1967 <!-- WARNING! the film is set in 1967 and do not added it to 1965--> [[Los Angeles]], a widow named Alice Zander works out of her suburban home as a spiritual medium, accompanied by her daughters, 15-year-old Paulina "Lina" and 9-year old Doris. The family is still reeling over the recent death of Roger, Alice's husband and the kids' father. At Lina's suggestion, Alice incorporates a [[Ouija board]] into her readings. While trying out the board, she unknowingly contacts a spirit named Marcus that begins to possess Doris. 

Alice receives a notice that the bank intends to foreclose on their home. Doris contacts the board for help, believing she is communicating with her dead father. The spirit leads her to a secret compartment behind the basement wall containing a pouch of cash. When she gives the money to her mother, the family has a Ouija session, believing they can contact Roger. When the board answers a question only Roger would know the answer to, a thrilled Alice begins believing that they are in contact with her dead husband.

Soon, Doris becomes possessed by a shadowy spirit. Lina, who is becoming disturbed by the changes in her sister, finds papers written by Doris in fluent [[Polish language|Polish]], a language she does not know, and brings them to Father Tom to translate. Troubled, Father Tom visits them for a Ouija session under the pretense of contacting his dead wife Gloria. Although the session appears to be successful, Father Tom later explains to Alice and Lina that Doris did not contact Gloria. Instead, for every question he asked, she read his thoughts and repeated the answers he was thinking in his mind. He reveals that the pages are entries written by a Polish immigrant named Marcus, who was taken captive during [[World War II]] by a sadistic doctor who conducted experiments on him and other captives inside the house's basement. These spirits knew answers that only Roger would know because they have been watching the family since the day they moved in.

Meanwhile, Doris kills Lina's boyfriend Mikey. When they find the body, Father Tom, Alice, and Lina burn the Ouija board in the furnace. Father Tom finds the secret room where the experiments were conducted, and is possessed by the spirits. He attacks Alice and Lina, but momentarily seizes clarity, only to be killed by Doris. Alice is captured, while Roger's spirit carries an unconscious Lina to her bed. Recalling an earlier moment when her doll's mouth was stitched by her father's spirit "to shut out the voices", she realizes she must sew Doris' mouth shut to quiet the spirits' voices and stop the evil. She fights off the embodied evil spirits to do so but kills Doris in the process, reuniting with her father. The spirits possess Lina and stab Alice. As she dies, Alice sees Roger and Doris together.

Lina is committed in a mental hospital for the suspected murder of her mother. She tells her doctor that she knows she will never be alone again. Later, Lina summons Doris's evil spirit with a make-shift Ouija board. 

In a post-credits scene, 47 years later, a now elderly and still institutionalized Lina receives a visit from someone claiming to be her niece.

== Production ==

Production in Los Angeles commenced in September 2015 and wrapped in October 2015.<ref name="lafilm"/> Although the first film in the Ouija series was a success commercially the critical reception was less than stellar. As a result, Jason Blum wanted to make a film that was significantly different than the original.<ref name="esquireinterview">{{cite web|last=Schager|first=Nick|title=How This Horror Director Is Reinvigorating the Genre By Returning It to Its Roots|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/q-and-a/a49744/mike-flanagan-interview-ouija-origin-of-evil/|website=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|accessdate=February 11, 2017|date=October 19, 2016}}</ref> This appealed to director Mike Flanagan who stated in an interview that he has "allergy to sequels" Blum let Flanagan work on the type of horror film he wanted which was a [[period piece]] that dealt with a family dynamic.<ref name="esquireinterview"/> There was some talk from the beginning about whether or not the film should have any connections at all to the original, but Flanagan himself was opposed to this, and instead opted to make references to the original subtle to welcome new viewers while also entertaining fans of the original.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Connelly|first1=Brendon|title=Mike Flanagan interview: Ouija: Origin Of Evil, Halloween|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/mike-flanagan/44519/mike-flanagan-interview-ouija-origin-of-evil-halloween|website=Den of Geek|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=October 21, 2016|accessdate=February 11, 2017}}</ref>

The 1980 movie ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' was a major influence on the film, with Flanagan screening the film with his director of photography "like ten times" while also watching other classics such as ''[[The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[The Watcher in the Woods]]''. It was then that the pair hit off the idea to film the movie as if it were the 1970s, using only technology that would only have been available in that era.<ref name="esquireinterview"/>

==Unofficial sequels==
Film media distributor Cinedigm has released two unofficial sequels. The film "Charlie, Charlie" was released in 2017 on DVD with the title "[[Ouija 3: The Charlie Charlie Challenge]]" and the 2015 Hong Kong horror film "Are You Here" was released in 2018 on DVD with the title "[[Ouija 4]]". This deceptive marketing was made to fool the public into believing these were sequels to two official [[Blumhouse Productions]] films.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
