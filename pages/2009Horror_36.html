'''''Chaw''''' ({{ko-hhrm|차우||Chau|Ch‘au}}), released in the United States as '''''Chawz''''', is a [[List of South Korean films of 2009|2009 South Korean film]] about a [[mutant]] killer pig wreaking havoc on a small mountain town, and the ragtag team of five who set out to stop the beast. The feature subverts the [[monster movie|monster genre]] into a witty, suspenseful [[black comedy]] mixed with horror, adventure, and a healthy dose of [[camp (style)|camp]].

The Korean title is pronounced "chow", which means "trap" in [[Chungcheong dialect]].

==Plot==
The quiet town of Sammaeri near [[Jirisan|Mount Jiri]] has been crime-free for a decade until now. Bodies of villagers begin turning up, making the village leaders nervous just ahead of an [[organic food]] fair expected to be a financial windfall. Chun Il-man ([[Jang Hang-sun]]), whose granddaughter was one of the victims, is sure that a man-killing [[wild boar|boar]] is behind the crimes. He joins forces with detective Shin ([[Park Hyuk-kwon]]) and Kim Kang-soo ([[Uhm Tae-woong]]), a reassigned cop from [[Seoul]] whose mother has gone missing in the woods. With Byun Soo-ryun ([[Jung Yu-mi (actress born 1983)|Jung Yu-mi]]), a biologist studying wild animals, and glory-seeking hunter Baek Man-bae ([[Yoon Je-moon]]) on the team to fight the giant killer beast, the five start up the mountain to face their enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=2009.7.17 NOW PLAYING|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2907516|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Korea Joongang Daily]]|date=17 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Chaw|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940755?refcatid=31|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=30 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=yna>{{cite web|last=Shin|first=Hae-in|title=Full of wit and humor, monster flick draws laughter rather than chills|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/culturesports/2009/07/09/95/0703000000AEN20090709001500315F.HTML|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Yonhap]]|date=9 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Hyo-won|title=Chaw Explores Omnivore’s Nightmare|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2009/07/141_48183.html|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[The Korea Times]]|date=9 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Kyu Hyun|title=Chaw|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm09.html#chaw|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-11-18}}</ref>

==Production==
Director Shin Jung-won said his film adopted a typical Hollywood [[B movie]] monster narrative to tackle environmental issues, particularly the serious destruction inflicted on Korea's ecology.<ref name=cgipig>{{cite web|last=Yang|first=Sung-jin|title=Korea's new B-movie star: a CGI pig|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090617000109|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=17 June 2009}}</ref> He said Korea had never had a film dealing with real-life killer creatures like ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]'' and ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' and was "intrigued by the idea of a familiar animal attacking and killing humans and wanted to create something out of this unexpectedness. But most of all, I wanted something funny and unique."<ref name=yna />

After filming in Seoul, the production crew and the main actors flew to the United States to shoot [[special effect]]s scenes. The shooting lasted for 40 days in [[San Francisco]]. Misunderstandings in interpreting the nuance of a scene or dialogue sometimes arose between the U.S. special effects team and Korean actors due to different cultural backgrounds, but Uhm said, "after the shooting was over, we formed a strong team spirit, as if we battled together in a war."<ref name=cgipig />

It took three years and {{SK won|3 billion}} to design and realize via [[animatronics]], stuntmen with costumes, and [[computer graphics|CG]] ― provided by the creative team Polygon Entertainment and Stareast Digital Lab led by Hans Uhlig and Erik Jensen ― a mutated, super-sized pig that develops a taste for human flesh.<ref>{{cite web|title=K-FILM REVIEWS: 차우 (Chaw)|url=http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2009/09/k-film-reviews-chaw.php|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Twitch Film]]|date=20 September 2009}}</ref>

After it was well received at the [[Berlin Film Festival#European Film Market|Berlin Film Festival's Film Market]], ''Chaw'' was released in a total of 15 countries, including Germany, Switzerland, India, Singapore, Thailand, the United States, and Japan.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Hannah|title=Make way for a mutant boar with a bad attitude|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2906589|accessdate=2012-11-18|work=[[Korea Joongang Daily]]|date=26 June 2009}}</ref>
