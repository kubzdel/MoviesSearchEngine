==Plot==
A school organization heads off to a Holy Week retreat, led by their religion professor. But before long, they realize they've lost their way due to misdirection and have no choice but to stay the night in a desolate house, with only a mother ([[Lotlot de Leon]]) and her son ([[Nash Aguas]]) living in the house and a mysterious man following them.

The boy has three playmates who become jealous when the boy declines to join them in play, which angers them, and they seek vengeance on the newcomers. Many nights later, the kids transform themselves into their real form and attack the group, killing and disabling them one by one, until only the professor, the mother and her son, and some students remain. The mother dies when a Tiyanak bites her while defending her son.

The professor has the idea of baptizing the Tiyanaks by submersing them on the pool while chanting a prayer for baptism. Many days later, the survivors research what happened to them when the boy contracted fever. When they try to find out what happened, the boy's eyes become fiery and enraged, and his head becomes engulfed in flames.
