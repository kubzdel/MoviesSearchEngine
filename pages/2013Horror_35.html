==Synopsis==
When Milton ([[Milo Cawthorne]]) is caught cooking [[meth]], he is sent to a rehab center where he meets the beautiful Skyler ([[Olivia Tennet]]). He is wildly attracted to her, so much so that they have sex shortly after meeting. Milton also agrees to break out of rehab with her and travel to the woods, where he will make a large amount of meth for an exorbitant sum of money. He is ill-prepared for her psychotic boyfriend Russell ([[Ari Boyland]]), who tells him that he knows about Milton's fling with Skyler. Unbeknownst to Milton, the cabin is set in the middle of a land that has been forever psychically tainted by a massive and bloody Native American war.
