'''''Snakehead Terror''''' is a 2004 science fiction-horror television film.  It is one of two [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] films based on the [[Crofton, Maryland#Crofton pond snakehead fish incident|snakehead fish incident]] in a [[Crofton, Maryland]] pond. The other film is  ''[[Frankenfish]]''. ''[[Swarm of the Snakehead]]'' is an independently produced creature comedy based on the same Crofton incident, and the only one of the three actually filmed in Maryland. Based on real fish called snakeheads.

==Plot==
A small town in Maryland, desperate to recover from hard economic times, is under threat when  the voracious [[Channidae|snakehead]] fish mutate, surviving previous chemical attacks. The fish transform from pests to predators when [[human growth hormone]]s are dumped into the local lake in the hopes of reviving the local fishing industry. Thriving on the hormones, the Snakehead fish grow to monstrous proportions, devouring everything within reach. Capable of moving and eating on land, they are forced to leave the now barren lake in a desperate search for food - animal, vegetable or human. In a race against time, the local Sheriff and biologist Lori Dale, try to save the Sheriff's teenage daughter and her friends, along with the town itself,  from being eaten alive.
