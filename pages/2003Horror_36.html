The nation watched in horror as, one by one, the details of over 30 murders came to light and most of the victims, entombed in the crawl space underneath his house, were unearthed.
John Wayne Gacy had been one of the most infamous killers in the whole country.

==Reception==

On the film review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Gacy'' received a 17% approval rating, based on six reviews, with an average rating of 3.8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gacy/|title=Gacy (film)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> Chuck Wilson of ''[[LA Weekly]]'' found ''Gacy'' to be an "unenlightening" and "unconvincing" film that suffered from "dime-store psychology" and a failure to "convey the subtleties of Gacy’s scheming intellect."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.laweekly.com/film/film_results.php?showid=2329|title = ''Gacy''|last = Wilson|first = Chuck|publisher = [[Internet Archive]]|website = laweekly.com|accessdate = 19 June 2018|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030708224114/http://www.laweekly.com/film/film_results.php?showid=2329|archivedate = 8 July 2003}} </ref> Mike Long of [[DVD Talk]] gave the film a half star out of a possible five, opined that it "offers no suspense, no gore, and no thrills" and concluded, "If nothing else, a film about a serial-killer should offer a glimpse inside the criminal mind. If it can't do that, it could at least be an entertaining [[exploitation film]]. ''Gacy'' is neither of those things and there is absolutely no reason to see this movie."<ref> {{cite web|url = https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/6326/gacy/|title = Gacy|last = Long|first = Mike|publisher = DVD Talk|date = 13 May 2003|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 19 June 2018}} </ref> Reel Film Review's David Nusair commended Mark Holton's performance as Gacy, but lambasted the film itself, which he derided as being an ineptly written and directed "bore" that "completely fails to make any kind of impact."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.reelfilm.com/gacy.htm|title =
