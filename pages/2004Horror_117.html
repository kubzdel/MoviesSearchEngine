Extremes''''' ({{zh|t=三更2|p=Sāngēng 2}}; {{ko-hhrm|쓰리, 몬스터||Sseuli, Monseuteo}}; {{lang-ja|美しい夜、残酷な朝}}; ''Utsukushī Yoru, Zankokuna Asa'') is a 2004 international East Asian [[horror film]] collaboration consisting of three segments by three directors from three countries. It is a [[sequel]] to, and follows the concept of ''[[Three (2002 film)|Three]]'' (2002), this time with more established directors.

Its first film, ''Dumplings'', was expanded into [[Dumplings (film)|a theatrical feature film]].

==Films==
===''Dumplings''===
Aging actress Mrs. Li wants to rejuvenate her youth and beauty to attract the attention of her husband, Li, who has secretly taken a mistress behind her back. She buys dumplings from Aunt Mei, a mysterious seller who claims to be much older than she appears. However, to her disgust, she learns that the dumplings are in fact made from aborted [[fetuses]], which Mei takes from a nearby hospital that has a secret abortion facility, as well as working as an abortion midwife herself. 

Nevertheless, Mrs. Li decides to continue eating the fetus dumplings. One of them, made from a five month old fetus (the 'oldest' of the aborted fetuses thus far), seems to have a positive effect on Mrs. Li's [[libido]], yet it also causes her skin to exhibit a fishy smell. Eventually, Mei has to move out when the authorities are about to capture her. Mrs. Li, now two months pregnant despite being declared infertile earlier, is still desperate for a rejuvenation and chooses to abort her own fetus, presumably to make it into dumplings.

===''Cut''===
A successful film director has to face a night of misery when a man who appeared in five of his films as an extra, captures both him and his wife to play a deadly game. The wife, a pianist, is gagged and trapped in a system of sharp wires at her piano. The director is instructed to strangle a young girl the extra met while on the way, or else the extra will chop off the wife's fingers one by one every five minutes. The extra reveals that he kidnapped the couple because he is jealous that the director is able to be a rich and good man, while he is poor and abusive to his wife and son, the former of whom he murdered before the incident. 

The director tries to buy time by telling stories of his infidelity, though the extra continues to chop the wife's fingers until only one remains on her left hand. The director ultimately decides to kill the young girl by strangling her. he tries, but does not quite succeed in killing her. The young girl's wig comes off and she is revealed to be boy - the extra's son. The extra is only stopped when he slips on a ring the wife was wearing before he chopped off her ring finger, and on the blood pouring from the wife's fingers. The wife then bites and the extra's neck, poushing him into the wires that imprison her, leaving him bleeding to death. Traumatized and delusional, the director, now believing his wife to be the extra's son and vice versa, strangles her to death.

===''Box''===
Kyoko, a 25 years old novelist, frequently experiences nightmares of her past as a circus performer. Back when she was 10 years old, Kyoko worked in a circus with her twin sister, Shoko, and their benefactor, Higata. Kyoko felt that Higata was favoring Shoko over her when he praised her after a performance. When Shoko was training, Kyoko forced and locked her into a box. However, Higata watched the incident and tried to rescue her, only for Kyoko to scar him in the face and then accidentally set the box in flames. Since then, Kyoko is haunted with guilt and wants to apologize to her sister. She is also struck uncannily by her literature publisher, Yoshii, who is a doppelganger of Higata, except that he is more caring to her.

One day, Kyoko follows an invitation to her old circus, only to discover the box containing Shoko's burned remains. She is confronted by Higata, who is distraught after the incident and tells her that both Kyoko and Shoko are important to him, but only as one entity. After luring her into kissing him, he forces her into a plastic sack, fits it into a box, then buries it in the nearby snowy ground. However, it is revealed that the entire event of the film is just another dream of Kyoko, who in reality has been [[Conjoined twins|conjoined]] with Shoko since birth. The sisters exit the house to meet with Higata/Yoshii, both indeed the same person.
