He vows to get her back after she fails to recognise him. Mukundan then remembers his father's teachings and starts learning from the ancient thalliyolas passed from generation to generation. He manages to bring Malu (Rukku) to the manthrakallam. Here he finds out about Rukku's past; a girl from a poor background who loved a person from the Shenoy Mandir. When the three brothers in the Shenoy Mandir got to know of the affair, they killed of Rukku's family and burnt Rukku alive. Her lover, horrifyed at the sight, jumped into the flames and committed suicide. Since then Rukku became a vengeful soul and killed two of the three brothers.
