'''''Drag Me to Hell''''' is a 2009 American [[supernatural horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]]. The plot, written with his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]], focuses on a loan officer, who, because she has to prove to her boss that she can make the "hard decisions", chooses not to extend an elderly woman's mortgage. In retaliation, the woman places a [[curse]] on the loan officer that, after three days of escalating torment, will plunge her into the depths of [[Hell]] to burn for eternity.

Raimi wrote ''Drag Me to Hell'' with his brother, Ivan, prior to working on the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' films]]. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and was released to critical acclaim. It was also a box office success, grossing over $90 million worldwide.  ''Drag Me to Hell'' won the award for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] at the 2009 [[Scream Awards]] and the 2010 [[Saturn Awards]].

==Plot==
In 1969, Pasadena, California, a couple seeks the aid of the [[mediumship|medium]] Shaun San Dena, saying their son has been hearing evil spirits' voices after stealing a silver necklace from a “gypsy wagon”. San Dena aids the family by carrying out a [[seance]], but they were attacked by an unseen force (revealed later to be Lamia) that pulls the boy into [[Hell]]. The medium says she will encounter the force again one day.

In present-day Los Angeles, bank loan officer Christine Brown hopes to be promoted to assistant manager over her co-worker Stu Rubin. Her boss, Jim Jacks, advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions to get a promotion. Christine is visited by an elderly woman, Sylvia Ganush, who asks for a third extension on her mortgage payment. Despite knowing Ganush is on a fixed income, and that she suffers from medical ailments, Christine denies Ganush an extension to prove herself to her boss. Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house and kneels in front of her. Christine becomes frightened of the woman's persistence, desperate pleading as she is helping her to stand up and calls security, who take Ganush away while Ganush blames Christine for "shaming" her and vows to take revenge. Jim compliments Christine on how she handled the situation, and embellishes his positive statements, alluding to a promotion.

When Christine leaves work and gets to the parking garage to drive home, Ganush, hiding in the backseat, attacks Christine in her car. Despite sustaining what should be fatal injuries, Ganush rips a button off Christine's coat and uses it to place a [[curse]] on Christine. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton meet fortune teller Rham Jas, who tells Christine that she is being haunted by a dark spirit, likely the result of a curse. At home, Christine is attacked by the entity and has repulsive nightmares about Ganush. At work the next day, after hallucinating flies buzzing in her stomach and Ganush’s hands in place of Stu’s, Christine snaps at Stu and has a projectile nose bleed that soaks her boss in blood. She runs out of the office, and in the occurring panic, Stu steals a file from Christine's desk.

Christine goes to talk to Ganush for forgiveness in efforts to lift the curse. Ganush’s granddaughter answers the door, skeptical of Christine’s remorse, and Christine finds that Ganush cannot lift the curse, seeing as Ganush has died, and her granddaughter was hosting the funeral/viewing for her in the basement.

Christine returns to Rham Jas, who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object, she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the Lamia (loosely based on the Greek Lamia, a child eating demon), that will torment her for three days before taking her to [[Hell]] for eternity. He suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon. Desperate to stop the attacks, Christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten. At a dinner party, she meets Clay’s parents for the first time,. She is again tormented by the Lamia, plagued with grotesque hallucinations like bugs appearing in a cake she bought for the night, and auditory illusions which cause her to scream abruptly and frighten Clay and his parents.

Christine returns to Rham Jas who says that Shaun San Dena will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $10,000. San Dena prepares a seance to trap the Lamia's spirit in a goat and kill it, and then allows the Lamia to inhabit her body. Rham Jas tries to persuade it not to steal Christine's soul, but it vows never to stop until Christine dies. Christine then places San Dena's hand on the goat, causing the spirit to enter its body. San Dena's assistant, Milos, attempts to kill the goat, but is bitten by the goat and becomes possessed and attacks the members of the seance. San Dena banishes the Lamia from the seance, but dies in the process. Christine thinks the medium has overcome the Lamia, but Rham Jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day. Then, he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift, thereby passing the curse on to that person.

Christine decides to give the envelope to Stu in revenge for his stealing her work, but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic Stu is when he meets up with her. With guidance from Rham Jas, Christine learns that she can give it back to Ganush even though she is dead. Christine digs up Ganush's grave, and after struggling momentarily with the corpse, Christine “formally” gives back the button, and  callously jams the envelope in Ganush’s mouth just in time before dawn, apparently ending the curse.

Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Union Station]] for a weekend trip. She gets a message from her boss telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confessed to stealing her work and was fired. At the station, Christine buys a coat that she has been wanting as a sign of a new beginning. Clay, planning to propose, reveals to Christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car; Christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to Clay when she accidentally dropped it and that the curse was never lifted. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. As Clay looks on, unable to reach Christine, a train barrels towards her, while fiery hands suddenly emerge from the tracks and drag Christine into the fiery pits of [[Hell]]. Clay, holding the button in his hand at the edge of the train platform, with tears rolling down his face, stares at the tracks in utter disbelief and horror.

==Production==

===Background===
The original story for ''Drag Me to Hell'' was written ten years before the film went into production and was written by [[Sam Raimi]] and his brother [[Ivan Raimi]]. The film went into production under the name ''The Curse''.<ref name="prod">{{cite web | title = Drag Me to Hell Production Notes | url = http://www.dragmetohell.net/assets/production/production_notes.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090519202048/http://www.dragmetohell.net/assets/production/production_notes.html | archivedate = May 19, 2009 | work = Drag Me To Hell Official Website | publisher = [[Universal Pictures]] | location = Los Angeles, California | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref> The Raimis wrote the script as a [[morality tale]], desiring to write a story about a character who wants to be a good person, but makes a sinful choice out of greed for her own betterment and pays the price for it.<ref name="festival-cannes">{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Press Conference (8:00) | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10041.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref> The Raimis tried to make the character of Christine the main focal point in the film, and tried to have Christine in almost all the scenes in the film.<ref name="prod" /> Elements of the film's story are drawn from the [[British cinema|British]] [[horror film]] ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (itself an adaptation of [[M.R. James]]' short story "[[Casting the Runes]]") such as the similar-shaped demons and the three-day curse theme in the film.<ref>{{cite web | title = Movie Review: Drag Me to Hell : Mountain Xpress | url = http://www.mountainx.com/movies/review/drag_me_to_hell | first = Ken | last = Hanke | date = 2009-06-03 | work = [[Mountain Xpress]] | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref><ref name="variety" /> The most significant parallel is that both stories involve the passing of a cursed object, which has to be passed to someone else, or its possessor will be devoured by one or more demons. Unlike his past horror films, Raimi wanted the film to be rated PG-13 and not strictly driven by gore, stating, "I didn't want to do exactly the same thing I had done before."<ref name="prod" /><ref name="15cannes">{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Press Conference (15:30) | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10041.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref>

After finishing the script, Raimi desired to make the picture after the first draft of the script was completed, but other projects such as the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' film series]] became a nearly decade-long endeavor, pushing opportunities to continue work on ''Drag Me to Hell'' to late 2007.<ref name="prod" /> Raimi offered director [[Edgar Wright]] to direct ''Drag Me to Hell'' which Wright turned down as he was filming ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' and felt that "If I did it, it would just feel like karaoke."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/latest/305032-hero_worship_sam_raimi|work=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|title=Hero Worship: Sam Raimi|author=Wright, Edgar|authorlink=Edgar Wright|accessdate=July 8, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref> After the previous three ''Spider-Man'' films, Raimi came back to the script of ''Drag Me to Hell'', wanting to make a simpler and lower-budget film.<ref name="CannesInterview">{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Interview | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10040.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}</ref> In 2007, Sam Raimi's friend and [[Film producer|producer]] [[Robert Tapert]] of [[Ghost House Pictures]] had the company sign on to finance the film.<ref name="prod" /> [[Universal Studios]] agreed to distribute domestically.<ref name="prod" />

===Casting===
After completing the script and having the project greenlit, Raimi started casting the film.<ref name="prod" /> [[Ellen Page]] was originally cast for the main role of Christine, but dropped out of the project due to [[Screen Actors Guild#2008–09 Screen Actors Guild labor dispute|SAG strike]]-related scheduling issues.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.movieweb.com/news/NElPVqonXe3xpl | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110611043502/http://www.movieweb.com/news/ellen-page-quits-sam-raimis-drag-me-to-hell | archivedate = June 11, 2011 | title = Ellen Page Quits Sam Raimi's ''Drag Me to Hell'' | date = February 29, 2008 | publisher = MovieWeb | quote = We were racing to start production so that we could accommodate Ellen's schedule. But like so many other productions trying to start before the potential SAG strike date, this one needed more time and we had to push back the start of production.}}</ref> The main role eventually went to Lohman, who didn't enjoy [[horror film]]s, but enjoyed doing the stunts during filming.<ref name="prod" /> Stage actress [[Lorna Raver]] auditioned for the role of Mrs. Ganush. Raver was not aware of the specific nature of her character until being cast, stating that all she had read was "about a little old lady coming into the bank because they're closing down her house. It was only later that I saw the whole script and said, 'Oh my!'"<ref name="prod" /> To prepare for this role, Raver met with a Hungarian dialect coach and asked to have portions of the script translated into Hungarian.<ref name="prod" /> Raimi would later ask Raver to use some of the Hungarian words in the scenes of Ganush's attacking Christine.<ref name="prod" /> [[Dileep Rao]], who plays Rham Jas, made producer [[Grant Curtis]] mildly hesitant in casting him, stating that during his audition "he was a little bit younger than he read in the script. But as we were looking at his reading, Sam said, 'There's no minimum age requirement on wisdom.' Dileep has that wisdom and presence on screen, and that’s what made him right. Once he got on camera, he brought that shoulder for Alison to lean on."<ref name="prod" /> Many of the actors playing secondary characters in ''Drag Me to Hell'' have appeared previously in Raimi's films, including Joanne Baron, Tom Carey, [[Molly Cheek]], Aimee Miles, John Paxton, [[Ted Raimi]], Bill E. Rogers, [[Chelcie Ross]], and [[Octavia Spencer]].<ref name="prod" />

===Filming===
Raimi said he set out to create “a horror film with lots of wild moments and lots of suspense and big shocks that’ll hopefully make audiences jump. But I also wanted to have a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout. I spent the last decade doing ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and you come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help, but it’s refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that, as with most filmmakers, the best way to do it is yourself, with a tight team doing the main jobs."<ref name="PostMag">{{cite web | last = Blair | first = Iain | title = Director's Chair: Sam Raimi Drag me to Hell | url = http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?tier=4&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&sid=&nm=&id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802031958/http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22 | archivedate=August 2, 2009 | work = Post Magazine | date = July 1, 2009 | accessdate  = July 9, 2013}}</ref>

Production for ''Drag Me to Hell'' began on location in [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana, California]].<ref name="prod" /> The production team included director of photography [[Peter Deming]] (''[[Evil Dead II]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Dr.]]''), production designer Steve Saklad (''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''), and visual effects supervisor Bruce Jones. The film was produced by [[Grant Curtis]] and [[Rob Tapert]]. Tapert and Raimi are longtime collaborators, having attended college together in Michigan.<ref name="PostMag" />

===Editing===
''Drag Me to Hell'' was edited by [[Bob Murawski]], who has collaborated with Raimi on several films including the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' series, ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.<ref name="PostMag" />

Raimi has said of working with Murawski on ''Drag Me to Hell'', "He’d come (down to the set) to see how things were going and to let me know if he’d just cut something that wasn’t working the way he’d wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn’t realized I needed. He’s very detail-oriented... So we’re very close collaborators."

Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be "relaxing", adding, "I love it. For me, it's so relaxing, unlike pre-production, which is fraught with anxiety and fear about how we'e going to do things, and production, which is so rushed and a sleepless time and you're just racing to finish every shot and worrying about focus and so on. So post is soothing and I can watch the film come together, so it's a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together. I see new possibilities in post, as Bob puts the film together, sometimes in a way I never imagined..."<ref name="PostMag" />

The film was edited by Murawski on an Avid computer system in a West Los Angeles facility. The color grading was completed at Company 3 with colorist Stephen Nakamura. Nakamura used DaVinci Resolve. It was CO3's first start-to-finish feature in 4K resolution.<ref name="PostMag" />

"For us, post is a very creative time where it's not just about this factory producing the blueprinted product. It's really a very creative, experimental time where we try and take everything that's been written and then shot to the next level," said Raimi.<ref name="PostMag" />

The final sound mix was completed at the Dub Stage in Burbank with mixers Marti Humphrey and Chris Jacobson.<ref name="PostMag" />

===Effects===
The effects in ''Drag Me to Hell'' were created in many different ways, including [[Chroma key|green screen]], [[puppet]]s, prosthetics and [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name="prod" /> Bruce Jones was the visual effects supervisor on the film. Of Jones, Raimi commented, "He brought a great can-do approach to the film... He's got a great team of artists and technicians with him, and he's got great instincts."<ref name="PostMag" />

There were hundreds of visual effects in the film, and different effects houses were utilized. According to Raimi, the [[Bay Area]]'s Tippett Studio was a big player. "We also had work done by Amalgamated Pixels, Ghost VFX, KNB Effects, Home Digital, Cinesoup and IE Effects," said Raimi. According to Raimi, “Bob (Murawski) and I kept adding visual effects as post proceeded. In this film, the supernatural, the unseen, is almost another character, so sequences were developed — even in post — that would suggest the presence of the supernatural, and we kept on adding. The same with the sound effects, so it was a very ongoing, very live process in post."<ref name="PostMag" />

Director of photography [[Peter Deming]] tried to use realistic lighting in the film. Said Deming, "Normally, you'd put all corrected bulbs in, but we went with what was there, including the shots in the street. We used the streetlight look and mixed that with interior lighting. There were a lot of odd color sources that we chose to leave the way they would be naturally. It's a heightened sense of realism."<ref name="prod" /> One of the earliest projects the special effects teams did was the scene in which Mrs. Ganush attacks Christine in her car. To film the action, which included close-ups of Christine jamming her foot on the pedal, hitting the brake, and shifting gears, the team created a puzzle car which allowed the front engine compartment and back trunk — as well as all four sides and doors — to come away from the car. The roof came off in two directions.<ref name="prod" />

The [[film score]] was composed by [[Christopher Young]]. Young has worked with director Raimi previously on his films ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. The soundtrack was released on August 18, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3602-drag-me-to-hell-soundtrack-hits-stores.html|work=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=November 24, 2009|date=August 17, 2009|author=Zimmerman, Samuel|title=Drag Me to Hell soundtrack hits stores}}</ref> Sam Raimi stated that emphasis was on using the soundtrack to create a world that didn't exist, a world of the "supernatural".<ref name="PostMag" /> The score contains elements of Young's previous work on ''[[Flowers in the Attic (film)|Flowers in the Attic]]''. This is particularly apparent in the utilization of the ethereal childlike soprano vocals that feature prominently throughout the soundtrack.
