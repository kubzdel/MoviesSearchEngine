{{expand section|date=May 2015}}

The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre has ''Philosophy of a Knife'' listed as the fifth most disturbing film it has covered, and stated that while it was interesting and intense "I was reminded of [[Mel Gibson|Gibson's]] ''[[The Passion of the Christ|Passion]]'' in that the movie takes an ambitious and difficult subject, then spends most of its time focusing only on gore".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/iskanov.html#Philosophy_of_a_Knife|title = Andrey Iskanov|publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|work = Philosophy of a Knife|accessdate = November 15, 2012}}</ref>

A 0 out of 5 was given by [[Dread Central]]'s Scott A. Johnson, who concluded, "As a reviewer, one tries to find a few positive things to say about each film. Congratulations are in order for ''Philosophy of a Knife'' in that it succeeded in being the crappiest pile of masturbatory, art-house wannabe, pedantic and mean-spirited shit I've ever had the displeasure of watching".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/7661/philosophy-of-a-knife-2008/|title = ''Philosophy of a Knife'' (2008)|last = Johnson|first = Scott|publisher = [[Dread Central]]|date = 5 July 2008|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 15 November 2012}}</ref>
