== Plot ==
Mike Reilly is an [[NYPD]] detective who is called to the scene of a mysterious death in the subway system. The victim, Polidori, exhibits bleeding from his eyes and other orifices and, by the frozen look on his face, appears to have seen something horrifying before being hit by a train. Department of Health researcher Terry Huston is intrigued by the find as well, particularly when several more victims show up with identical symptoms.

When a contagious virus is ruled out, Terry and Mike team up to discover what might be killing these people. Initially they are unable to find anything to connect the deaths together; after some more digging for clues, they eventually discover that all of the victims' computers crashed shortly before their passings. They send each of the victims' hard drives to Mike's friend, Denise Stone, who is a forensic specialist.

Denise discovers that all of the victims had visited a website called Feardotcom.com, which depicts [[Voyeurism|voyeuristic]] [[torture murder]]. Upon looking at the site herself, Denise is subjected to various sights and sounds of torture that eventually drive her insane, resulting in her falling to her death from her apartment window.

Mike feels guilty, thinking that he should have never gotten Denise involved in the case. Terry figures out that people who visit the website die within 48 hours, apparently from what they feared most in their lives. Despite such dangerous knowledge, both she and Mike visit the site in order to figure out what is happening.

As they begin to experience paranoia and hallucinations (like the deceased), including that of a young girl and her inflatable ball, they race against time to figure out if any of it has any connection to an extremely vicious serial killer, Alistair Pratt, who's been eluding Mike and the FBI for years.

It is revealed that Feardotcom is, in fact, a ghost site made by one of Pratt's first victims, who is seeking revenge because people watched her being tortured and murdered. She was tortured by Pratt for 48 hours before she begged him to kill her, which explains why the victims have 48 hours to live. Mike and Terry track down Pratt and release the spirit of the murdered girl from the website, which kills Pratt. However, Mike is also killed.

The ending scene shows Terry lying in her bed with her cat.  The phone rings but she hears no one on the line, only online static.  She hangs up and hugs the cat.

==Production==
Malone stated that his goal when agreeing to direct was to make the entire film look "basically like a nightmare."{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}} Stephen Dorff was cast as the lead in the film, while Stephen Rea was cast as the villain based on Malone's appreciation of him as one of his "favorite actors."{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}} Natascha McElhone was cast as the lead female role, and Malone stated in retrospect that he felt she had been miscast: "I mean, I love[d] having her in the film, don't get me wrong, but the film should have been rewritten for her, instead of being written for somebody who was showing off how good she is at her job. Natascha has this sort of competence and elegance, so you just don't buy that with her."{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}} Jeffrey Combs, who had appeared in Malone's previous feature, ''House on Haunted Hill'', was cast in a supporting part as a detective.{{sfn|Kane|O'Regan|2010|p=160}}

In his book ''The Cinema Dreams Its Rivals: Media Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet'', film scholar Paul Young praised the film's dark cinematography, writing: <blockquote>''FearDotCom'' refuses to let [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] penetrate its [[mise-en-scène]]... ''FearDotCom'' is set in New York, but instead of providing digitized skylines and enhanced locales to fudge the differences, ''FearDotCom'' simply plunges the city into the dark... In effect, [it] manages to incarnate a sense of what film "was" before CG, a sense it underscores by building its Monogram B-film environment around the Internet.<ref>{{cite book|author=Young, Paul|title=The Cinema Dreams Its Rivals: Media Fantasy Films from Radio to the Internet|p=241|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2006|isbn= 978-0-816-63599-3|oclc=928699699}}</ref></blockquote>
