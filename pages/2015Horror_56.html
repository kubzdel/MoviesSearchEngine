== Plot ==
The film takes place over six chapters.

=== Chapter 1: Her ===
Madame leaves Darling alone as the new caretaker of an old home in New York City. Before leaving, Madame warns that the previous caretaker threw herself off the balcony. Darling becomes fascinated with an inverted cross necklace she finds in a dresser drawer. She also finds a locked door at the end of a hallway, but Madame forbids her by phone from opening it. Darling unknowingly drops the necklace while grocery shopping and a man returns it to her on the street. It is inferred that she recognizes him. After experiencing a panic attack, Darling follows the man and finds out where he lives. 

=== Chapter 2: Invocation ===
Darling begins experiencing hallucinatory visions. Noises in the home lead her outside to the balcony where she finds a Latin proverb "Abyssus abyssum invocat" which means "Deep calls to deep" ([http://wordinfo.info/unit/2320 "hell calls hell" or "one misstep leads to another"]) scrawled into a wood panel.

=== Chapter 3: THRILLS!! ===
Darling follows the man from earlier to THRILLS!!, a local lounge. They share drinks together before Darling invites him back to her house. The man mentions how the house is said to be haunted and rumored to have been a place where someone once tried conjuring the devil. Darling suddenly stabs the man to death mid-conversation, and begins raving that she is taking revenge on a man named Henry Sullivan who cannot be allowed to live because of what he did to her "that night".

=== Chapter 4: Demon ===
Darling tapes a bag over the man’s head, suffocating him, and puts his body in the tub. Darling goes to sleep, clutching the cross necklace to her chest and reciting "Abyssus abyssum invocat". Darling dreams of the dead man attacking her in her bed.

=== Chapter 5: Inferno ===
Darling finds a card on the man that identifies him as Henry Sullivan. After sawing off his head and limbs and putting them in a bag, Darling checks the ID again and sees that the name now reads James Abbott.

=== Chapter 6: The Caretaker ===
Madame calls after discovering that Darling’s reference, Dr. Abbott, was never her employer; Darling replies calmly that the doctor says she's "all right now". Madame implores Darling to leave her home. Darling asks if the locked room upstairs was the site of the devil conjuring told of in local tales. Madame doesn't answer. Darling replies, “I think I’ll become one of your ghost stories now.” Darling breaks down the locked door upstairs and is horrified by what she sees, but it is not shown to the audience. Darling paces the hall, cuts up all of her clothes and dons the cross necklace. A woman arrives at the house with two police officers, presumably having been alerted by Madame via telephone, and they find the bag of body parts after entering with a spare key. Darling hears them, climbs up to the roof and jumps off - her visions now coming full circle.

In the post-credits scene, Madame hires another young woman as the home's new caretaker, reciting the same lines she spoke to Darling upon their first meeting.

== Production ==
Shooting took place in New York City over twelve days.  Keating was influenced by [[Roman Polanski]], including ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[The Tenant]]'', and ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''.  After being contacted by Keating, Fessenden joined as an executive producer and brought on Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3364151/interview-mickey-keating-and-brian-morvant-darling/|title=[Interview] Mickey Keating and Brian Morvant Talk 'Darling' at Fantastic Fest!|last=Thurman|first=Trace|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2015-10-05|accessdate=2015-12-15}}</ref>  New York was chosen as a location to emphasize the alienation and detachment felt by Carter's character.
