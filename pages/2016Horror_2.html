==Reception==
''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' wrote a favorable review of the movie, as they felt that it was "refreshing to have a sequel work so well and for it actually not be essential that one has seen the original. Ultimately, it’s a more enjoyable ride than the first, with a payoff that packs quite a wallop."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/17167-2-jennifer-review|title=2 JENNIFER|last=UNSWORTH|first=MARTIN|date=|website=Starburst|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}</ref>

In contrast, [[Dread Central]] panned ''2 Jennifer'', stating that "Fans of bargain-basement snuff will eat this one right up, but for this lad, I prefer to keep my eyesight on level ground… solid, stable, non-shaky ground."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/182543/2-jennifer-2016/|title=2 Jennifer (2016) - Dread Central|last=Boiselle|first=Matt|date=2016-08-19|work=Dread Central|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}</ref>
