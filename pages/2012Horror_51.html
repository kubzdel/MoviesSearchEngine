==Synopsis==
Desperate to discover what has become of her sister, Ellen (Hannah Levien) infiltrates Simon Leach's ([[Bill Oberst Jr.]]) cult. All she knows is that her sister was last seen joining his group in order to find herself, only to go missing after joining. Ellen is welcomed with open arms and although her initial intent is to search for her sister, she finds herself drawn to Simon's magnetic personality and message of love and acceptance. However what she soon discovers is that she, along with all of the cult's companionship-hungry members, are being manipulated to a more sinister and dark end than she could have predicted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Kevin|title=Lionsgate releases new trailer, release date for Children of Sorrow|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/lionsgate-releases-new-trailer-release-date-for-children-of-sorrow|publisher=JoBlo|accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref>
