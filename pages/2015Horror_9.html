==Plot==
{{more plot|date=April 2017}}
All Through the House revolves around the story of a Christmas-obsessed neighborhood that becomes engulfed in fear when five-year-old Jamie Garrett mysteriously vanishes from her home. Citing various different explanations ranging from Krampus to kidnapping, the adult denizens of the district begins to treat the young girl's mother and her home as the stuff of spooky, holiday-themed legend when the missing girl’s house goes dark as her mother becomes a depressed recluse. The local children, mesmerized by the seemingly-haunted story, trade bedtime fears about their missing friend, eventually turning the tragedy into an innocuous fairytale.

Fifteen years later, Rachel Kimmel, a 22-year-old student, comes home for Christmas. The offbeat and slightly-creepy Mrs. Garrett invites Rachel to her home as she finally emerges from her self-imposed exile, determined to make this Christmas a jovial one to be remembered, which brings Rachel’s memories of the missing girl rushing back to her.

All the while, the same neighborhood is being terrorized by a faceless killer dressed in a Santa suit and mask who stalks the wintery streets- slaughtering women and castrating men. Rachel and her two best friends soon find themselves trapped in a gristly nightmare, fighting for their lives as the Santa killer's obsession zeroes in on them as well as Mrs. Garrett and her festively-decorated home.

After various terrifying encounters with the Santa killer that leave a trail of even more dead bodies behind, Rachel finally uncovers the madness behind the Santa mask and the truth behind the mysteries of the neighborhood's past. The killer’s twisted revelation sends Rachel into shock as she learns her own sick connection to the Garrett family legacy.
