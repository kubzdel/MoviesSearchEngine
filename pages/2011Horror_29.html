Brett Gallman from horror film review website ''Oh, the Horror!'' gave the film a mostly negative review. In his review, Gallman criticized the film's direction, and screenplay; stating that the film "starts with the potential to be among the best of these new-wave Corman creature features, but ends up just being in the middle of the pack".<ref name="Gallman12">{{cite web|last1=Gallman|first1=Brett|title=Horror Reviews - Camel Spiders (2012)|url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=1121|website=Oh the Horror.com|publisher=Brett Gallman|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>
Jason Coffman from ''Film Monthly.com'' gave the film a positive review, writing, "It’s not a game-changing masterpiece or anything, but ''Camel Spiders'' is proof that Corman’s approach to low-budget filmmaking is still capable of turning out fun stuff."<ref name="Coffman12">{{cite web|last1=Coffman|first1=Jason|title=Camel Spiders : FilmMonthly|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/film/video-and-dvd/camel-spiders|website=Film Monthly.com|publisher=Jason Coffman|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>
