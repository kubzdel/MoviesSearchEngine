==Story==
The film revolves around seven friends, 3 of which are magically granted the use of ninja powers to fight back against hordes of zombies, and their evil leader Eric.  The press kit for the film describes the premise as follows:<blockquote>"Seven friends, struggling with late 20s, early 30s life, find themselves in terrifying danger when a long dead loved one is magically resurrected and starts devouring souls.  To make matters worse, three of them have been granted the power of the ninja, and now must lead the fight against a power they cannot hope to vanquish.  If they fail, the undead will overrun their little town, and maybe the world."<ref name=Kit>{{cite web|title=Ninja vs. Zombies Press Kit|url=http://nvzmovie.com/download/Press_kit_full.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

The script is filled with references to other genre favorites, including but not limited to "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Lost", "Jurassic Park", "Angel", "Ghostbusters", "Chasing Amy", "Batman Returns", "The Incredibles", "Return of the Jedi", "Star Trek First Contact", "Army Of Darkness", "Dawn of the Dead", "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", "Pulp Fiction", "Dirty Harry", and more.

The closing credits thank "[[Joss Whedon]] (Who Doesn't Know We Exist)".

==Soundtrack==
The film features an eponymous theme song written and performed by [[Nick Bognar]] and Michael Roth. The song is also included on Bognar's 2009 album [[Our Mouths Are Open]].

==Critical reception==
*The production has been widely anticipated within the horror film community, due in part to its combination of two popular genres—zombies and ninjas. In a comment typifying the appeal of the hybrid, BD Horror News noted, "There are ninjas, and there are zombies, what more do you need?"<ref name=FY>{{cite web|title=Ninjas vs. Zombies to Premier Halloween Night|publisher=Fatally Yours: For the Love of Horror|url=http://www.fatally-yours.com/news/ninjas-vs-zombies-to-premiere-halloween-night/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Ninjas vs Zombies' Trailer Debut!|date=2008-09-05|publisher = BloodyDisgusting.com|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/13530}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Ninjas vs. Zombies|publisher=Arrow in the Head|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=13579}}</ref>
*In February 2009, the film garnered an "Award of Merit: Feature Film" at "The Indie Fest".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indie Award of Merit 2009|publisher=Beyond The Indie Fest|date=2009-02-26|url=http://theindiefest.com/Merit.aspx/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ninjas vs Zombies Review|publisher=More Horror News|date=2010-10-16|url=http://www.morehorror.com/ninjas-vs-zombies/}}</ref>
*Another horror genre publication, "Fatally Yours," urged its readers to see the film, asking: "What? Do we need to send the zombie army to drag you there?"<ref name=FY/> The same publication described the film as "a homegrown indy filmed right here in Northern VA. Part Evil Dead, part Clerks, part Buffy, part Bourne Identity, with some Harry Potter, a twist of vermouth and a lime chaser - uh, wait… Funny, Violent, a Rollercoaster; with GOBS of local talent - and international appeal."<ref name=FY/>
*On the other hand, the film has been criticized for its thematic similarity to earlier works. One critic, for example, joked that it should not be confused with 1987's ''singular'' ''Ninja vs. Zombie'', 1997's ''Zombie Ninja Gangbangers'', or 2004's ''[[Vampires vs. Zombies]]'', noting, "This is, er, zombieS versus ninjaS. You know, plural?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Ninjas. Zombies. Ninjas vs. Zombies?

*Before its release, the film's third trailer received the following comments from movie reviewer Chris Beaumont.  "Seriously, how can you go wrong? It has zombies and ninjas, not to mention magic and blood. This super low-budget outing looks terrible. Terribly good that is. No, the production values are not good and the acting looks even worse, but what they lack in quality and polish, they more than appear to make up for with energy and love for the genre. Looking forward to this!"<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Beaumont|title=Movie Media: The Animation Show, An American Carol, Transporter 3, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Bitch Slap, City of Ember, Ninjas vs. Zombies |publisher=Newstex (available through the Lexis News database)|date=2008-09-12}}</ref>
