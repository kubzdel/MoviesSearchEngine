==Plot==
Chanthaly is being raised alone by her overprotective father, sequestered in their home in Vientiane. She suspects that her dead mother's ghost is trying to deliver a message to her from the afterlife. After a change in the medication treating her hereditary heart condition causes the hallucinations to cease, Chanthaly must decide whether or not to risk succumbing to her terminal illness to hear her mother's last words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://littlelaosontheprairie.org/2013/03/24/mattie-dos-horror-film-chanthaly/ |title=mattie dos horror film chanthaly |publisher=littlelaosontheprairie.org |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}</ref>

==Entering into public domain and "open sourcing"==
During a crowd funding campaign for Do's second feature film ''[[Dearest Sister]]'', Do and Larsen, who are the sole owner of the copyright, offered to enter the film into the public domain if a US$30,000 goal was reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/eztv-open-source-horror-movie-140617/ |title=EZTV Users Help to Fund Horror Movie, and Open Source Another |publisher=torrentfreak.com |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref> After reaching the goal, in addition to releasing the copyright, all raw footage and other production material was made available through the [[Internet Archive]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Chanthaly.Open.Source.Project.Footage-MANGO |title=Footage Collection: Chanthaly |publisher=Mattie Do |date=2014-06-17 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref> and the torrent site [[EZTV]], thus "open sourcing" the entire project. 

Do put forth a "community challenge", inviting fans to re-edit the film using the material.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/98327805 |title=Community Challenge |publisher=Mattie Do |date=2014-08-17 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}</ref>
