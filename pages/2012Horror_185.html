==Synopsis==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
The film follows Laura (Kayden Rose), a young woman who is incredibly unhappy with her life. Her career as an artist is going nowhere and she's trapped in an [[abusive relationship]] with her boyfriend. After one night of incredibly rough sex, Laura discovers several bruises on her body that begin to spread. She initially pays them no more heed than the bruises her boyfriend otherwise gives her, but as time passes the bruises begin to spread over her entire body. As her body begins to decay at an ever increasing rate, Laura begins to isolate herself and experience dreams filled with death and decay.
