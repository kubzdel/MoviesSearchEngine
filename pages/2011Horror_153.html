'''''Shark Night''''' (advertised as '''''Shark Night 3D''''') <!-- "3D" is not part of the title --> is a 2011 American [[horror film]] directed by [[David R. Ellis]] and written by Will Hayes and Jesse Studenberg. It stars [[Sara Paxton]], [[Katharine McPhee]],  [[Alyssa Diaz]], [[Dustin Milligan]], and [[Joel David Moore]]. The film, which was negatively received by critics and grossed $40 million worldwide, was released in [[Real D 3D]] and [[Digital 3D]]. This is Ellis' final film before his death.

==Plot==
Seven [[Tulane University]] undergraduates – Sara, Nick, Beth, Malik, Maya, Blake and Gordon – drive to Sara's family vacation home on a private lake. There, Sara encounters her old boyfriend, Dennis, and his friend Red. Nick, Blake, Malik and Maya go wake-boarding when a shark attacks Malik. He is able to swim back to shore – missing his right arm. When Nick swims into the lake to retrieve Malik's arm, he is pursued by the shark, barely making it to shore. Being a pre-med student, he stabilizes Malik, and they all take him to the hospital. 

Blood from Malik's wound attracts a shark that attacks the boat. Maya (Malik's girlfriend who he was about to propose to) is knocked into the water and eaten. The shark damages the steering column of the boat, causing it to crash in front of the boathouse. Sara, Nick and Malik make it to shore. 

Dennis and Red arrive and agree to take Beth and Gordon to the mainland. During the boat trip, Dennis reveals that he and Red put the sharks in the lake and feed college students to them. Dennis forces Gordon into the water by shooting him; he swims to a [[mangrove]] tree but is devoured by a [[bull shark]]. Red and Dennis force Beth to strip down and feed her to [[cookiecutter shark]]s.

Malik arms himself with a harpoon and ventures into the water to kill the shark that killed Maya. His wound attracts a [[hammerhead shark]]; he kills it but is further wounded. Nick and Blake pull the shark to shore, and Nick finds a camera attached to its belly. Blake decides to take Malik to the mainland on a jet ski. When they are pursued by sharks, Malik sacrifices himself and later Blake is killed by a [[great white shark]]. 

Meanwhile, Sara tells Nick the reason why she avoided this place for more than three years. She dates Dennis for two years but breaks up with him before leaving for college. On their farewell diving trip, Sara's air gauge breaks and when she tries to get a breath from Dennis', he stares at her and then just swims away. She somehow makes to the surface and in her anger, she tries leave Dennis behind and starts the engine, inadvertently injuring his face with the propeller.  

Sheriff Sabin visits Sara and Nick and gives them soup, which makes Nick and Sara's dog, who has also eaten the soup, pass out. Sara hears Dennis and Red speaking from Sabin's radio, describing Beth's death. Dennis and Red then appear and take Sara to their boat, while Sabin prepares to dunk Nick into the lake, where [[sand tiger shark]]s wait. Sabin reveals that he, Dennis and Red have been inspired by the [[Discovery Channel]]'s ''[[Shark Week]]'' and ''[[Faces of Death]]'' videos to film people being eaten by sharks. Nick is able to break free and ignite a can of gas. Badly burned, Sabin plunges into the lake and is eaten by a sand shark. 

Red throws her dog into the water and soon after Dennis calls up Carl, the man from the bait shop, telling him to release another great white shark, Dennis and Red lower her into the lake in a shark cage. As Dennis is about to release her, Nick arrives and takes Red hostage. After a scuffle during which Dennis kills Red in order to catch Nick off guard, Nick shoves Dennis into the water and tries to set Sara free but Dennis appears and tries strangling him. Nick escapes as a great white shark devours Dennis. Nick kills the shark and frees Sara. Nick, Sara, and Sara's dog swim to the boat, having survived. A distance away, another great white shark breaches, signifying that sharks remain in the lake.

The sharks featured in the film were animatronic sharks built by Edge Innovations, who previously built sharks for movies such as ''[[Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)|Deep Blue Sea]]'', ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', and even the Orca in ''[[Free Willy]]''. According to [[Walt Conti]], the head of Edge Innovations, two models for each shark were built. One "attacker" and one "swimmer." Each of which required very different internal mechanisms. "Sharks are this total contrast of stealthy, cruising lurking and these intense bursts of power," Conti says. "We split those two behaviors into two different types of models, and optimized each to do one of those things best." <ref>http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/digital/3d/shark-night-3ds-predators-blow-jaws-out-of-the-water</ref>

Although the movie was always going to be titled "Shark Night 3D" overseas Ellis fought for a name change for the North American release, at one point wanting to release the film under the title "Untitled Shark Thriller 3D.<ref name="vultureuntitled">{{cite web|last1=Broddeser-Akner|first1=Claude|title=Snakes on a Plane Director Fighting to Call His Next Film Untitled 3D Shark Thriller|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/02/snakes_on_a_plane_director_fig.html|website=Vulture|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Bloody Disgusting would later compare the proposed title of the film to Elis's previous film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/23364|title='Shark Night 3D' Could Be Titled 'Untitled 3D Shark Thriller'?!|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>
