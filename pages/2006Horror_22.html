In a brief prologue set in 1947, Elizabeth Short (Danielle Petty, as "Ivy Elfstrom") is murdered by an unseen assailant. In present-day Los Angeles, a "copycat" serial killer is dumping partially mutilated female bodies in an emulation of Elizabeth Short's murderer. Women answering an ad for a movie audition are systematically killed by [[Satanism|Satan worshippers]]. One of the policemen becomes obsessed with the story of Elizabeth Short, researchs the original 40s murder online, and dreams about it. Eventually, he comes face-to-face with the killers.<ref name="review1">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J41GSM Ulli Lommel's Black Dahlia amazon.com synopsis]</ref>
