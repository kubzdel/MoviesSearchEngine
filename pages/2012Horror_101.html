'''''House at the End of the Street''''' is a 2012 American [[psychological thriller|psychological]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Mark Tonderai]] that stars [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[Gil Bellows]], and [[Elisabeth Shue]]. The film's plot revolves around a teenaged girl named Elissa, who along with her newly divorced mother Sarah, moves to a new neighborhood, only to discover that the house at the end of the street was the site of a gruesome double murder committed by a girl named Carrie-Anne who disappeared without a trace. Elissa then starts a relationship with Carrie Anne's brother Ryan, who now lives in the same house.

Although filming had been completed in 2010, the film was not released until 2012 by [[Relativity Media]]. Despite a negative response from critics, Jennifer Lawrence's performance was praised and the film was a commercial success, ranking number one at the box office in its opening weekend.

==Plot==
A newly divorced medical doctor Sarah Cassidy ([[Elisabeth Shue]]), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) move to a small, upscale town. They are disturbed to discover the house they are moving into is on the same street as a house in which a family used to live before they were massacred. The story of the massacre is told to them by the neighbors. Four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Anne Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan ([[Max Thieriot]]) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver ([[Gil Bellows]]), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter.

The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts seeing Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Anne by allowing her to fall from a [[Swing (seat)|swing]] when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting [[brain damage]] from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder.  Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Anne (Eva Link) in a hidden room. Carrie-Anne manages to escape and approaches a young couple in a car while brandishing a kitchen knife. Ryan catches up to her before she can reach the couple but accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to a diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy ([[Jordan Hayes (actress)|Jordan Hayes]]).

Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started. She finds tampons in the kitchen garbage and explores the house with suspicion until she finds the secret room and is attacked by Carrie-Anne, who is revealed to actually be Peggy. Ryan restrains "Carrie-Anne" while frantically screaming at Elissa to leave. Elissa finds blue contact lenses and Peggy Jones's wallet in the kitchen. Ryan has kidnapped the waitress and attempted to make her look like Carrie-Anne. Elissa tells Ryan she has to go home but Ryan hits her, knocking her unconscious. 

Elissa wakes to find herself tightly tied to a chair. Ryan reveals that Carrie-Anne actually died during the swing accident. He says his parents blamed him for it, and reveals that he was the one who killed them. He explains that he wants Elissa, but that he needs Carrie-Anne and cannot have both. Officer Weaver goes to Ryan's house to look for Elissa, but Ryan stabs him to death. Elissa frees herself and tries to escape in Ryan's car, but Ryan knocks her out with [[chloroform]] and traps her in his car trunk with Peggy's body. Sarah arrives and is also stabbed by Ryan. Elissa struggles out of the car and ultimately shoots Ryan with Weaver's gun. When she approaches him, he suddenly wakes up and grabs her wrist. When Ryan attempts to stab Elissa with the knife, Sarah strikes him in the head with the hammer. 

Elissa and Sarah move out; Ryan is placed in a psychiatric ward (behavior hospital). A flashback shows young Ryan in girl's clothing about to blow out birthday candles. His mother calls him "Carrie-Anne" and when Ryan protests that his name is Ryan, not Carrie-Anne, she slaps him violently; it is revealed that Ryan was an only child and that Carrie-Anne is not real.

===Critical reception===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 11% based on 61 reviews with an average rating of 3.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Poorly conceived, clumsily executed, and almost completely bereft of scares, ''House at the End of the Street'' strands its talented star in a film as bland as its title."<ref>{{cite web |title = House at the End of the Street (2012) |url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_at_the_end_of_the_street |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 31 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/house-at-the-end-of-the-street|title=House at the End of the Street Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

==Home Media==
''House at the End of the Street'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] on January 8, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehdroom.com/news/House-at-the-End-of-the-Street-with-Jennifer-Lawrence-Blu-ray-is-Unrated/11511 |title=House at the End of the Street with Jennifer Lawrence Blu-ray is Unrated |publisher=Thehdroom.com |date=2012-10-27 |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/house-at-the-end-of-the-street-blu-ray/ |title=Killer Blu-ray Art For ‘House at the End of the Street’ |publisher=NextMovie |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}</ref>

===Unrated cut===
The unrated cut was also released on January 8, 2013. The extended edition increased the length of certain scenes in the final cut by a few seconds and the amount of violence, blood, and gore was increased by a small amount. The extended cut also included an additional twist in which Bill Weaver was actually a family friend of the Jacobsons and was aware of Carrie-Anne's fate, and he also knew about Ryan's abuse, but did nothing to help him. On the day of Carrie-Anne's accident, he supplied John and Mary Jacobson with drugs and actually could have prevented Carrie-Anne's death if he had not sold them the drugs, as the drugs prevented John and Mary from heeding the cries of Ryan, and he was then disowned as a friend by John Jacobson.
