Filming began in [[Louisiana]] in March 2011 and the film was released in [[Real D 3D]] on June 20, 2012 in the United Kingdom and June 22, 2012 in the United States.

-->
In 1818, [[Abraham Lincoln]] ([[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]]) lives in [[Indiana]] with his parents, [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy]] ([[Robin McLeavy]]) and [[Thomas Lincoln|Thomas]] ([[Joseph Mawle]]), who work at a [[Slave plantation#Slavery|plantation]] owned by Jack Barts ([[Marton Csokas]]). There, Lincoln rushes to the aid of his friend, a young [[African American]] boy, [[William H. Johnson|William Johnson]] ([[Anthony Mackie]]), being beaten by a slaver. Because of his son's actions, Thomas is fired. That night, Lincoln sees Barts break into his house and attack Nancy. She falls ill the following day, and dies shortly afterwards. Thomas tells Lincoln that Barts poisoned Nancy.

Nine years later in 1827, a vengeful Lincoln tries to kill Barts at the docks, but Barts, who is actually a [[vampire]], overpowers him. However, before Barts can kill him, Lincoln is rescued by Henry Sturges ([[Dominic Cooper]]). Sturges explains that vampires exist, and offers to teach Lincoln to be a vampire hunter. Lincoln accepts and, after a decade of training, travels to [[Springfield, Illinois]]. During his training, Sturges tells Lincoln that the vampires in America descend from Adam ([[Rufus Sewell]]), a vampire who owns a plantation in [[New Orleans]] with his sister, Vadoma ([[Erin Wasson]]). Sturges also tells Lincoln of the vampires' weakness, [[silver]], and presents him with a silver pocket watch.

In Springfield, Lincoln befriends shopkeeper [[Joshua Fry Speed|Joshua Speed]] ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), and meets [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]] ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]). Though Sturges warned him not to form any close relationships, Lincoln develops romantic feelings for Mary.

Lincoln successfully finds and defeats Barts. Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturges is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturges, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam. Because Sturges' soul was impure, he became a vampire, and that prevented him from harming Adam or any other vampire (since "Only the living can kill the dead"). Sturges has since been training vampire hunters, hoping to destroy Adam.

Disappointed, Lincoln decides to abandon his mission. However, Adam learns of his activities and kidnaps Johnson to lure Lincoln into a [[ambush|trap]] at his plantation. Adam captures Lincoln and tries to recruit him, revealing his plans to turn the United States into a nation of the undead. Speed rescues his friends, and they escape to [[Ohio]].

Lincoln marries Mary and begins his political career, campaigning to abolish slavery. It is at this time in the movie Lincoln symbolically puts on the top hat which he dons the rest of the movie. Sturges warns Lincoln that the slave trade keeps vampires under control, as vampires use slaves for food, and if Lincoln interferes, the vampires will retaliate. After Lincoln's [[United States presidential election, 1860|election]] as [[President of the United States of America]], he moves to the [[White House]] with Mary, where they have a son, [[William Wallace Lincoln]] ([[Cameron M. Brown]]).  William is later bitten by Vadoma and dies.

[[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] ([[John Rothman]]) convinces Adam to deploy his vampires on the front lines. Lincoln orders the confiscation of all the silverware in the area and has it melted to produce silver weapons. Speed, believing that Lincoln is tearing the nation apart, defects and informs Adam that Lincoln will transport the silver by train.

On the train, Adam and Vadoma, who have set fire to the upcoming trestle, attack Lincoln, Sturges, and Johnson. During the fight, in which Speed is killed, Adam learns that the train holds only rocks. Lincoln reveals that Speed's betrayal was a ruse to lure Adam into a trap. Lincoln uses his watch to stab Adam, killing him, and the three escape the train before it explodes. Meanwhile, Mary and the ex-slaves have transported the silver to Gettysburg through the [[Underground Railroad]].

The now leaderless Confederate vampires stage a final, massive [[Pickett's Charge|assault]] and are met head on by the Union. Armed with their silver weapons, the Union soldiers destroy the vampires and eventually win the battle. During that battle, Mary confronts Vadoma, the vampire that killed her son, and kills her.

Nearly two years later, on [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|April 14, 1865]], Sturges tells Lincoln that the remaining vampires have fled the country. Sturges tries to convince Lincoln to allow him to turn Lincoln into a vampire, so that he can become immortal and continue to fight vampires, but Lincoln declines.

In modern times, Sturges approaches a man at a bar in [[Washington, D.C.]] as he once approached Lincoln.

=== Reception ===
As of November 9, 2014, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a "rotten" approval score of 35%, based on 181 reviews, with an average score of 4.9/10. The consensus reads that the film "has visual style to spare, but its overly serious tone doesn't jibe with its decidedly silly central premise, leaving filmgoers with an unfulfilling blend of clashing ingredients." [[Emanuel Levy]] of EmanuelLevy.com wrote that "Though original, this is a strenuous effort to combine the conventions of two genres."<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/abraham_lincoln_vampire_hunter/ Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter â€“ Movie Reviews â€“ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> The movie also garnered a "mixed or average" score of 42 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 35 reviews.<ref>[http://www.metacritic.com/movie/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More â€“ Metacritic]</ref>

[[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine elaborates, saying that "The historical epic and the monster movie run on parallel tracks, occasionally colliding but never forming a coherent whole."<ref>[http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/21/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-four-score-and-seven-corpses/ Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter Movie Review: Four-score and Seven Corpses | Entertainment | TIME.com]</ref> [[Christy Lemire]] of [[Associated Press]] meanwhile, comments on the film's tenor and visual effects, saying "What ideally might have been playful and knowing is instead uptight and dreary, with a visual scheme that's so fake and cartoony, it depletes the film of any sense of danger," awarding the film a rating of 1.5 out of 4.<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/2012/06/20/3668241/review-abraham-lincoln-a-murky.html Review: `Abraham Lincoln' a murky, joyless hunt â€“ KansasCity.com]</ref> [[Joe Morgenstern]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' agrees, saying, "Someone forgot to tell the filmmakers ... that the movie was supposed to be fun. Or at least smart."<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304765304577480221820498662 Brave | Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter | To Rome With Love | Pixar Plays It Safe | Film Reviews by Joe Morgenstern â€“ WSJ.com]</ref>

Joe Neumaler of ''[[New York Daily News]]'' gives the film a rating of 1 out of 5, writing, "This insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously, which is truly deadly."<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-benjamin-walker-a-bloody-good-combination-article-1.1099965?localLinksEnabled=false â€˜Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter,â€™ with Benjamin Walker, is not a bloody good combination â€“ NY Daily News]</ref> The title is praised by [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who adds, "it's too bad someone had to spoil things by making a movie to go with it."<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/movies/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter.html â€˜Abraham Lincoln â€“ Vampire Hunterâ€™ - NYTimes.com]</ref> The title is further commented on by Barbara VanDenburgh from the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', who says, "The problem with movies based on a single joke is that a single joke is rarely funny enough to sustain the running time of a feature-length film".

[[Tony Kushner]], the script writer of the actual Abraham Lincoln biopic released that same year, has stated that he thought the film was a "godforsaken mess", although this opinion had nothing to do with a historical perspective.

Positive response, meanwhile, came from Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', "''Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter'' has heart to spare, and the occasional silvered bayonet to run it through."<ref>[http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2012-06-22/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter/ Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter â€“ Film Calendar â€“ The Austin Chronicle]</ref> ''[[USA Today]]'' reviewer Scott Bowles remarks, "A stylish slasher of a movie, a monster flick that does its vampires right, if not their real-life counterparts," giving the film 2.5 out of 4.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/story/2012-06-22/abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter-review/55748718/1?csp=34life 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' finely dices history â€“ USATODAY.com]</ref> Further acclaim came from [[Joe Williams (film critic)|Joe Williams]] of ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', who calls it, "The best action movie of the summer," and praising the film for presenting "a surprisingly respectful tone toward American values and their most heroic proponent", calling "the battlefield scenes [...] suitably epic" and finally commending leading star Benjamin Walker, "a towering actor who looks like a young Liam Neeson and never stoops to caricature."<ref>[http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/honest-abe-slays-demons-in-vampire-hunter/article_4476c47c-ba93-11e1-aafc-0019bb30f31a.html Honest Abe slays demons in 'Vampire Hunter']</ref>
