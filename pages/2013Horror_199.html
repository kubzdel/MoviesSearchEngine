==Plot==
[[Jay Baruchel]] arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor [[Seth Rogen]], who invites him to attend a housewarming party hosted by [[James Franco]]. Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party as he doesn't know anybody there, so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store for cigarettes, but beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky. Seth and Jay flee back to Franco's house, only to find the party unharmed. An earthquake strikes and the partygoers rush outside, but [[Michael Cera]], who was high on [[cocaine]], gets impaled by a lamppost and a [[sinkhole|large hole]] opens in James' yard, swallowing most of the partygoers. Seth, Jay, James, [[Jonah Hill]], and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] survive, run back inside the house, learn that the biggest earthquake has struck Los Angeles on the news, take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help.

The next morning, [[Danny McBride]], also in the house and unaware of the crisis, wastes most of the food and water in the house. The others tell him of the previous night's events, which he initially does not believe until a man outside is decapitated as they watch. Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement, and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the [[Apocalypse]] predicted in the [[Book of Revelation]]. Later, [[Emma Watson]], another survivor of the party, returns. However, due to a misunderstanding, she believes the group is planning to rape her and leaves, taking the group's remaining drinks with her. Craig is chosen to travel outside to the basement for water, but finds the door is locked and returns after an encounter with an unknown being.

Jay and Seth reach the basement by digging through the floor and find the water, but Danny ends up wasting most of it out of spite, prompting him to be kicked out of the house. Before he leaves, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months ago, but he stayed at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]] and told Danny not to tell Seth, due to their strained friendship. After he leaves, Jonah gently chastises Jay, causing him to punch Hill, giving him a nasty [[nosebleed]]. Later that night, Jonah prays to God to kill Jay due to his immense hatred of him, but he gets raped and [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a demon. The next day, Jay and Craig go to a neighboring home for supplies and escape a demonic bull. Meanwhile, Seth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah, but Jay and Craig arrive in time to knock him out. The group subdues Jonah and tie him up, but during an [[exorcism]] attempt, Jay and Seth get into a fight and knock a candle over. A fire starts, engulfing Jonah and the house in flames and forcing the others to flee outside.

James suggests taking his car to his home in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], but finds the car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into [[Heaven]]. They are then captured by a group of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] led by Danny and his [[Gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp,]] [[Channing Tatum]]. James volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others, but taunts and flips Danny off as he ascends to Heaven, causing the beam to vanish. Danny warns James that he was being petty for not going to Heaven and joins the cannibals to eat him alive. Seth and Jay escape and encounter [[Satan]]. Jay apologizes to Seth for his actions and as Satan attempts to eat them, a beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his presence prevents him from ascending into Heaven. Seth lets go as a result, and another beam strikes him and slices off Satan's crotch and he and Jay both finally ascend to Heaven where they meet Craig, who tells them that it is a place where any desire comes true. Jay wishes for the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the band performs "[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]" as everyone dances.

==Production==
Rogen and Goldberg told interviewers, "We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and [[Busta Rhymes]] were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Sony]] lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gd6yr/we_are_seth_rogen_and_evan_goldberg_ask_us/caj3yuv?context=3|title=We are Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg - Ask Us Anything|work=[[Reddit]]|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2013|author1=Rogen, Seth|author2=Goldberg, Evan}}</ref> The film is also based on ''[[Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse]]'', a [[short film]] created by Goldberg and Jason Stone in 2007.<ref name="Chitwood">{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Aziz Ansari Joins Seth Rogen in THE APOCALYPSE|url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=April 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FTh9x3i5?url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|archivedate=March 29, 2013|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, "If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of [[Charlie Kaufman]]. Seth and I always loved ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''  too. And the popularity of [[reality television]] now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real.

But ''This Is the End'' . . truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest."<ref>{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687779,00.html|title=Movie Review: This Is the End|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 8, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref> Brian D. Johnson of ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] scenario of ''This Is the End''...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apoca]]-[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/06/07/was-armageddon-always-this-complicated/|title=Was Armageddon always this complicated?|work=Maclean's|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}</ref> At the other end of the spectrum, Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' compared the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus, giving it one and a half stars out of five. The critic referred to the actors in the film as "the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/summer-entertainment/this-is-the-end-leaves-viewers-asking-when-will-it-be-over/article12469461/#dashboard/follows/|title=This Is the End leaves viewers asking: When will it be over?|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Groen|first=Rick D.|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Possible sequel==
When [[Evan Goldberg]] was asked whether a sequel to the film was probable, he said, "If you ask me, I'd say there's a pretty good chance of a sequel. If you ask Seth Rogen, he'd say no." In June 2013, Goldberg announced ideas for a sequel in which the apocalypse occurs at the premiere of ''This Is the End''. "Seth's a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera is a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys are back," Goldberg said in an interview. "We have a lot of ideas: a heaven and hell, for example, and a garden of Eden version where Danny [McBride] is Adam."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/evan-goldberg-thinks-this-is-the-end-sequel-is-entirely-possible/|title=Evan Goldberg Thinks 'This is The End' Sequel is Entirely Possible|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref> Despite this, Goldberg has stated that it would be difficult to recreate the casting conditions from the first film due to different schedules, believing them to be a stroke of luck, saying, "I honestly don't know if we could get the guys together [again]." In May 2014, Seth Rogen posted a status on Twitter saying, "I don't think we'll make a sequel to ''This Is the End'', but if we did, it would be called ''No, THIS Is the End''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/472174283360567296|title=Seth Rogen on Twitter|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}</ref>
