==Reception==
''ScreenRelish'' gave a mixed review for ''Lemon Tree Passage'', panning the film overall and stating that it was "a film that wants to send shivers down your spine (and certainly the promotional artwork does that in spades), but your brain is too preoccupied trying to figure out what’s going on, that it ultimately proves to be a somewhat dissatisfying experience."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Caley|first1=Andy|title=FrightFest 2014: LEMON TREE PASSAGE Review|url=http://www.screenrelish.com/2014/08/25/lemon-tree-passage-review/|publisher=ScreenRelish|accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref> ''[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]'' wrote that while Campbell "[pulled] his weight" as a director, the film's script was flawed and that it was overall uneven.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Russell|title=Lemon Tree Passage (review)|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/movies/movie/lemon-tree-passage|publisher=SBS|accessdate=26 September 2014}}</ref>
