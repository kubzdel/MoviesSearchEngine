== Plot ==
The film opens with Vanessa ([[Iza Calzado]]) who was killed when she was visited by her long dead husband as her companion. The film then cuts to [[protagonist]] Romano ([[Robin Padilla]]), a retired military operative who goes into seclusion after being seriously wounded in battle and almost died, discovers that he has the uncanny ability of seeing ghosts around people who will soon encounter sudden, disastrous deaths. Worried of his brother, Romano’s blind sister Isabel ([[Rhian Ramos]]) persuades him to return to Manila with the help of Louella ([[Sunshine Dizon]]), Romano’s childhood friend who is a doctor and harbors affection for him.

An aspiring actress, Kristina ([[Katrina Halili]]), a widow, Lumen (Glydel Mercado), and her nephew, Eric ([[Hero Angeles]]) hitch a ride with Romano, Isabel and Louella along with Louella’s driver, Baste ([[Mark Bautista]]). On their van's way back to the city, the group manages to avoid a fatal accident on the road as Romano woke up just in time to warn Baste - having just dreamt of the impending tragedy. As he steps out of the van to survey the scene, he started seeing ghosts surrounding the van and eventually looking at him. The ghosts are an old man, a young woman with hair covering her face, two more adult men, and a woman who Romano thinks look like his mother. He also hears a baby crying though he is unable to see it. After this, the group stopped to eat dinner and rest in a small eatery in [[Baguio]]. Just as Lumen mentioned that she needs to use the ladies room, one of the adult male ghosts showed himself to Romano and interacted with him. Soon after, Lumen died as a [[rail spike]] pins her head. The next tragic event happened as Eric died of electrocution while attending Lumen's husband's wake, right after the other adult male ghost grabbed Romano to get his attention. 

The group now consulted with a local elder who informs them that Romano can see ghosts because of an open third eye. Moreover, the ghosts that he sees are "Sundo" - or those who the grim reaper uses to fetch a person who is about to die. The Sundo can be anyone such as a spouse, siblings, parents, or a friend - anyone who has previously died and has a close relationship with the person. Because Romano prevented the earlier road accident from happening when they are "meant" to die, they still "owe" the grim reaper their lives and this debt will be collected no matter what. After leaving the local elder, the group discussed that there are 7 people in the van but Romano only saw 5 ghosts. Romano is unsure whether the ghost of their mom is his or his sister Isabel's Sundo. 

Kristina and Baste also died right after their Sundo show themselves to Romano. Baste's Sundo is the old man who turned out to be his grandfather who raised him. Kristina's Sundo is the young woman with hair covering her face who is a twin sister that she is not aware exists. After these deaths, Romano, Isabel and Louella decided to stay in Louella's apartment and spend the night.

Louella, feeling emotional and scared, finally confessed to Romano that the remaining mysterious ghost - a crying baby - is her Sundo. She got pregnant while in medical school, felt that she was not ready to be a mother and had an abortion.  

Later on, Romano was lured to the balcony by Isabel as his Sundo. As he realizes that his sister is already dead, the grim reaper pushed him over the balcony. Romano lands into the pool and regains consciousness. As he ascends from the pool he saw a distraught Louella crying. She tells him that he can't be her Sundo, as she already repaid the grim reaper with a life - that is Isabel's life and not her own. She insists that she cheated death by doing so and he can't fetch her. Romano realizes that Louella killed his sister and a flashback of Louella smothering a sleeping Isabel with a pillow is shown. Louella continued to plead to Romano and look visibly scared. Romano then looked at the pool and saw his dead floating body. It turned out that he has died in the water and is now Louella's Sundo. The end scene show the grim reaper going for a screaming Louella as she dies.
