== Production ==
The writer-directors wanted to keep the film from descending into [[camp (style)|camp]], so they kept the tone serious enough that people could still relate to the characters and their actions despite the situations.  Focus was also put on keeping the metaphor of baggage in a relationship relatable beyond the literal interpretation of supernatural events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/837275-sxsw-2015-video-abigail-hardingham-and-the-blaine-brothers-on-nina-forever|title=SXSW 2015 Video: Abigail Hardingham and The Blaine Brothers on 'Nina Forever'|last=Bibbiani|first=William|work=[[CraveOnline]]|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2015-03-25}}</ref>  Production began in May 2013 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/blaines-begin-debut-feature-nina-forever/5054474.article|title=Blaine Brothers' debut feature Nina Forever begins production|last=Rosser|first=Michael|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2015-03-25}}</ref>  The Blaine brothers used a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to fund aspects of the film.
