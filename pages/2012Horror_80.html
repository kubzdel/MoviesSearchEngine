'''''Frankenweenie''''' is a 2012 American [[3D film|3D]] [[stop-motion animation|stop-motion-animated]] [[fantasy]] [[horror comedy]] film directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/frankenweenie-v424945|work=Allmovie|title=Frankenweenie|accessdate=September 26, 2012|author=Wheeler, Jeremy}}</ref> It is a [[remake]] of Burton's [[Frankenweenie (1984 film)|1984 short film]] of the same name and is a parody of and a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' based on [[Mary Shelley]]'s [[Frankenstein|book of the same name]]. The voice cast includes four actors who worked with Burton on previous films: [[Winona Ryder]] (''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''); [[Martin Short]] (''[[Mars Attacks!]]''); [[Catherine O'Hara]] (''Beetlejuice'' and ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''); and [[Martin Landau]] (''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' and ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''), along with some new voice actors, such as [[Charlie Tahan]] and [[Atticus Shaffer]].

''Frankenweenie'' is in [[black-and-white|black and white]]. It is also the fourth stop-motion film produced by Burton and the first of those four that is not a [[musical film|musical]]. In the film, a boy named Victor loses his dog, a [[Bull Terrier]] named Sparky, and uses the power of electricity to [[resurrection|resurrect]] him — but is then blackmailed by his peers into revealing how they too can reanimate their deceased past pets and other creatures, resulting in mayhem. The [[tongue-in-cheek]] film contains numerous references and [[parody|parodies]] related to the book, past film versions of the book and other literary classics.

''Frankenweenie'', the first black-and-white feature film and the first stop-motion film to be released in [[IMAX 3D]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|title=Disney to Release Tim Burton's FRANKENWEENIE in IMAX 3D|url=http://collider.com/frankenweenie-imax-3d/150366/|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Collider.com|date=March 6, 2012}}</ref> was released on October 5, 2012 and met with positive reviews and moderate box office sales. The film won the [[Saturn Award for Best Animated Film]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Academy Award]]; a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film|Golden Globe]]; a [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film|BAFTA]]; and an [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature|Annie Award]] for Best Film in each respective animated category.<ref name="Oscar" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Globe|first=Golden|title=Golden Globes 2013: full list of nominations|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/13/golden-globes-2013-nominations-list|accessdate=January 3, 2013|newspaper=guardian.co.uk|date=December 13, 2012<!-- 14.32 GMT-->|location=London}}</ref><ref name="BAFTA" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|title=Disney Leads Annie Award Best Picture Nominations|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/annie-award-nominations-2012-disney-396703|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 3, 2012|author2=Jordan Zakarin}}</ref>

==Plot==
Young scientist [[Victor Frankenstein]] lives with his parents, Edward  and Susan Frankenstein, and his beloved [[Bull Terrier]] dog, Sparky, in the quiet town of New Holland. Victor's intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, his somber next-door neighbor, Elsa Van Helsing, mischievous, Edgar "E" Gore, obese and gullible Bob, overconfident Toshiaki, creepy Nassor, and an eccentric girl nicknamed Weird Girl, but communicates little with them due to his relationship with his dog. Concerned with his son's isolation, Victor's father encourages him to take up [[baseball]] and make achievements outside of science. Victor hits a [[home run]] at his first game, but Sparky, pursuing the ball, is struck by a car and killed.

Inspired by his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski's demonstration of [[Galvanism|the effect of electricity on dead frogs]], a depressed Victor digs up Sparky's corpse, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic and successfully reanimates him with lightning. Seeing Weird Girl's living cat, Mr. Whiskers, the undead Sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to [[Undead|raise the dead]]. The two reanimate a dead goldfish, which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the undead fish to Toshiaki and Bob, which, in panic of losing the upcoming science fair, inspires them to make a rocket out of soda bottles, which causes Bob to break his arm and Mr. Rzykruski to be blamed and fired due to his accused influencing and reviling the townsfolk for questioning his methods when he steps up for self-defense. So, the gym teacher replaces Mr. Rzykruski.

Eventually, Edgar's fish disappears when he tries to show it to a skeptical Nassor (who was told by Toshiaki), and when Edgar is confronted by Toshiaki, Nassor and Bob on the baseball field at school, he accidentally reveals Victor's actions, inspiring them to try reanimation themselves. Victor's parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victor's reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters — Mr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, resulting in him fusing with it and becoming a monstrous bat-cat with wings and fangs. Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a [[wererat]], Nassor revives his mummified hamster Colossus and Toshiaki's turtle Shelley is covered in [[Miracle Gro]] and turns into a [[kaiju]]. Bob's [[Sea-Monkeys]] grow into amphibious humanoids. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc.

After finding Sparky at the town's pet cemetery, Victor sees the monsters heading to the fair and goes with his classmates to help deal with them — the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after both being electrocuted. During the chaos, Persephone, Elsa's pet poodle, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill with Elsa and Victor chasing after. The townsfolk blame Sparky for Elsa's disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which Mayor Burgermeister accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa and Persephone, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. A final confrontation ensues, and just as Mr. Whiskers has Sparky cornered, a flaming piece of wood breaks off and impales Mr. Whiskers, killing him. The windmill then collapses on Sparky, killing him again. To reward him for his bravery and saving Victor, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more. Persephone comes to Sparky as the two dogs share their love and kiss.

==Production==

===Development===
Although [[Tim Burton]] signed with Disney to direct two films in [[Disney Digital 3D]], including ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and his remake of ''Frankenweenie'', development for its full-length stop motion version dates as far back as November 2005, when scripts had been written by [[Josann McGibbon]] and Sara Parriott.<ref>{{cite news | author = Denise Martin | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117933003 | title = USA eyes Grazer's ''Wife'' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = November 15, 2005 | accessdate = August 15, 2008}}</ref> [[John August]] was approached for a rewrite in 2006,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://johnaugust.com/archives/2007/frankenweenie | title = Frankenweenie | work = [[John August]].com | date = November 27, 2007 | accessdate = October 31, 2008}}</ref> but was not hired until January 2009. Like the original, the feature version is shot in black and white. Many of the animation artists and crew from ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' are involved.<ref name=release>{{cite news|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=John August tackling two film projects|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-august-tackling-two-film-78026|accessdate=January 23, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 21, 2009}}</ref> In addition to remaking his earlier project, Burton is also borrowing heavily from his design from the titular character of ''[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]'' for Sparky.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smithson|first=Sean|title=NEW ONE SHEET FOR TIM BURTON'S FRANKENWEENIE|url=http://twitchfilm.com/news/2012/02/new-one-sheet-for-tim-burtons-frankenweenie.php|accessdate=March 6, 2012|newspaper=Twitch Film|date=February 2, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229052907/http://twitchfilm.com/news/2012/02/new-one-sheet-for-tim-burtons-frankenweenie.php|archivedate=February 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Filming===
[[File:Frankenweenie, Victor, Sparky Frankenstein, puppets.jpg|thumb|250px|Puppets of Victor and Sparky displayed at the 2012 [[Fan Expo Canada]]]]
Filming began at [[Three Mills]] Studios in July 2010.<ref>{{cite news | author = Nick de Semlyen | title = Exclusive: The Lion King To Go 3D! | url = http://www.empireonline.com/news/feed.asp?NID=28191 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = June 22, 2010 | accessdate = December 27, 2010}}</ref> The crew created three giant sound stages, including Victor's cluttered family attic, a cemetery exterior, and a high school interior. The sound stages were then divided into 30 separate areas to deal with the handcrafted, frame-by-frame style of filmmaking. Compared to other stop-motion animation sets, ''Frankenweenie''{{'}}s set is much larger. As IGN notes, the main character Sparky had to be "'dog-size' compared to the other human characters, but also large enough to house all the elements of the mechanical skeleton secreted within his various foam and silicon-based incarnation". On the other hand, the mechanics are small and delicate, and in some instances they had to have Swiss watchmakers create the tiny nuts and bolts. Around 200 separate puppets were used, with roughly 18 different versions of Victor. The puppets also have human hair, with 40–45 joints for the human characters and about 300 parts for Sparky.<ref name=IGN>{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Leigh|title=The Magic of Tim Burton's Frankenweenie|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/121/1214658p1.html|accessdate=December 16, 2011|newspaper=IGN|date=December 13, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Babble>{{cite news|title=Tim Burton Brings Frankenweenie Back to Life & We Got to Witness the Resurrection!|url=http://blogs.babble.com/famecrawler/2011/12/14/tim-burton-brings-frankenweenie-back-to-life-we-got-to-witness-the-resurrection/|accessdate=December 16, 2011|newspaper=Babble|date=December 14, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Hollywood.com">{{cite news|last=Hubschman|first=Daniel|title=Frankenweenie Set Visit Report Pt. 1|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Frankenweenie_Set_Visit_Report_Pt_1/10874570|accessdate=December 16, 2011|newspaper=Hollywood.com|date=December 13, 2011}}</ref>
