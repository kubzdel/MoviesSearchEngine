'''''L.A. Zombie''''' is a 2010 [[zombie]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Bruce LaBruce]].<ref>"[http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2009/08/08/Bruce-La-Bruce-shooting-new-zombie-flick-called-LA-ZOMBIE Bruce La Bruce shooting new zombie flick called ''LA ZOMBIE''!]", ''QuietEarth.us''. Retrieved on August 8, 2009.</ref> It premiered in competition at [[Locarno International Film Festival]] in [[Switzerland]] in 2010. The film exists in two versions, a 63-minute cut version showcased at various festivals and theatres and a 103-minute directors cut DVD release containing hardcore gay [[pornography]] not seen in the cut version.

== Plot ==

An [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] zombie (who may just be a [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] vagrant, and whose appearance constantly shifts between that of a corpse, a [[tusk]]ed beast with irregular genitals, and a normal man) emerges from the sea, and begins making its way to [[Los Angeles]]. A motorist notices the zombie walking along a deserted road, picks it up, and dies in an accident moments later. The zombie recovers from the crash, and reanimates the driver by penetrating a wound in the man's chest with its monstrous penis. The ghouls have sex, which ends with the first zombie ejaculating black semen, and stumbling away as the motorist sits among the wreckage of his vehicle, in awe of what had just transpired.

The zombie reaches Los Angeles, and after perusing shopping carts full of discarded objects, ventures to the [[Los Angeles River|L.A. River]], where it sees [[White-collar crime|a white collar criminal]] being shot to death by his partner. The zombie drags the deceased lawbreaker to a soiled mattress, and resurrects him via coitus with the bullet wounds in the man's back. The undead criminal and the zombie have sex, which is followed by the zombie wandering away, washing itself, and going to a [[Coffeehouse|café]], where it purchases a cup of coffee.

The zombie steals some clothing, and finds the dumped body of a gang member who was shot in the head. The zombie brings the hood back to life by molesting the hole in his forehead, and has sex with him. A group of homeless are then shown meeting at an abandoned sofa, but flee when they discover the body of a fellow bum who had [[Drug overdose|overdosed]] in a cardboard box. The zombie stumbles upon the scene, and after ignoring a homeless man who is merely passed out, resurrects and engages in sex with the dead one.

In a [[BDSM]] [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]], four men have an orgy, and later all of them are killed by a pair of drug dealers when they refuse to pay for low-quality [[cocaine]]. The zombie witnesses the massacre through a window, enters the building, and instigates a gory [[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|circle jerk]] after bringing back the shot leathermen. The zombie then goes to a cemetery, cries tears and blood as it reminisces about its lovers, and digs up a grave as it begins to storm.

The film was first released as a soft-core [[Independent film|independent feature]] and then a [[gay pornography|gay pornographic]] film at a later date.

On January 30, 2010, the film had a sneak preview at the Peres Project Exhibit in [[Berlin]], Germany as part of the show ''L.A. Zombie: The Movie That Would Not Die''.<ref>[http://www.peresprojects.com/exhibit-overview/239/5890/ ''LA Zombie'': The Movie That Would Not Die] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128101843/http://peresprojects.com/exhibit-overview/239/5890/ |date=2010-11-28 }} Retrieved on January 30, 2010.</ref> A collection of silk screened portraits by Bruce LaBruce from the film were also shown at the exhibit, mostly pictures showcasing Sagat as a zombie. The [[Locarno International Film Festival]] screened ''L.A. Zombie'' in competition from August 4–16 of 2010.<ref>Vivarelli, Nick (June 23, 2010).

The film was due to have its second and third screening as part of the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] (MIFF) in Australia on the 7th and 8 August 2010. However, the Australian Film Classification Board advised festival organisers that the film could not be screened as it was likely to be refused classification.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/gay-zombie-porn-gets-festival-flick-20100720-10jls.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Paul | last=Kalina | title=Gay zombie porn gets festival flick | date=July 21, 2010}}</ref> Under Australian law, films that are refused classification may not be imported, sold, or distributed, which precludes screening at public events.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/zombie-porn-director-delighted-by-ban-20100721-10k8z.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Michelle | last=Griffin | title=Zombie porn director 'delighted' by ban | date=July 21, 2010}}</ref> In defiance of this censorship, the [[Melbourne Underground Film Festival]], which occurs concurrently with [[Melbourne International Film Festival|MIFF]] but screens films regarded as too controversial for the mainstream event, held an illegal screening of ''L.A.

[[TLA Releasing]] picked up the U.S. release for the film, and set November 12, 2010 as the DVD date.

In [[New Zealand]], the film was first screened at the Out Takes LGBT film festival in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outtakes.org.nz/film/268/la_zombie |title="LA Zombie", ''OutTakes.org'' |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320140212/http://www.outtakes.org.nz/film/268/la_zombie |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}</ref> Unlike Australia, New Zealand's Office of Film and Literature Classification gave the film an R18 certificate, which means that it can be screened as long as the audience is aged eighteen and over.

''[[Fangoria]]'' referred to ''L.A. Zombie'' as a, "strangely introspective indie film," and concluded that it was well done and thoughtful, and that "The joy of the film is that it doesn't do what you expect it to, yet it always seems sincere".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2578:la-zombie-film-review&catid=50:movies-tv&Itemid=181|title = ''L.A. Zombie'' Film Review|last = Oughton|first = Karen|publisher = |date = 9 November 2010|website = Fangoria|accessdate = 26 June 2013}}</ref> Film Forward stated "This sometimes sexy, sometimes chilling horror-porn-art house piece has a strong message, yet it feels like Bruce LaBruce light. There's none of the raw energy that made ''[[The Raspberry Reich]]'' (2004) a revelation, and there's not enough of the thought-provoking, satirical humor that embodied his last one, ''[[Otto; or Up with Dead People]]'' (2008).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://film-forward.com/dvdon-demand/l-a-zombie|title = ''L.A. Zombie''|last = Lee|first = Michael|publisher = |date = 4 October 2011|website = Film Forward|accessdate = 26 June 2013}}</ref> According to ''Variety'', rather than combining art-show, campy horror, and porn movies, Labruce, "just turned out a confused mess," and, "it's hard to imagine regular filmgoers being especially disturbed...only the most sheltered viewers will feel the notoriety is deserved."<ref>Weissberg, Jay (August 6, 2010). "[https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/l-a-zombie-1117943302/# Film Review: ‘L.A. Zombie’]", ''Variety.com''. Accessed December 28, 2014.</ref>

A score of two stars out of five was awarded by Moria, which wrote "One suspects the true purpose behind ''L.A. Zombie'' is that Bruce LaBruce is less a pornographic filmmaker than a gleeful agitator who latches onto pornography solely for its outrage value".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://moria.co.nz/horror/l.a.-zombie-2010.htm|title = ''L.A. Zombie''|last = Scheib|first = Richard|publisher = |date = |website = Moria - The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review|accessdate = 26 June 2013}}</ref> ''Next Projection'' gives the film a 6 out of 10 stars or, "okay," rating.<ref>"[http://nextprojection.com/2014/07/04/skin-flicks-films-bruce-labruce-l-zombie-review/ Skin Flicks: The Films of Bruce LaBruce: L.A. Zombie Review]", ''NextProjection.com''. Accessed December 28, 2014.</ref> The [[Gothamist|Torontoist]] found the film exploitative of L.A.'s homeless, giving it zero stars and beginning its review with "A spiritless, pointless amalgam of gory zombie picture and hardcore porn, ''L.A. Zombie'' is the confluence of two cultural crosscurrents that nobody asked for. Shot on crummy-looking digital and realized by the incompetent Bruce LaBruce, it looks like a homework assignment cranked out by the insufferably pretentious kid in the [[Tom Savini]] master class".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://torontoist.com/2010/09/la_zombie/|title = ''L.A.
