==Reception==
''Belenggu'' received a mixed review from Film Business Asia, who stated that "on a psycho-horror level there's nothing new or inventive here. ''Belenggu'' isn't bad, it's merely routine".<ref name="fba-review" /> [[Twitch Film|Twitch]] gave the film a mixed review, opining that "With a tighter, more adventurous script, there is no doubt that Upi Avianto has the talents behind the camera to deliver an effective thriller of great beauty and dramatic substance. While Belenggu is not that film, it nevertheless makes a confident positive stride towards accomplishing that in the future."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2012/07/pifan-2012-review-belenggu.php|work=[[Twitch Film]]|accessdate=July 26, 2012|date=July 21, 2012|title=PIFAN 2012 Review: Belenggu|author=Marsh, James}}</ref><ref>[http://filmindonesia.or.id/movie/title/lf-b008-13-894822_belenggu {{id icon}} Belenggu synopsis] retrieved on 2012-02-28</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a generally positive review, noting that "Though Elang's backstory is a little too sketchy for a little too long, Avianto's imaginative storytelling and the pic's unsettling visual and aural atmosphere should keep most auds absorbed until the triple-reverse finale."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947939/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Belenggu|accessdate=July 26, 2012|author=Kuiper, Richard|date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>
