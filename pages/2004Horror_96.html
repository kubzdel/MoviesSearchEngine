'''''Saw''''' is a 2004 American [[horror film]]<ref name="VarietyReview"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=12&ti=1,12&Search_Arg=Saw&Search_Code=TALL&CNT=25&PID=x8Cuc4HrUx9R--hShAp_UDaA4t&SEQ=20110817025227&SID=1 |title=Saw.

It is Wan's feature film directorial debut. The screenplay, written by [[Leigh Whannell]], is based on a story by Wan and Whannell. The film stars [[Cary Elwes]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Monica Potter]], [[Michael Emerson]], [[Ken Leung]], [[Tobin Bell]] and [[Leigh Whannell]]. In the film, Elwes and Whannell portray two men who awake to find themselves chained in a large dilapidated bathroom, with one being ordered to kill the other or his family will die. It is the first installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]].

The debut of Wan and Whannell, the screenplay was written in 2001, but after failed attempts to get the script produced in Wan and Whannell's home country of Australia, they were urged to travel to Los Angeles. In order to help attract producers they shot a [[Low-budget film|low-budget]] [[Saw (2003 film)|short film of the same name]] from a scene out of the script. This proved successful in 2003 as producers from [[Evolution Entertainment]] were immediately attached and also formed a horror genre production label [[Twisted Pictures]]. The film was given a small budget and shot for 18 days.

''Saw'' was first screened on January 19, 2004. [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] picked up the rights and released the film in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, but the film gained a [[cult following]]. Compared to its low budget, ''Saw'' performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, one of the most profitable horror films since 1996's ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''. 

The film was theatrically re-released by Lionsgate on October 31, 2014 to celebrate its tenth anniversary.<ref name="IGNAug2014">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/27/saw-returning-to-theaters-for-its-10th-anniversary|title=Saw returning to theatres for its 10th anniversary|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=August 28, 2014|accessdate=August 28, 2014}}</ref>

==Plot ==
Adam, a [[photographer]], awakens in a bathtub in a large dilapidated bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an [[oncologist]], is chained to a pipe across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a [[revolver]] and a [[microcassette]] recorder. Each man finds a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or his wife and daughter will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two [[hacksaw]]s inside a toilet; which they try to use to cut through their chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant to be used for their chains, but for their feet, and identifies their captor as the [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw Killer]], whom Lawrence knows of because he was once a suspect.

[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] show that while Lawrence was discussing the terminal brain cancer of a patient named John Kramer he was approached by Detectives [[David Tapp]] and Steven Sing, who found his [[penlight]] at the scene of a Jigsaw "game". Lawrence's alibi cleared him, but he agreed to view the testimony of the only known survivor of one of Jigsaw's games, a [[heroin]] addict named [[Amanda Young]], who escaped a "reverse bear trap", and believes that Jigsaw helped her.

Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon are being held captive in their home by a man who is watching Adam and Lawrence through a camera hidden behind the bathrooms two-way mirror. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after Amanda's testimony and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from Amanda's game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing was killed by a quadruple shotgun trap while pursuing him. Still convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp continued stalking him after his discharge.

In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box containing two cigarettes, a lighter, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: he was trying to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's poisoned blood to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in his photo development room when the power went out and, after finding [[Billy the Puppet|a puppet]], he was attacked by the same pig-masked figure.  Alison calls Lawrence at gunpoint and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the bag containing the hacksaws. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; who he had visited the night he was abducted. After urging Adam to describe the man who was paying him, Lawrence realizes that it was Tapp. Adam then finds a photo he ''didn't'' take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep, an orderly at his hospital. Unfortunately, the clock strikes six as he realizes this, and Zep moves to kill Alison and Diana.

Alison manages to free herself and fights Zep for the gun, after he calls Lawrence. The struggle gets Tapp's attention, and he saves Alison and Diana and chases Zep to the sewers, where he is eventually shot in the chest after a brief struggle. Lawrence, aware only of gunshots and screaming, is electrically shocked as well and loses reach of the phone. In desperation, he saws off his foot and shoots Adam with the corpse's revolver. Zep enters the bathroom to kill Lawrence because it is "the rules", but Adam, who only suffered a flesh wound, overpowers Zep and bludgeons him to death with the toilet tank lid. As Lawrence crawls out of the room to find help, Adam searches Zep's body for a key and finds another microcassette recorder, which reveals that Zep was another victim following rules in order to obtain an antidote for a slow-acting poison in his body. As the tape ends, the "corpse" rises and is revealed to be Lawrence's patient John Kramer, the real Jigsaw killer. He reveals that the key to Adam's chain was in the bathtub he woke up in, which went down the drain when Adam first woke up. Adam attempts to shoot John with Zep's gun, but John activates a remote control, shocking Adam. John then shuts off the lights, and slams the door shut, leaving Adam to die right before telling him "Game Over".

===Development and writing===
[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|Wan (left) and Whannell (right).]]
After finishing film school, Australian director [[James Wan]] and Australian writer [[Leigh Whannell]] wanted to write and fund a film.<ref name="AVClub">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/saw-creators-leigh-whannell-and-james-wan,46975/ |title=Saw creators Leigh Whannell and James Wan |last=Tobias |first=Scott |work=[[The A.V.

Another film that inspired them to finance the film themselves was [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s ''[[Pi (film)|Pi]]''.<ref name="FangoriaPg50">{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Sarah|journal=[[Fangoria]]|title=Saw Cuts Deep|issn=0164-2111|number=236|date=September 2004|pages=50}}</ref> The two thought the cheapest script to shoot would involve two actors in one room.<ref name="SawRevisted" /> Whannell said, "So I actually think the restrictions we had on our bank accounts at the time, the fact that we wanted to keep the film contained, helped us come up with the ideas in the film."<ref name="IGNpg1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/561/561009p1.html |title=Interview: James Wan and Leigh Whannell |last=Otto |first=Jeff |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[News Corporation]] |page=1 |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zpQdWTQ?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/561/561009p1.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>  One idea was to have the entire film set with two actors stuck in an elevator and being shot in the point of view of security cameras.<ref name="SawRevisted" />

Wan pitched the idea to Whannell of two men chained to opposite sides of a bathroom with a dead body in the middle of the floor and they are trying to figure out why and how they are there. By the end of the film they realize the person lying on the floor is not dead and he is the reason they are locked in the room. Whannell initially did not give Wan the reaction he was looking for. He said, "I'll never forget that day. I remember hanging up the phone and started just going over it in my head, and without any sort of long period of pondering, I opened my diary that I had at the time and wrote the word 'Saw'."<ref name="SawRevisted" /> Before instantaneously writing the word "Saw" in a blood-red, dripping font, the two had not come up with a title. "It was one of those moments that made me aware that some things just really are meant to be. Some things are just waiting there to be discovered," Whannell said.<ref name="SawRevisted" />

The character of [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw]] did not come until months later, when Whannell was working at a job he was unhappy with and began having migraines. Convinced it was a [[brain tumor]],<ref name="TheArrowWhannell" /> he went to a [[neurology|neurologist]] to have an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] and while sitting nervously in the waiting room he thought, "What if you were given the news that you had a tumor and you were going to die soon? How would you react to that?"<ref name="AVClub" />  He imagined the character Jigsaw having been given one or two years to live and combined that with the idea of Jigsaw putting others in a literal version of the situation, but only giving them a few minutes to choose their fate.<ref name="AVClub" />

Wan did not intend to make a "[[Splatter film|torture porn]]" film as the script only had one short segment of "torture." He said the film "played out like a mystery thriller." It was not until the [[Saw (franchise)|sequel]]s that the plot focused more on torture scenes.<ref name="AVClub" />

===Funding===
Whannell and Wan initially had $30,000 to spend on the film, but as the script developed it was clear that more funds would be needed.<ref name="FangoriaPg50" /> The script was optioned by a producer in [[Sydney]] for a year but the deal eventually fell through.<ref name="SawRevisted" /> After other failed attempts to get the script produced in Australia from 2001 to 2002,<ref name="AVClub" /> literary agent Ken Greenblat read the script and suggested they travel to [[Los Angeles]], where their chances of finding an interested studio were greater.<ref name="SMH">{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/23/1100972389306.html |title=They came, Saw, conquered |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=November 24, 2004 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zpFqHU1?url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/23/1100972389306.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Wan and Whannell initially refused, due to lack of traveling funds but the pair's agent, Stacey Testro, convinced them to go.<ref name="SMH" />  In order to help studios take interest in the script, Whannell provided A$5,000 (US$5,000) to make a seven-minute short film based on the script's jaw trap scene, which they thought would prove most effective. Whannell played David, the man wearing the Reverse Bear Trap. Working at the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], Whannell and Wan knew cameramen who were willing to provide technical assistance for the short.<ref name="IGNpg2">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/561/561009p2.html |title=Interview: James Wan and Leigh Whannell |last=Otto |first=Jeff |work=IGN |publisher=News Corporation |page=2 |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zpTgpsL?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/561/561009p2.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

Whannell wanted to play the lead character in the feature film. The short helped show that Wan and Whannell was a "director-actor team" rather than just wanting to sell the script.

On taking the role of Jigsaw, Bell said - "I did ''Saw'' because I thought it was a fascinating location for a film to be made. These guys locked in a room, to me, was fresh.

Every day, it was me fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very [[Hitchcockian]] style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," Wan said about the very short shooting schedule.<ref name="AVClub" /> He said the style instead ended up being "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.<ref name="AVClub" />

In post-production, Wan found he did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was basically shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor [[Kevin Greutert]] created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. "We did a lot of things to fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever we cut to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or we cut to surveillance cameras, or we cut to [[Unit still photographer|still photography]] within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," he explained.<ref name="AVClub" />

The soundtrack was released on {{nowrap|October 5, 2004}} by [[Koch Records]]. Johnny Loftus of [[Allmusic]] gave it three out of five stars. He said that Clouser "really nails it with his creaky, clammy score" and that he "understands that ''Saw''{{'s}} horror only works with a heady amount of camp, and he draws from industrial music in the same way." He particularly liked, "Cigarette"; "Hello, Adam"; and "F**k This S*!t," commenting that they "blend chilling sounds with harsh percussion and deep-wound keyboard stabs."<ref name="AllMusicReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r710182|title=Saw (Original) Motion Picture Soundtrack|last= Loftus|first=Johnny|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[All Media Guide]]|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>

Critical reception to ''Saw'' was mixed. On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 49%, based on 181 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Saw'' is more than nasty enough for genre junkies, but far too twisted, gory, and shallow for more discerning horror fans."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw/| title=''Saw'' (2004)| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] | accessdate = November 3, 2014}}</ref> Metacritic gave the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.metacritic.com/movie/saw| title= Saw Reviews | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = October 28, 2014}}</ref>

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review after its Sundance premiere. He called it a "crude concoction sewn together from the severed parts of prior horror/serial killer pics."  He called the screenplay "convoluted," criticizing the use of "flashbacks within flashbacks" and [[red herring]]s. He described the film as being "too hyperbolic to be genuinely disturbing."<ref name="VarietyReview">{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922951.html |title=Sundance Review |last=Harvey |first=Dennis |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=January 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zmd5321?url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117922951/ |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Carla Meyer of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film a positive review saying the film "combined B-movie acting with a twisted mind-set and visual tricks designed to camouflage cheap effects" and that it was "terrifying at some moments and insinuatingly creepy at many others." She called the killing scenes "amazingly evocative for such a low-budget movie."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/10/29/DDGRB9HIGS1.DTL |title=Cheap Thrills Sharpen Grisly 'Saw' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] |date=October 29, 2004 |first=Carla |last=Meyer |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60zyVCsBh?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F29%2FDDGRB9HIGS1.DTL&type=movies |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'s}} [[Kim Newman]] gave the film four out of five stars. He said ''Saw'' is styled like early [[David Fincher]] films and "boasts an intricate structure - complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have come to this crisis - and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia." He ended his review saying, "As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we've had lately."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10234 |title=Saw |last=Newman |first=Kim |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |date=April 1, 2006 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6101I9l5f?url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10234 |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>  [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B minus, calling it "derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good."  He described Jigsaw's intent as "to show you the serial killer lurking inside yourself." Gleiberman criticized Elwes' performance by saying, "[Elwes] ought to be featured in a seminar on the perils of [[overacting]]."<ref name="EWReview">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,734839,00.html |title=Saw Review |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |authorlink=Owen Gleiberman |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6103ai5v8?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,734839,00.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> [[Daniel M.

''[[The New York Times]]''{{'s}} [[Stephen Holden]] gave a mixed review saying the film "does a better-than-average job of conveying the panic and helplessness of men terrorized by a sadist in a degrading environment, but it is still not especially scary. What sets its demon apart from run-of-the-mill movie serial killers is his impulse to humiliate and torture his victims and justify it with some twisted morality." He said the film is "seriously undermined by the half-baked, formulaic detective story in which the horror is framed."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/movies/29saw.html |title=A Gore Fest, With Overtones of Iraq and TV |last=Holden |first=Stephen |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=October 29, 2004 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6104saqaX?url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/movies/29saw.html |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also gave the film a mixed review saying, "''Saw'' is so full of twists it ends up getting snarled. For all of his flashy engineering and inventive torture scenarios, the Jigsaw Killer comes across as an amateur. [[Hannibal Lecter]] would have him for lunch." She said the film "carelessly underscores its own shaky narrative at every turn with its mid-budget hokiness." She also noted that Elwes and Whannell had trouble keeping an American accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/29/entertainment/et-saw29 |title='Saw' would work better if sharpened |last=Chocano |first=Carina |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=October 29, 2004 |accessdate=August 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6105d4c6d?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/oct/29/entertainment/et-saw29 |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Another mixed review came from [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and lamented the gimmicks and plot contrivances but nonetheless described ''Saw'' as "well made and acted, and does what it does about as well as it could be expected to."<ref>[[Roger Ebert]] (2004) "[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/saw-2004 Saw]", accessed 10 April 2013</ref>

===Comparisons to ''Seven'' (1995)===
When asked if the 1995 thriller film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' was an inspiration to ''Saw'', Whannell said "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, ''Seven'' is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt ''Seven'' was that close to our film. I guess if you stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo ''Seven''. What we always liked about ''Saw'', though, was the fact that the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see."<ref name="TheArrowWhannell" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''{{'s}} Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to ''Seven'' saying, "In a blatant imitation of ''Seven'', ''Saw'' features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing."<ref name="EWReview" /> Richard J. Leskosky of [[Champaign–Urbana metropolitan area|Champaign-Urbana]]'s ''The News-Gazette'' said "''Saw'' wants to be taken as another ''Seven''. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film."<ref>{{cite news|title=Improbable ' Saw ' surprises, but still not worth a see |last=J. Leskosky|first=Richard|work=The News-Gazette|location=[[Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area|Champaign-Urbana]], [[Illinois|IL]]|date=November 4, 2004}}</ref>

===Accolades===
[[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film tenth in its list of the Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade, with the article calling ''Saw'' "perhaps the most influential horror film of the decade, which kick-started a franchise.... In light of its measly $1.2 million price tag the film's quality relative to bigger-budget horror films is striking. It also takes itself seriously, which came as a breath of fresh air following the trend of wimpy tongue-in-cheek horror that had dominated the multiplexes post-''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''. More than anything, this twisted morality tale is a film made by horror fans, for horror fans; it's gory, it's depraved, and best of all it introduced a new horror icon in Jigsaw."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18425 |title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 3 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |publisher=The Collective |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=January 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6102xUPeH?url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18425 |archivedate=August 17, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' listed the film number 14 on their Top 100 list that defined the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6501160/Top-100-movies-defining-the-noughties-00s-in-film.html |title=The films that defined the noughties |last=Gritten |first=David |last2=Robey |first2=Tim |last3=Sandhu |first3=Sukhdev |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=November 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/612zpLrlX?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6501160/Top-100-movies-defining-the-noughties-00s-in-film.html |archivedate=August 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>
