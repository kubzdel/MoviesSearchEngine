'''''Attack the Block''''' is a 2011 British [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[comedy horror]] film written and directed by [[Joe Cornish]] and starring [[John Boyega]], [[Nick Frost]], [[Jodie Whittaker]], and [[Luke Treadaway]]. It was the film debut of Cornish, Boyega, and composer [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]].

The film centres on a teenage [[street gang]] who have to defend themselves from predatory [[alien invader]]s on a [[Council house|council estate]] in [[South London]] on [[Guy Fawkes Night]]. Released on 11 May 2011, it underperformed at the box office yet received favourable critical reviews and accolades internationally.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Plot==
{{original research section|date=December 2017}}
Walking home on [[Bonfire Night]], Samantha Adams ([[Jodie Whittaker]]), a 25-year-old trainee [[nurse]], is mugged by a small gang of teenage hoodlums: Pest ([[Alex Esmail]]); Dennis ([[Franz Drameh]]); Jerome ([[Leeon Jones]]); Biggz (Simon Howard); and leader Moses ([[John Boyega]]). The attack is interrupted when a [[meteorite]] falls from the sky into a nearby car, giving Samantha the chance to escape. As Moses searches the wreck of the car for valuables, his face is scratched by a pale, hairless, eyeless dog-sized creature; the object which fell from the sky was its [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]. The creature runs away, but the gang chase and kill it. Hoping to gain fame and fortune, they take the corpse to their acquaintance, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] dealer Ron ([[Nick Frost]]), to get advice on what to do. He lives at the top of their [[tower block]], Wyndham Tower.

Moses asks Ron and his boss, Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter), to keep the creature in their fortified "[[cannabis|weed]] room" while he decides how to proceed. More objects fall from the sky. Eager to fight the creatures, the gang arm themselves and go to the nearest crash site. However, they find these aliens are much larger, with spiky fur which is so black it reflects no light, huge claws and rows of [[Bioluminescence|glowing]] fangs. The aliens kill their dog too. Fleeing the aliens, the gang are intercepted by two policemen and Moses is arrested, identified as the mugger by Samantha. The aliens, following Moses, maul the unarmed officers to death and attack their van, leaving Samantha and Moses trapped inside. Dennis reaches the vehicle and drives the police van away, only to crash into a surprised Hi-Hatz's car. Samantha runs away while the rest of Moses's gang catch up and confront Hi-Hatz and his henchman

Enraged by the damage to his car, Hi-Hatz threatens them with a gun, refusing to believe their story of aliens, until his henchman is attacked by one, allowing the gang to escape. The gang try to flee to Wyndham Tower but are again followed and attacked en route by the aliens, where Biggz is forced to hide in a recycling bin and Pest is severely bitten in the leg. They find that Samantha lives in their building, force their way into her flat, and persuade her to treat Pest's leg. An alien bursts in and Moses kills it with a [[samurai sword]] through the head. Understanding that the group was not lying about the creatures being extraterrestrial, Samantha reasons that it is safer to stay with the gang than on her own and joins them. The gang moves upstairs to the flat owned by Tia (Danielle Vitalis), Dimples ([[Paigey Cakey|Paige Meade]]), Dionna (Gina Antwi), and Gloria (Natasha Jonas), believing that their security gate will keep them safe. The aliens instead attack from outside, climbing up the side of the tower block and smashing through the windows, one of whom decapitates Dennis.

After Samantha saves Moses' life from one of the aliens, the girls believe them to be the focus of the creatures and kick them out of the flat. In the hall, the gang are attacked by Hi-Hatz and more henchmen. The gang escapes while an alien chases Hi-Hatz and a couple of henchmen into a lift. Hi-Hatz kills the alien, although his henchmen are killed, and continues his search for Moses. Making their way upstairs to Ron's weed room, the gang runs into more aliens, but using fireworks as a distraction, they manage to get through. Jerome, however, becomes disoriented in the smoke and is killed by an alien. Entering Ron's flat they find that Hi-Hatz is already there and has been waiting for them. Hi-Hatz prepares to shoot Moses but hordes of aliens smash through the window and kill him. Now joined by Brewis ([[Luke Treadaway]]), one of Ron's customers, Moses, Pest and Samantha retreat into the weed room, while Ron hides in the flat.

Biggz, still trapped in the bin by a lurking alien, is saved by two unruly children, Probs (Sammy Williams) and Mayhem (Michael Ajao), using a water-gun filled with petrol and a flame to torch the creature from a safe distance. In the weed room, Brewis notices a luminescent stain on Moses' jacket under the [[ultraviolet]] light. As a zoology student, Brewis theorises that the aliens are like [[spore]]s, [[Panspermia|drifting through space]] on [[solar wind]]s until they chance on a [[Habitable planet|suitable planet]]. After landing in an area with enough food, the female lets off a strong [[pheromone]] which will attract the male creatures to it so that they can mate and propagate their species in their new world. Brewis suggests that the smaller, hairless alien which Moses killed in the beginning was such a female, and it had left a mating scent on Moses that the larger male aliens have been tracking throughout the evening. The gang form a plan for Samantha, who has not been stained with the pheromone, to go to Moses's flat and turn on the gas oven.

Moses forces Pest to return the ring they stole from her, feeling guilty for having mugged her. Samantha successfully avoids the aliens, turns on the gas, and leaves the block. Moses, with the dead female alien strapped to his back, rushes out of the weed room and into his flat, while the males converge on the scent and chase Moses through the block. Inside his flat he throws the female into the kitchen and the males follow. Using fireworks, Moses ignites the gas-filled room and leaps out of the window. The explosion engulfs the flat and the aliens, but Moses survives, clinging to a [[Union Jack]] hanging from the side of the building. In the aftermath, Moses, Pest, Brewis, and Ron are arrested and held responsible for the deaths around the block, including the two officers who had earlier arrested Moses. Samantha, however, comes to their defence. In the back of the police van, Moses and Pest hear the residents of the block cheering for Moses.

==Cast==
Representative of the film's plot and location, most of the cast were young, relative unknowns, and local to the area. According to the DVD's making-of featurette, the teenagers were selected from drama classes of London council estate schools, and then had to go through eight auditions before being offered a part.<ref>DVD "making of" featurette</ref> John Boyega found out about this film from an ad placed on the internet. The cast includes:

* [[Jodie Whittaker]] as Samantha Adams, a trainee nurse and new resident of the block (Wyndham Tower).
* [[John Boyega]] as Moses, a quiet and loyal teenage gang leader and orphan looking for respect around the block.
* [[Alex Esmail]] as Pest, a teenage jokester and member of the gang. 
* [[Franz Drameh]] as Dennis, a hotheaded [[pizza delivery boy]] and the brashest member of the gang.
* [[Leeon Jones]] as Jerome, a schoolboy and the smartest member of the gang. 
* Simon Howard as Biggz, the youngest member of the gang. Throughout most of the film, Biggz is trapped in a dumpster after he's cornered by the aliens.
* [[Luke Treadaway]] as Brewis, a student stoner and one of Ron's customers.
* [[Nick Frost]] as Ron, the local drug dealer who lives in the penthouse of the block and knows everyone.
* Jumayn Hunter as Hi-Hatz, Ron's feared boss and the local psychopathic gangster of the block.

==Production==
[[Big Talk Productions#Big Talk Pictures|Big Talk Pictures]], known for films including ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'', and ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. The World]]'', produced the film alongside [[Film4 Productions|Film4]], [[UK Film Council|The UK Film Council]], and [[StudioCanal]].<ref name= "BFI">{{cite web |title=Attack the Block|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b8dd444e3 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref>

The plot was inspired by an event where the director was mugged himself, and after adding the science fiction angle into the plot, Joe Cornish interviewed various kids in youth groups in order to find out what kind of weapons they would use if a real alien invasion occurred. Cornish also based the character of the [[stoner (drug user)|stoner]] Brewis on himself in his twenties.

===Filming===
''Attack the Block'' is set in a fictional neighbourhood said in-film to be located in the [[London]] district of [[Brixton]]. It is actually a composite of various council estates across London. Director Cornish explains:
<blockquote>
We wanted to stamp a clear layout on the audience's minds early, and since we couldn't afford to show an aerial shot of the estate as it doesn't exist, the way to show it was by showing this top shot of the map at the very beginning of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Location |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/location-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block Minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
</blockquote>
The name Wyndham Estates appears on the left of the entrance to the fictional block, referencing the English science-fiction writer [[John Wyndham]]. The science fiction writer [[J. G. Ballard]] is also referenced by one of the street names; Ballard wrote a number of novels set in large urban blocks. The film was shot across London from March to May 2010, with 6 weeks of night shoots<ref>{{cite web|title=The Look |url=http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |work=Attack the Block minisite |publisher=Film 4 |accessdate=28 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212045710/http://www.film4.com/features/article/the-look-attack-the-block |archivedate=12 December 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> on the [[Heygate Estate]] in [[Elephant and Castle]]; Myatts Field, Brixton; [[Oval tube station|Oval Underground station]] and the Bemerton Estate in [[Islington]]. Interior scenes were filmed at [[Three Mills Studios]] in [[Newham]], part of the [[East End of London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Clients|url=http://www.3mills.com/our-clients-current-and-recent-credits.html|publisher=3Mills|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref>

===Creature effects===
The creatures began with two men in gorilla-like suits with [[animatronic]] jaws; [[post-production]] added the unearthly qualities such as the spiky fur which doesn't reflect any light, the claws, the rows of [[bioluminescent]] jaws, and even some of their movement. In total the film features over 100 effects shots, which were completed over the course of 4 months by Swedish effects house, Fido.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3dworldmag.com/2011/06/09/creating-the-monsters-of-attack-the-block/#null|title=3D World magazine - Creative Bloq|publisher=}}</ref> The creatures have no eyes, and hunt and find mates using an extremely evolved sense of smell; their movement is enabled mainly through echolocation. According to the DVD commentary, the echolocation noises made by the creatures were a combination of [[dolphin]] [[sonar]] mixed digitally with the grunts and snarls of dozens of other animals, and even a woman screaming.<ref>DVD commentary track {{specify|date=February 2014}}<!-- time stamp? --></ref> Some [[puppet]]s were used, such as the smaller, hairless female alien which terrified the young cast.
