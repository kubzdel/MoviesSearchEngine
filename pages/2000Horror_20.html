'''''Camp Blood 2''''' is a 2000 horror film, and sequel to ''[[Camp Blood]]''. The film was directed by [[Brad Sykes]] and produced by [[David S. Sterling]]. It was followed in 2005 by ''Within the Woods''.

==Plot==
Some time after the events of the [[Camp Blood|first movie]] film maker Worthy Milligan decides to shoot a film based upon the murders and hires Tricia, the traumatized sole survivor of the massacre, as a technical advisor. However, once Tricia, Milligan and the rest of the cast and crew trek into the woods, the nightmare becomes all too real as the clown reappears and begins to butcher the hapless crew members.

After most of the cast and crew have been killed over, Tricia is captured by the killer who reveals herself to be Adrienne, who is the sister of Harris, the perpetrator of the original killings, who blames Tricia for the death of Harris. As the two wrestle, Tricia uses a lighter to set the gasoline soaked Adrienne on fire. During their final struggle, Tricia retrieves Adrienne's machete and slashes her neck open. Adrienne gives Tricia her mask before she dies of her wounds and Tricia flees carrying the mask and machete.

==Reception==
''Digital Retribution'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "Boring, pretentious, pompous and featuring a disappearing clown on fire, there's little reason to watch this. Actually, the only reason to watch is that glorious quote about juice and killer clowns, and since you've already read it, there's now no reason to waste your time on this dreck."<ref name="digitalreview">{{cite web|last1=B.|first1=Devon|title=Camp Blood 2 DVD Review|url=http://www.digital-retribution.com/reviews/dvd/0342.php|website=Digital Retribution.com|publisher=Devon B.|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref>
