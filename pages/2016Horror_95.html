== Synopsis ==
Unable to solve the onslaught of missing children in their town, Police Officers Dave Kane (Darin Foltz) and Paul Sharp (Darren Barcomb) lure former officer Jeremy Duffin (A.J. Leslie) out of his self exposed exile following the murder of his wife and the abduction of his daughter at the hands of Krampus (Ben Berlin). After much debate and with the hopes of finding his daughter, Duffin reluctantly agrees to track the monster and is accompanied by his hulking woodsman friend Monk (Johnny Stevenson). Once back to civilization, Duffin, Monk, Kane, and Sharp are joined by cops Gil Farabee (Rich Goteri), Harry Sharp (Michael Mili)  and Lori Taylor (Tiffany Fest). The quest to find Krampus and the children is further complicated by run-ins with tough guy Stuart (R.A. Mihailoff) and his gang consisting of Natasha (Melantha Blackthorn), T.J. (Bill Kennedy), Trevor (Bill James) and Rick (Arturo Rivera)....along with a nasty Santa Clause (Paul Ferm).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.morehorror.com/krampus-the-devil-returns-review|title=Krampus: The Devil Returns Review}}</ref>

Krampus 2: The Devil Returns received mixed reviews from notable horror web-sites and platforms. Culturecrypt.com gave the film zero stars, stating that "Anyone on your naughty list should be forced to watch this execrable excuse for a movie."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/krampus-2-the-devil-returns|title=KRAMPUS 2: THE DEVIL RETURNS|work=CULTURE CRYPT|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}</ref>  Morehorror.com reviewed the film favorably though, with Jesse Miller writing that "I rather enjoyed my time with Krampus 2 and I believe it’s because it knows exactly what it is – a low budget hybrid beast of ideas that all seem to gel together to create a feature that goes down smashingly."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.morehorror.com/krampus-the-devil-returns-review|title='Krampus: The Devil Returns' (2016) Review {{!}} More Horror|website=www.morehorror.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref> Ben Spurling of Horrornews.net chimed in with "The script, as in most micro-budget horror movies, is a bit muddled and isn’t clarified any by sluggish direction and listless editing. There are a few twists thrown in, one rather surprising and distasteful, and a couple of almost adequate scenes of the police skulking through falling snow in search of their prey; but still, the final completed product is strictly small change and only for the Killer Christmas completest."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/114936/film-review-krampus-the-christmas-devil-returns-2016/|title=Film Review: Krampus The Christmas Devil Returns (2016) {{!}} HNN|website=horrornews.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref> The-other-view.com also gave the film a mixed review but said this of the twist ending: "With any bad film, especially one with a “twist”, I’d have spoiled it without as much as a care. However, I’ll jump the gun and say that with “Krampus: The Devil Returns”, it needs to be seen to be believed, especially if you’re aware of the events from the first film. I honestly did not see that one coming!" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-other-view.com/krampus2.html|title=Krampus: The Devil Returns DVD Review {{!}} The Other View - Entertainment site for gaming, movies, and technology|last=View|first=The Other|website=www.the-other-view.com|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref> Overall, Krampus 2: The Devil Returns currently holds a 27% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Krampus: The Devil Returns|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/krampus_the_devil_returns|language=en|accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref>
