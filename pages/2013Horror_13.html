Lisa Templeton begins a new job as a cleaner at High Hopes Hospital, a mental institution in Amityville, Long Island.

Intimidated by staff and the psychotic ramblings of the patients, she is further unnerved by apparent super natural occurrences on the night shift. To preserve her sanity, Lisa must uncover the mysterious history of the institution and its inmates.
