'''''I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House''''' is a 2016 American-Canadian [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Oz Perkins|Osgood Perkins]].  It stars [[Ruth Wilson]] as a live-in nurse who suspects her elderly employer's house may be haunted.  It premiered at the 2016 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released worldwide on [[Netflix]] on October 28.

== Plot ==
Retired horror author Iris Blum suffers from [[dementia]] and lives in a remote New England house built in the early 19th century. Ms. Blum's estate manager, Mr. Waxcap, hires live-in nurse Lily Saylor to care for her. In a [[voice-over]] Lily explains that she just turned 28 years old, and that she will never reach 29 years old. Lily declares that a house with a death in it can never be bought or sold; it can only be "borrowed" from its ghosts. She notes that Ms. Blum's house was built by one man for his new bride, though the couple mysteriously vanished on their wedding day, leaving the home unfurnished.

Lily begins to experience strange events. On her first night in the house, while having a conversation with a friend, the telephone is wrenched out of her hands by an unseen force. A spot of black mold appears on a section of wall and slowly grows as the months pass. Lily often finds a corner of the rug at the base of the stairs has been flipped up, but she is the only person in the house who walks on the first floor. Ms. Blum only calls Lily "Polly," never using her real name. Mr. Waxcap explains that Polly Parsons is the protagonist of Ms. Blum's most popular novel, ''The Lady in the Walls.'' Lily presses him about how the novel ends, but he says she must read it herself. Lily responds that she is easily scared, and cannot bring herself to read it. Later, Lily opens a copy of the book in Ms. Blum's study, and it has a dried chrysanthemum pressed between the pages. Upon reading the first few pages, Lily discovers that the plot of the novel revolves around the point of Ms. Blum having known Polly during her lifetime, and is retelling her story. A flashback depicts a woman in white wearing a black blindfold, presumably Polly, walking through the empty house. A man wearing a suit can be seen in the other room, his distinguishing features hidden from the frame. Lily sets the book back on the shelf, too frightened to continue.

While rinsing berries in the kitchen, black mold spots cover Lily's hands and arms. Upon closer inspection, she realizes her arms have become noticeably bloated and have turned to a sickly grey color. Ms. Blum calls for Lily, which momentarily distracts her from her arms, and when she looks back at them, they are normal again. Later that evening, while turning the channel dial on the television set, she spots the reflection of a figure dressed in white standing in the archway of the room. When she turns around, no one is there.

Lily discovers a cardboard box accruing mold, hidden away in the shelf of a closet. She takes the box to her bedroom and uses a pair of scissors to cut the tape. The box contains an assortment of handwritten notes, presumably rough drafts for Ms. Blum's novel. Lily comes to believe that Ms. Blum's novel may not be fictitious, but rather rooted in reality, depicting an actual murder committed in the house. The flashback sequence continues. Polly, dressed in a wedding gown and blindfolded, uses her hands to feel her surroundings, coming across a section of the wall that has been stripped of its boards - the same section where mold is growing in the present day. Polly raises her blindfold to investigate and sees the hole, locking eyes with her husband in confusion. Her husband suddenly rushes towards her with a hammer raised above his head, and bludgeons her to death. The man, now covered in blood, hammers the boards back into place, hiding Polly's body in the walls. 

In the present, Lily brushes Ms. Blum's hair, discussing the book with her. Ms. Blum addresses and converses with Lily as if she is Polly. Ms. Blum grows angry with Lily, explaining that she feels betrayed and abandoned, stating that even the prettiest of things eventually rot, and that she will "fall apart like flowers."

Later in the evening, Lily watches television in her bedroom. A ghostly apparition of Polly visits Ms. Blum, whispering in her ear. Lily hears a metallic clang, followed by a rhythmic banging sound. She exits her bedroom and descends the stairs to investigate. She finds the wall boards removed and piled beside the moldy wall. During her investigation, Lily suddenly encounters Polly's ghost, and dies of a shock-induced heart attack. Polly's ghost lingers near the opening in the wall, staring at the camera. 

The following morning, Mr. Waxcap discovers Lilly's body. Because Ms. Blum never received visitors, she too dies. An ambulance removes the bodies, and Mr. Waxcap makes preparations to sell the house. A new family moves into the house, unaware of its history or ghostly occupants. The camera focuses on a ghostly apparition resembling Lily, who refers to herself as the "pretty thing you are looking at".

== Production ==
Writer-director Osgood Perkins originally intended for the story to be about the daughter of a male horror novelist, but he said that "one day, it just changed".<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/09/11/tiff-ruth-wilson-osgood-perkins-pretty-thing|title=TIFF: How director Osgood Perkins dreamed up the chilling I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House|last=Collis|first=Clark|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2016-09-12|accessdate=2016-09-19}}</ref>  Casting became easier once the film was financed; Perkins cited Wilson's talent and excitement for the project as two of the reasons she was chosen to play Lily.  Prentiss – a family friend who, as well as her husband [[Richard Benjamin]], had performed with Perkins' father, [[Anthony Perkins]] – was the director's only choice to play Iris.<ref name=ew/>
