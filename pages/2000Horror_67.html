'''''Scream 3''''' is a 2000 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Wes Craven]] and written by [[Ehren Kruger]]. It stars [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Matt Keeslar]], [[Jenny McCarthy]], [[Emily Mortimer]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Deon Richmond]], and [[Patrick Warburton]]. Released as the third installment in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' franchise]], it was the concluding chapter of the series until the franchise was revived in 2011 with a sequel, ''[[Scream 4]]''.

The film takes place three years after the [[Scream 2|previous film]] and follows [[Sidney Prescott]] (Campbell), who has gone into self-imposed isolation following the events of the previous two films but is drawn to [[Hollywood]] after a new [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] begins killing the cast of the [[film within a film]] ''Stab 3''.  ''Scream 3'' combines the violence of the slasher genre with comedy and "[[whodunit]]" mystery, while satirizing the [[cliché]] of [[Film trilogy|film trilogies]]. Unlike the previous ''Scream'' films, there was an increased emphasis on comedic elements in this installment, and the violence and horror were reduced in response to increased public scrutiny about violence in media, following the [[Columbine High School massacre]].

''Scream'' screenwriter Kevin Williamson provided a five-page outline for two sequels to ''Scream'' when auctioning his original script, hoping to entice bidders with the potential of buying a franchise.  Williamson's commitments to other projects meant he was unable to develop a complete script for ''Scream 3'', so writing duties were undertaken by Kruger, who discarded many of Williamson's notes. Craven and [[Marco Beltrami]] returned to direct and score the film, respectively. Production was troubled with script rewrites, occasions when pages were only ready on the day of filming, and scheduling difficulties with the main cast. Principal photography took place from July to September 1999, and the ending was refilmed in January 2000.

''Scream 3'' premiered on February 3, 2000, in [[Westwood, California]], and was released at theaters the following day, grossing $89.1 million in the US and $161.8 million worldwide. It has a 36% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], whose critical consensus says that the film had become precisely what ''Scream'' originally spoofed.

==Plot==
[[List of Scream characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]], now living in Los Angeles and the host of a nationally syndicated television show, ''100% Cotton'', is called by [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]], who demands the whereabouts of [[Sidney Prescott]], who has gone into hiding [[Scream 2|in the aftermath of the Windsor College murders.]] Cotton refuses to cooperate, and when Ghostface comes to his home, Cotton and his girlfriend [[List of Scream characters#Christine|Christine]] are murdered.

Detective [[List of Scream characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]] contacts [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]] to discuss the murders, prompting her to travel to [[Hollywood]], where she finds [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]] working as an adviser on the set of ''Stab 3'', the third film in the [[film within a film]] series based on the Ghostface murders. Using a [[voice changer]] as a ruse, Ghostface kills ''Stab 3'' actress [[List of Scream characters#Sarah Darling|Sarah Darling]]. Meanwhile, Sidney, haunted by the endless string of brutal murders, is now living in seclusion as a [[crisis intervention|crisis counselor]] for an abused women's [[hotline]], fearing that another killer may strike. Having discovered Sidney's number, the killer begins taunting her by phone, forcing her out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood. As the remaining ''Stab 3'' cast, along with Dewey and Gale, gather at the home of [[List of Scream characters#Jennifer Jolie|Jennifer Jolie]], Ghostface murders her bodyguard and uses a gas leak to cause an explosion, killing fellow actor [[List of Scream characters#Tom Prinze|Tom Prinze]] in the process.

[[List of Scream characters#Martha Meeks|Martha Meeks]], the sister of Sidney's friend [[List of Scream characters#Randy Meeks|Randy]], who was murdered in the previous film, visits Sidney and the others to drop off a videotape that Randy had made before his death, posthumously warning them that the rules of a horror film franchise in the third and final film do not apply to anyone, and that any of them, including the main character (Sidney), could die.

Dewey, Gale, Jennifer, and the remaining ''Stab 3'' cast, [[List of Scream characters#Angelina Tyler|Angelina]] and [[List of Scream characters#Tyson Fox|Tyson]], attend a birthday party for ''Stab 3'''s director [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]], where Ghostface strikes. Gale discovers Roman's seemingly dead body in the basement. Angelina, refusing to stick with Gale and Jennifer, wanders off alone before she is murdered. Tyson attempts to fight Ghostface but the killer manages to wound him before throwing him off a balcony to his death. Jennifer tries to escape through a secret passage, but Ghostface kills her. The killer then orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey, who are being held hostage. When she arrives, Ghostface forces Sidney to remove her firearm and lures her inside, as Gale and Dewey are bound and gagged with duct tape. As Sidney is untying Gale and Dewey, Ghostface appears, though Sidney gains the upper hand using a second hidden gun to fight off Ghostface. Detective Kincaid shows up but is knocked unconscious by Ghostface.

Sidney flees and hides in a secret screening room where she encounters Ghostface. He reveals himself as Roman, having faked his death and survived being shot due to a [[bulletproof vest]]. Roman admits to being Sidney's half-brother, born to their mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]] when she was an actress in Hollywood. Years ago, he had unsuccessfully tried reuniting with her. Bitter over the rejection, Roman would film all the men she philandered with. He showed [[List of Scream characters#Billy Loomis|Billy Loomis]] the footage of his father with Maureen, which motivated him to kill her (thus setting off the events in ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2''). However, when he discovered how much fame Sidney had attracted due to those events, Roman snapped and lured Sidney out of hiding.

Roman then tells Sidney of his plan to frame her for the murders, before killing ''Stab'' producer John Milton. Sidney angrily tells Roman that he is responsible for all of the events that have occurred. A fight ensues between Sidney and Roman, ending when Roman shoots Sidney in the chest, seemingly killing her. While preparing for Gale and Dewey to arrive, Sidney disappears, giving her the upper hand to stab Roman in the back. As he slowly dies, Sidney shows him that she too was wearing a bulletproof vest. She then plunges Roman's knife into his chest, apparently killing him. Dewey and Gale arrive before Roman recovers, only for Dewey to shoot him in the head while being encouraged by Sidney, finally killing him and ending his killing spree.

Sometime after at Sidney's house, Dewey proposes to Gale, who accepts. Sidney returns from a walk with her dog and leaves her gates, which were previously shown to be alarmed, open. She enters her home and is invited to join Dewey, Gale, and Detective Kincaid to watch a movie. As she goes to join the others, her front door blows open behind her, but after hesitating for a moment she walks away leaving it as is, finally confident that the murders have ended and she is now safe.

[[Neve Campbell]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[David Arquette]], and [[Liev Schreiber]] all returned to their roles as [[Sidney Prescott]] and [[news reporter]] [[List of Scream characters#Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers]], [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], and [[List of Scream characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]], now host of a TV show, respectively for ''Scream 3'', their characters being the only central roles to survive the events of the previous two films. In an interview, Craven stated that convincing the central cast to return to film a new ''Scream'' film was not difficult but as with ''Scream 2'', their burgeoning fame and busy schedules made arranging their availability with the film's production period difficult.<ref name="fangoria189" /> The consequence of Campbell's commitments in particular meant she was only available to film her role for 20 days forcing the script to reduce the series' main character to a smaller role while focusing on the other characters played by Cox and Arquette.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary" /> Lynn McCree finally makes a physical appearance in the series as Maureen Prescott (though only through a hallucination of Sidney), and Sidney now is a [[crisis intervention|crisis counselor]]. [[Roger L. Jackson]] again returned to voice the antagonist [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] and [[Jamie Kennedy]] reprised his role as [[List of Scream characters#Randy Meeks|Randy Meeks]] in spite of the character's death in ''Scream 2''. Negative feedback following the death of Randy had the production consider methods to have had his character survive to appear in ''Scream 3'' including having the character's family hide him away for safety while recuperating from his injuries, but it was deemed too unbelievable and the idea was replaced with the character appearing in a minor role via a pre-recorded video message.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary" />

Many of the supporting cast played fictitious actors taking part in the [[film within a film]] "Stab 3" including [[Emily Mortimer]] as [[List of Scream characters#Angelina Tyler|Angelina Tyler]], [[Parker Posey]] as [[List of Scream characters#Jennifer Jolie|Jennifer Jolie]], [[Matt Keeslar]] as [[List of Scream characters#Tom Prinze|Tom Prinze]], [[Jenny McCarthy]] as [[List of Scream characters#Sarah Darling|Sarah Darling]], and [[Deon Richmond]] as [[List of Scream characters#Tyson Fox|Tyson Fox]] with [[Scott Foley]] as the film's director, [[List of Scream characters#Roman Bridger|Roman Bridger]]. Additional cast included [[Lance Henriksen]] as [[film producer]] [[List of Scream characters#John Milton|John Milton]], [[Patrick Dempsey]] as detective [[List of Scream characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]], [[Patrick Warburton]] as bodyguard [[List of Scream characters#Steven Stone|Steven Stone]], and [[Kelly Rutherford]] as [[List of Scream characters#Christine|Christine Hamilton]], girlfriend to Cotton Weary. Rutherford was cast after filming had begun as the production was undergoing constant rewrites and the opening scene evolved from requiring only a female corpse to needing a live actress with whom Schreiber could interact.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Shortly after being cast, Mortimer was found to lack the necessary work permit to allow her involvement in the film, requiring her to be flown to [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] to obtain one.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> ''Scream 3'' also featured the first live on-screen appearance of Sidney Prescott's mother [[List of Scream characters#Maureen Prescott|Maureen Prescott]], played by Lynn McRee, the actress previously having represented the character in photographs during the previous films.

Lawrence Hecht and C.W. Morgan appeared in minor roles reprising their characters of Sidney's father [[List of Scream characters#Neil Prescott|Neil Prescott]] and Hank Loomis respectively. [[Nancy O'Dell]] appeared as an unnamed reporter, having previously appeared in ''Scream 2'' and would go on to appear in ''[[Scream 4]]'' in the same role. ''Scream 3'' featured several cameo appearances including the fictional characters of [[Jay and Silent Bob]] from the 1994 film ''[[Clerks]]'' played by [[Jason Mewes]] and [[Kevin Smith]], and director [[Roger Corman]] as an on-set studio executive. [[Carrie Fisher]] made a cameo in the film as former actress Bianca Burnette at the suggestion of [[Bob Weinstein]]; Fisher helped to write her character.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/>

In a 2009 interview, [[Matthew Lillard]], who played [[List of Scream characters#Stu Macher|Stu Macher]] in ''Scream'', said that he had been contracted to reprise his role in ''Scream 3'' as the primary antagonist, having survived his apparent death, orchestrating new Ghostface attacks from prison on high school students and ultimately targeting Sidney.<ref name="stuscream3"/><ref name="stuscream3B"/> Following the [[Columbine High School massacre]] shortly before production began, the script was scrapped and re-written without his character and this plot to avoid development of a film which associated violence and murder with a high school setting.<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/>

''Scream 3'' was released just over two years after ''Scream 2'', [[greenlit]] with a budget of $40 million, a significant increase over the budgets of ''Scream'' at $15 million<ref name="screambudget"/> and ''Scream 2'' at $24 million.<ref name="scream2budget"/> Williamson's involvement had been contracted while selling his ''Scream'' script, to which he had attached two five-page outlines for potential sequels, what would become ''Scream 2'' and ''Scream 3'', hoping to entice buyers with the prospect of purchasing a franchise rather than a single script. Craven too had been contracted for two potential sequels following a successful [[test screening]] of ''Scream'' and he returned to direct the third installment.<ref name="fangoria160"/> Shortly before production began on the film, two teenagers staged a deadly attack on their school, killing several students in what became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. In the aftermath of the incident, many parties began looking for reasoning behind their actions and there came an increased scrutiny on the role of the media in society, including [[video game]]s and film, and the influence it could have on an audience. With production of ''Scream 3'' not yet underway, there were considerations about whether the film should be made at that time, aware of the potential for negative attention but the studio decided to press forward, albeit with changes.<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/> The studio remained however much more apprehensive concerning violence and gore in ''Scream 3'' than with previous installments, pressing for a greater emphasis on the series' satiric humor while scaling back on the violence. At one point in the production, the studio went as far as demanding that the film feature no blood or on-screen violence at all, a drastic departure for the series, but Craven directly intervened stating that the film should either have the violence present in earlier ''Scream'' films or should be called something other than ''Scream''.<ref name="fangoria190"/>

===Writing===
[[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] approached Williamson in early 1999 to pursue a full script for a third installment to the ''Scream'' franchise, ''Scream 3''. However, following his successes with the ''Scream'' series and other projects such as ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', Williamson had become involved in multiple projects including the development of the short-lived TV series ''[[Wasteland (TV series)|Wasteland]]'' and directing his self-penned film ''[[Teaching Mrs. Tingle]]'' (1999) which Williamson had written prior to ''Scream'' and which had languished in [[development hell]] since.'<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/> Unable to develop a full script for the production, Williamson instead wrote a 20–30 page draft outline for the film that involved the return of [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] to the fictional town of Woodsboro where the "Stab" series, a fictional series of [[film within a film|films within a film]] that exist within the ''Scream'' universe and are based on the events of ''Scream'', would be filmed.<ref name="fangoria190"/> The Weinsteins hired ''[[Arlington Road]]'' scribe [[Ehren Kruger]] to replace Williamson and helm writing duties, developing a script based on Williamson's notes.

| style="text-align: left;" | "When you're doing a rewrite script, it's never totally coming from you. It's never the same as writing an original. So often, what you look for is, 'Well who am I going to be working with?' and 'Who am I going to be learning from?' The [answers to those] questions give you a lot of motivation for pursuing a project like this."

The environment for ''Scream 3''{{'}}s development had become more complicated than with previous films. There was an increased scrutiny on the effects of violence in media and the effect it could have on the public in the aftermath of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] which occurred shortly before production would begin on the film. In addition, since the release of the original ''Scream'' films, various acts of violence had taken place which had gained notoriety and media attention when they were linked to, or blamed on, the films.<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/><ref name="controversyCBS"/><ref name="controversyIndependent"/> Eager to avoid further criticism or connection to such incidents, Williamson's notes were largely discarded as the studio insisted that the script should focus on the comedic elements of the series while significantly reducing the violence.<ref name="fangoria190"/> The setting of the film was changed from Woodsboro to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] upon which Kruger commented that he believed the characters should be moving to "bigger" places from [[high school]], to [[college]] to the city of Hollywood.<ref name="fangoria190"/> Behind the scenes however, the move away from Woodsboro was mandated as it was considered that a film containing violent acts of murder in and around the small town of Woodsboro and the associated school would attract significant negative criticism and attention that could be detrimental to the production and studio, the film set for release less than a year following the Columbine incident.<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/>

Kruger agreed to develop the script for ''Scream 3'' primarily to work with Craven and the executives under [[Miramax]], arguing that writing a sequel to the work of someone else was not the same as writing "an original".<ref name="fangoria190"/> To help in developing the script, Kruger read copies of Williamson's scripts for ''Scream'' and ''Scream 2'' as well as watching the earlier films to better understand the characters and tone.<ref name="fangoria190"/> In an interview, Kruger admitted that his lack of involvement with the development of the principal cast of ''Scream'' hampered his ability to portray them true to their previous characterization. Early scripts had the character of Sidney Prescott much like "[[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Linda Hamilton]] in ''[[Terminator 2]]''" - a more action-orientated heroine - at which point Craven would intervene and correct the script to bring the characters closer to their previous appearances.<ref name="fangoria190"/> Kruger would admit that despite not receiving any writing credit, Craven had a significant hand in developing the script for ''Scream 3''.<ref name="fangoria190"/> Like ''Scream 2'', the script for ''Scream 3'' was subject to repeated alterations with pages sometimes completed only on the day on which they were to be filmed.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Multiple scenes were rewritten to include previously absent characters or change elements of the plot when it was decided that they were not connecting with other scenes.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> In a 2013 interview, Williamson further detailed his original script which would have seen the killers be a "Stab" fan club of Woodsboro kids. All the members of the club would have been involved in the killings and the final twist "of the movie was when Sidney walked into the house after Ghostface had killed everyone ... and they all rose up. None of them were actually dead and they'd planned the whole thing." Williamson later adapted this story for his 2013 TV series ''[[The Following]]''.<ref name="Writing2013"/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Scream 3'' began on July 6, 1999 in and around [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]] on a budget of $40 million and finished on September 29, 1999 after twelve weeks.<ref name="ETrueHollywoodStory"/> Filming took place largely in the areas of [[San Fernando Valley]], [[Macarthur Park]], [[Beverly Hills]], [[Hollywood Hills]] and [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silverlake]]<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/> with the isolated home of Campbell's character situated in [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]].<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/> The opening scene involves [[List of Scream characters#Cotton Weary|Cotton Weary]] (Schreiber) driving before arriving home where he is murdered by the [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] character. For the driving scene, the production filmed on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/> but the following scene in Cotton's apartment was changed frequently, requiring alterations to the driving scene to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], modifying who speaks to Cotton by phone and what the conversation entailed. Unable to return to Hollywood Boulevard, the scene was reshot on a street outside of the production studio in San Fernando Valley and intermixed with footage taken on the Boulevard.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> The opening attack scene was filmed partially at the exterior and interior of Harper House in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/> but changes were made to the scene including introducing a live girlfriend for Cotton instead of her being dead when Cotton arrives.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> It was later decided that the confrontation between Cotton and Ghostface, featuring Cotton physically dominating the character and attempting to escape by [[Daylighting#Skylights|skylight]], was unrealistic and made Ghostface appear weak and this scene was reshot.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Again however, they were unable to return to Harper House to conduct filming and resorted to constructing a replica of the apartment interior to produce the necessary footage which had the Ghostface character appear more dominant and completely excised the attempted skylight escape.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Cox's character is introduced during a seminar which takes place within a [[classroom]] at [[UCLA]], a location previously used in ''Scream 2'' to represent the fictional Windsor College.<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/><ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/> The [[film studio]] where the fictional "Stab 3" is filmed is represented by the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], San Fernando Valley while scenes at the home of Posey's character were filmed in the [[Hollywood Hills]] at Runyon Ranch in [[Runyon Canyon Park]].<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/> The finale, featuring the final attacks of the film and confrontation between the antagonist and Sidney, was filmed at the [[Canfield-Moreno Estate]], a mansion in Silverlake.<ref name="scream3filmlocations"/>

A scene in the film involved Campbell being pursued by Ghostface through [[Set construction|filmset]] replicas of locations from the original ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' including her character's home. The scene was not present in the script itself but Craven paid to have the sets constructed, knowing he wanted to revisit the original film in some manner. After the construction of the sets, the scene was then written around the resulting areas producing the scene in the final film.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> The script underwent changes repeatedly as filming was conducted with pages regularly only available on the day of filming.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Additionally, if the production decided to change a scene this sometimes meant refilming other scenes to maintain continuity requiring further rewrites. The production team purposely filmed large amounts of footage containing different variations of each scene based on the different script developments in order that, should the script further change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date, requiring them to obtain access to locations or build sets. The opening scene in particular had several alternate versions filmed, initially altering the girlfriend of Schreiber's character from dead to alive, resulting in the prior driving scene being changed to alter dialog and tone to make sense with the changes. Additionally, a three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had over two-hours of footage filmed.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> The script for the film was so in flux that the epilogue scene was filmed with three variants of Patrick Dempsey's character - one with him absent, one where his arm is [[bandage]]d and one with him in a normal condition - as the production were not certain what his ultimate fate would be following the finalization of the film.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/>

===Post-production===
In January 2000, three months after completing principal photography for ''Scream 3'', the ending was refilmed when it was decided to be an inadequate conclusion.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> Originally the ending consisted of Sidney (Campbell) easily defeating Roman (Scott Foley) which led into an early morning scene of police arriving and then into the final scene of Sidney in her home.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/> The production considered that this amounted to essentially three endings, damaging the pacing of the film and there was also consideration that, being the concluding chapter of the trilogy, the audience needed to believe that Sidney could lose and die, something her easy victory did not achieve.<ref name="scream2dvdcommentary"/><ref name="behindthescreamdocu"/> To create the alternate ending, the fight scene between Sidney and Roman was extended and an addition involved Roman shooting Sidney, seemingly to death where previously she had simply hidden from the character. A major addition was the presence of the character [[List of Scream characters#Mark Kincaid|Mark Kincaid]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), who had previously been completely absent from the finale, after the production realized that his character simply disappeared from the plot and his story arc went nowhere.<ref name="scream3dvdcommentary"/>

As with production of ''Scream'', Craven encountered repeated conflicts over censorship with the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA]] regarding violence, and the director stated in an interview that the issues made him consider leaving the horror genre.<ref name="fangoria189"/>

===Music===
[[Marco Beltrami]] returned to score ''Scream 3'', having scored the previous two films in the series. For the film, Beltrami employed seven [[orchestrator]]s to aid in scoring the extensive orchestral accompaniment featured in the film's score. He experimented with new styles of sound production by recording instruments in abnormal circumstances such as inserting objects into a piano and recording at various velocities to create a distorted, unnatural sound and modifying the results electronically.<ref name="scream3score1"/><ref name="scream3scoreplusLament">{{cite web |last=Jarry|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/albums/database/?id=2329|title=Scream 3|date=1998-08-09|accessdate= March 3, 2005}}</ref> Beltrami continued to incorporate a heavy vocal orchestra throughout the score as he had with the previous films.<ref name="scream3score1">{{cite web |first=Christian|last=Clemmensen|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/scream3.html|title=Scream 3 |date=29 February 2000 |accessdate= March 19, 2011}}</ref> There was consideration that Beltrami was forced to hire multiple orchestrators to complete the score to meet the films deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/index5.php?option=com_content&view=article&id='%20.%20(2941)%20.%20'scream|title=Scream 3 - Score|accessdate= March 19, 2011}}</ref> Beltrami took inspiration from other composers for the score, again incorporating excerpts of the score to ''[[Broken Arrow (1996 film)|Broken Arrow]]'' by Hans Zimmer in the track "Sid Wears a Dress".<ref name="scream3score1" />

==Reception==
''Scream 3'' held its [[premiere]] on February 3, 2000 at the [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Avco theater in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]]<ref name="scream3premiere"/> with a public release following on February 4, 2000.

===Critical reaction===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 111 reviews and an average rating 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Scream 3'' has become what it originally spoofed. Despite some surprising twists, the movie seems to have lost its freshness and originality by falling back on the old horror formulas and cliches."<ref name="scream3critrecep"/> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/scream-3 | title=Scream 3 | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc}}</ref> On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref>

''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' was particularly critical of the film, calling the film's [[metafiction]] commentary a poor imitation of Craven's own horror film ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare]]'' (1994).<ref name="Scream3TimeOut"/>  Of the characters, Roger Ebert said "[the characters] are so thin, they're transparent" but praised Campbell's appearance saying, "The camera loves her. She could become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute."<ref name="Scream3RogerEbert"/>

In a positive review, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film, "Genuinely scary and also highly amusing",<ref name="scream3critcream"/> and the [[BBC]] stated that "as the conclusion to the trilogy it works more effectively than anyone had a right to expect".<ref name="Scream3BBC"/> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also praised the film as the end of the ''Scream'' trilogy, saying "Aficionados will be the best able to appreciate how wittily Craven has brought down the curtain on his much-imitated, genre-reviving series"<ref name="Scream3Variety"/> while ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' called it "satisfying" though believed the premise of the series had worn thin.<ref name="Scream3Empire"/>
