'''''Necropolis Awakened''''' is a 2002 American [[action film|action]]-[[horror film]] written and directed by [[Garrett White]].  It stars Duke White, Brandon White, and Garrett White in multiple roles.  An evil corporation bent on world domination begins their genetic experimentation in a small Oregon town, but they find unexpected resistance from an alcoholic veteran.

== Plot ==
Skyhook, a small Oregon town, is chosen to be the new headquarters of Neo-Genentrix.  Nefarious Thorne, the genocidal CEO, unleashes a genetic experiment that converts most of the inhabitants of Skyhook into zombies.  Unsatisfied with anything less than complete domination, Thorne brings in assassins to hunt down the last remaining human, Bob, an alcoholic war hero and survivalist who was initially responsible for inviting Neo-Genentrix in Skyhook.  When Bob evades the mercenaries, Thorne himself tracks him down and captures him.  However, Bob is able to turn the tables on his captors and stop their plans for world domination.

== Cast ==
* Duke White as Bob and Judas
* Brandon White as Johnny Gog, Nefarious Thorne, and Graven
* Garrett White as Tiden
* Brandon Dubisar as Detroit
* Coren Slogowski as Billie Sigmund

== Production ==
''Necropolis Awakened'' was shot in [[Madras, Oregon]] over a period of 90 days, starting in May 2002.  Duke, the father of Brandon and Garrett, initially rejected the idea of a [[zombie film]], as he felt the concept was played out.  Garrett was able to convince Duke that an action-horror hybrid film could be original.  Local residents volunteered as extras, and the sheriff's department allowed shooting at a newly built jail.  The Whites later worked more closely with the sheriff's department after someone mistakenly alerted the FBI about possible terrorist activity.<ref name=trib>{{cite news|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=132053|title=Zero tolerance for Zombies|last=Matheny|first=Susan|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|date=2002-11-26|accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>
