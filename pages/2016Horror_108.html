==Plot==
Sixteen<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO 19. Sixteen is correct. She has to lie about her age to get jobs. One of the agents helps her get a fake ID -->-year-old aspiring model Jesse has just moved from small-town [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to [[Los Angeles]]. She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Sarah and Gigi. The three women are intrigued by Jesse's natural beauty and curious about her sexual proclivities. Jesse feigns experience in the latter.

Jesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modelling agency, who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. Jesse goes on a date with Dean, but keeps his advances at bay. She returns to her motel room to find it ransacked and occupied by a mountain lion. Jesse goes to the photo shoot with Jack, who covers her naked body in gold paint. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah begin envying Jesse's youth, while Ruby is fascinated with her.

Jesse goes to a [[casting call]] for fashion designer Robert Sarno, where Sarah is also present. He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. A distraught Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, "It's everything." Sarah lunges toward her, and Jesse accidentally cuts her hand on glass. Sarah immediately sucks the blood from Jesse's hand. Jesse rushes back to her motel and faints, hallucinating strange images. Dean arrives and treats Jesse's wound.

At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about all the [[cosmetic surgery]] she has had done, and expresses disbelief that Jesse has not used [[casting couch]]es to achieve success. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she saw before in her hallucination. After the show, a visibly-changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno denigrates women who have cosmetic surgery, using a humiliated Gigi as an example. In contrast, he praises Jesse's natural looks. Dean challenges this view and tries to convince Jesse to leave, but she rejects him, now displaying a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] new persona.

Jesse has a nightmare of being forced to sexually swallow a knife. She wakes up in time to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She quickly turns the lock, but is left to listen as the intruder breaks into the next room and assaults the female occupant. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who tells her to come over. Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a diagram on Jesse's mirror and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue, where she [[necrophilia|pleasures herself with a female corpse]].

Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Jesse is attacked by Gigi and Sarah. Ruby pushes Jesse into a huge empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. The three women approach her with knives. Ruby is then seen in a bath full of Jesse's blood; Sarah and Gigi are shown washing blood off in the shower. Later, Ruby is revealed to have occult tattoos. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave as part of a ritual that culminates in her living room, where a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals.

The next day, Sarah drives Gigi to one of Jack's photoshoots with another model named Annie. Jack wanders to the living room and is suddenly enthralled with Sarah and fires Annie on the spot. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi vomit up one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, "I need to get her out of me", and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die, eats the regurgitated eyeball, and returns to the photoshoot.

On November 3, 2014, Refn's production company [[Space Rocket Nation]] alongside its co-financiers [[Gaumont Film Company]] and [[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] announced that Refn's next film would be titled ''The Neon Demon'', to be filmed in Los Angeles in early 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordiskfilmogtvfond.com/index.php/news/stories/nicolas-winding-refn-readies-danishfrench-horror-tale/|title=Nordisk Film & TV Fond :: Nicolas Winding Refn Readies Danish/French Horror Tale|publisher=|accessdate=January 20, 2015}}</ref>

She’s like, ‘I’m done with Asia. I will only do Los Angeles.’ And so I came up with an idea and went to L.A., and I cast this woman called Elle Fanning who is absolutely fantastic, and she played the lead."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/nicolas-winding-refn-neon-demon-elle-fanning/|work=Screen Rant|title=Nicolas Winding Refn on The Neon Demon's Female-Dominated Cast|author=Shaw-Williams, H.|date=September 7, 2015|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}</ref>

==Critical response==
''The Neon Demon'' received a mixed response from critics. Much like Refn's previous film, ''[[Only God Forgives]]'', the film received both boos and a standing ovation during its premiere at Cannes Film Festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-neon-demon-first-reactions-nicolas-winding-refn-cannes-20160519|title='The Neon Demon' First Reactions: Walkouts, Yelling at the Screen and a Five-Star Review in Cannes|last=Nordine|first=Michael|website=Indiewire|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3391788/neon-demon-booed-cannes/|title='The Neon Demon' Was Booed at Cannes|website=[[Bloody-Disgusting.com]]|first=Jonathan|last=Barkan|date=May 19, 2016|accessdate=May 19, 2016}}</ref> It holds a 58% approval rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 226 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's consensus reads, "''The Neon Demon'' is seductively stylish, but Nicolas Winding Refn's assured eye can't quite compensate for an underdeveloped plot and thinly written characters."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_neon_demon/|title=The Neon Demon (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-neon-demon |title=The Neon Demon reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>

[[Robbie Collin]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film five out of five stars, stating, "When the film reaches its logical end point, Refn just keeps pushing, and eventually lands on a sequence so jaw-dropping – almost certainly a sly, glossy-magazine refashioning of [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí|Salvador Dali]]'s groundbreaking surrealist short ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' – that all you can do is howl or cheer."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/05/19/the-neon-demon-is-a-depraved-deliciously-divisive-nightmare---re/|title=The Neon Demon's jaw-dropping depravity leaves Cannes reeling – review|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref> Tirdad Derakhshani, writing for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', called Refn a "bold visionary artist... able to revel in the culture of instant gratification while also subjecting it to critique", giving the film three and a half out of four stars and calling it a "brutal masterpiece".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/20160624__Neon_Demon___Elle_Fanning_mesmerizes_in_brutal_masterpiece.html|title='Neon Demon': Elle Fanning mesmerizes in brutal masterpiece|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref> Rene Rodriguez of ''[[Miami Herald|The Miami Herald]]'' wrote positively of the film's visuals and experimental filmmaking, writing, "To complain that ''The Neon Demon'' lacks substance or that it doesn't have anything to say about our cultural obsession with beauty is to miss the crazy, cracked pageant unfolding in front of you. Not all movies are intended to be read like books; some are meant to be experienced," going on to call it a "film that is guaranteed to elicit strong reactions." He awarded the film three out of four stars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/we-need-talk-about-039the-neon-demon039-r-article|title=We need to talk about 'The Neon Demon' (R)|website=Miami.com|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref>

Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review: "A horror film is what ''The Neon Demon'' is (sort of). It’s set in the Los Angeles fashion world, and it’s the kind of movie in which models look like mannequins that look like slasher-film corpses, and corpses look like love objects. Beauty mingles with mangled flesh, and each fastidiously slick image seems to have come out of ''[[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]'' or ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' or a very sick version of a [[Calvin Klein]] commercial. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue, every pause is so hypnotically composed, so luxuriously overdeliberate, that the audience can't help but assume that Refn knows exactly what he's doing – that he's setting us up for the kill. He is, but not if you're on the lookout for a movie that makes sense. (Oh, ''that''.)"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/cannes-the-neon-demon-nicolas-winding-refn-elle-fanning-1201778544/|title=Cannes Film Review: ‘The Neon Demon’|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|date=May 19, 2016|accessdate=May 21, 2016}}</ref> Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review and called it "[a] stultifyingly vapid, ponderously paced allegorical critique of the modeling world whose seethingly jealous inhabitants can't wait to literally chew each other up and spit each other out". [[Glenn Kenny]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film as "ridiculous and puerile," and opined, "Mr. Refn composes striking images, but they're all secondhand: faux [[Federico Fellini|Fellini]], faux [[David Lynch]] and so on."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kenny|first1=Glenn|title=Review: In ‘The Neon Demon,’ Beauty Masks a Rotting Core|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/movies/the-neon-demon-review-elle-fanning.html?platform=hootsuite|website=The New York Times|accessdate=June 25, 2016|date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>

The French film magazine ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' named ''The Neon Demon'' the third-best film of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|work=Cahiers du cinema|url= https://www.cahiersducinema.com/produit/decembre-2016-n728 |title=  Top Ten 2016, Décembre 2016 n°728 }}</ref>
