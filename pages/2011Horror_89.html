==Plot==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
Though no one can see him, Hollow Face lurks in the corners, desperately desiring love but only knowing how to spread fear and hate.

In England, Hollow Face creeps into the life of John Farrow, after Farrow's beloved 12-year-old (birthday party is seen) daughter Mia is assaulted in their home.  In Spain, Hollow Face creeps into the life of Luisa and her adolescent son Juan, after Juan is assaulted in their home.  The line between the real and the imaginary blurs as fissures start to open within the family unit. It seems that no security measure can keep Hollow Face out.
