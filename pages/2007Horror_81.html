==Plot==
Troubled by the death of his father ([[Matt Craven]]) in an auto accident, Kale Brecht ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) attacks his [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher ([[Rene Rivera (actor)|Rene Rivera]]) when the teacher invokes his father while reprimanding him. For the assault, he is sentenced by a sympathetic judge to three months under [[house arrest]] with an [[ankle monitor]] and a [[proximity sensor]]. Detective Parker ([[Viola Davis]]) explains the system to Kale and his mother Julie ([[Carrie-Ann Moss]]). Initially, the teen just plays video games, but he is soon grounded by Julie and loses his access to the [[iTunes Music Store]], [[Xbox Live]], and his television.

Kale's boredom leads him to watch the neighborhood, including the two neighbor boys who play pranks on him, his next-door neighbor Robert Turner ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]), and Ashley Carlson ([[Sarah Roemer]]), the new girl in town. One night, Kale becomes suspicious of Robert Turner, who returns home in a 1967 [[Ford Mustang]] with a dented fender that matches the description given on a news report of a serial killer at large. Kale's best friend Ronnie ([[Aaron Yoo]]) visits to spy on Ashley and, when they accidentally alert her to their hijinks, the curious girl joins them in spying on Turner. Kale observes a young woman Turner had picked up from a nightclub as she flees the house in a panic but later appears to leave in her car.

Ashley throws a party and teases Kale, knowing he is watching. He plays non-party music loudly to needle her, and Ashley comes over to stop it. But the two flirt and start to make out, distracting each other while blood splatters on Turner's windows. Later, as Kale and Ashley watch, Turner drags a heavy bag to his garage. Kale gets Ashley to follow Turner, but he confronts her in her car with a calm, but threatening manner. Meanwhile, Ronnie successfully breaks into Turner's garage with a camera but gets trapped when the garage door closes. Kale leaves to rescue him but alerts the police upon leaving his property with the ankle monitor. The police come and search the garage but show Kale the bag contains a roadkill deer. Julie then goes across the street to talk to Turner to ask him not to press charges, while Ronnie reveals that he has escaped from Turner's house.

When Kale watches the tape Ronnie made in Turner's house, he notices a dead body in plastic in a vent. Next door, Turner takes Julie captive and enters Kale's house, knocking out Ronnie and binding and gagging Kale. The killer reveals his plan to frame Kale for the murders of Ronnie and Julie and make it appear Kale then committed suicide. When Ashley arrives, interrupting the plan, the two teens barricade themselves in a room, where Ashley unties Kale, and they flee out a window. Kale's ankle monitor again alerts the police, and he enters Turner's home to search for his mother. In a hidden room, Kale finds ample evidence of Turner's previous murders. The officer who monitors Kale arrives at the scene but is killed by Turner. Kale stumbles upon the decaying remains of murder victims and finds his mother bound and gagged. Turner appears and, in the ensuing confrontation, Kale fatally stabs him with a pair of gardening shears.

In the aftermath, Kale is shown having his ankle bracelet removed by the authorities for good behavior, getting back at the two boys from earlier pranks and making out with Ashley on his sofa, while Ronnie is playfully video taping them.

==Production==

===Development===
The script was written in the 1990s and was optioned. The original studio let the option expire after hearing about [[Christopher Reeve]]'s remake of ''Rear Window''. It was not until 2004 that the script was rewritten and sold.

Executive Producer [[Steven Spielberg]] arranged for LaBeouf to be on the casting shortlist for this film because he was impressed by LaBeouf's work on ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]''. Caruso auditioned over a hundred males for the role in five weeks before settling on LaBeouf as he was looking for someone "who guys would really like and respond to, because he wasn't going to be such a pretty boy". LaBeouf was attracted to the role because of the director's 2002 film ''[[The Salton Sea (2002 film)|The Salton Sea]]'', which he complimented as one of his favorite films. Before filming started, the two watched the thriller films ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', and ''[[The Conversation]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. They also viewed the 1989 [[romantic film]] ''[[Say Anything...]]'' and "mixed all the movies together."<ref name="Biggie">{{cite web|title=Interview with Shia LaBeouf– Disturbia|url=http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|work=Biggie|accessdate=November 22, 2013|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223415/http://www.biggie.co.nz/article/shia_la_beouf|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> LaBeouf says he spoke to people on house arrest and locked himself in a room with the bracelet to feel what the confinement of house arrest is like.<ref name="Biggie" /> He commented in an interview, "...it's hard. I'm not going to say it's harder than jail, but it's tough. House arrest is hard because everything is available. [...] The temptation sucks. That's the torture of it."<ref name="Biggie" /> Caruso gave him the freedom to [[improvise]] whenever necessary to make the dialogue appeal to the current generation.

===Filming===
Filmed on location in the cities of [[Whittier, California]] and [[Pasadena, California]]. Filming took place from January 6, 2006 to April 29, 2006. The homes of Kale and Mr. Turner, which were supposed to be across from each other, were actually located in two different cities.<ref name="locations">{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Disturbia.shtml|title=Disturbia Filming Locations|accessdate=June 18, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603195501/http://www.seeing-stars.com/Locations/Disturbia.shtml|archivedate=June 3, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

During filming, LaBeouf began a program that saw him gain twenty five pounds of muscle in preparation of his future films ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hart|first=Hugh|title=Shia LaBeouf's Transformation|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Shia-LaBeouf-s-Transformation-2554059.php|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=[[SFGate]]|date=July 1, 2007}}</ref>

According to LaBeouf, David Morse who plays Mr. Turner, did not speak to LaBeouf or any of the other teens while on set. LaBeouf said, "When we finished filming, he was very friendly. But he's a method actor, and as long as we were shooting, he wouldn't say a word to us."

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 69% based on 172 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Aside from its clichéd resolution, ''Disturbia'' is a tense, subtle thriller with a noteworthy performance from Shia LaBeouf."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disturbia/|title=Disturbia|accessdate=September 27, 2007|publisher=[[Flixster]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on 28 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/disturbia|title=Disturbia (2007): Reviews|accessdate=September 27, 2007|publisher=[[CBS]]|work=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.

Some criticized the change of atmosphere two-thirds of the way into the film, when the initial pacing and action morphs into that of a "run-of-the-mill [[slasher film|slasher]] [[horror film]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/2007/disturbia.shtml |title=Combustible Celluloid film review — Disturbia (2007) |accessdate=September 27, 2007 |author=Jeffrey M. Anderson |date=April 13, 2007 |publisher=Combustible Celluloid}}</ref>

[[David Denby (film critic)|David Denby]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' judged the film "a travesty", adding: "The dopiness of it, however, may be an indication not so much of cinematic ineptitude as of the changes in a movie culture that was once devoted to adults and is now rather haplessly and redundantly devoted to kids."<ref>{{cite news|last=Denby|first=David|title=Disturbia|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/disturbia_caruso|accessdate=August 15, 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=April 23, 2007}}</ref>

===Lawsuit===
The Sheldon Abend Revocable Trust filed a lawsuit against Steven Spielberg, DreamWorks, its parent company [[Viacom]], and [[Universal Studios]] on September 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN0844655020080909 |title=Paramount ripped off Hitchcock Classic |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |author=Edith Honan |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200809081651DOWJONESDJONLINE000605_FORTUNE5.htm |title=2nd UPDATE: Trust Files Copyright Lawsuit Over ''Disturbia'' |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |author=Chad Bray |date=September 9, 2008 |publisher=CNN Money}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The suit alleged that ''Disturbia'' infringed on the rights to [[Cornell Woolrich]]'s 1942 short story "[[It Had to Be Murder]]" (the basis for the classic [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Rear Window]]''), and that DreamWorks never bothered to obtain motion picture rights to the [[intellectual property]] and evaded compensating the rights holder for the alleged appropriation. (Ownership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story "It Had to Be Murder" and its use as the basis for the movie ''Rear Window'' was previously litigated before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]'', 495 U.S. 207 (1990).)  Contrary to some media reports, the claim was based on the original Woolrich short story, not the movie ''Rear Window''.

This claim was rejected by the U.S. District Court in ''Abend v. Spielberg'', 748 F.Supp.2d 200 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), on the basis that the original Woolrich short story and ''Disturbia'' are only similar at a high level of generality and abstraction. "Their similarities derive entirely from unprotectible elements and the total look and feel of the works is so distinct that no reasonable trier of fact could find the works substantially similar within the meaning of copyright law."<ref>{{cite web|title=Abend v. Spielberg decision|url=http://reporter.blogs.com/files/nysd-12708230345.pdf}}</ref> ''Disturbia ''contained many subplots not in the original short story.<ref>{{cite web|title=The "Rear Window Case" Gets a Semi-Sequel|url=http://www.hernblawg.com/the-rear-window-case-gets-a-semi-sequel/|work=blog|publisher=Hernandez Schaedel & Associates, LLP|accessdate=March 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11388284 | work=BBC News | title=Rear Window copyright claim rejected | date=September 22, 2010}}</ref>

After the dismissal of the copyright claim in federal court, the Abend Trust filed another lawsuit in California state court against Universal Studios and the Hitchcock Estate on October 28, 2010, for a [[breach of contract]] claim based on earlier agreements which allegedly restricted the use of ideas from the original Woolrich short story and the movie ''Rear Window'' whether or not the ideas are copyright protectable, that the defendants had entered into with the Abend Trust after the Supreme Court's ''Stewart v. Abend'' decision.<ref name="Hollywood, Esq. blog">{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|title=Decades-Old Legal Battle Over 'Rear Window' Is Back On|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/thr-esq/exclusive-decades-old-legal-battle-33649|accessdate=March 30, 2012|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 29, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Complaint|url=http://www.duetsblog.com/uploads/file/Breach%20of%20Contract%282%29.pdf}}</ref>
