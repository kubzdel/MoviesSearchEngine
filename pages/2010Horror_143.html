'''''Saw 3D''''' (also known as '''''Saw: The Final Chapter''''') is a 2010 American [[3D film|3D]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Kevin Greutert]], written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]], and starring [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] and [[Cary Elwes]]. It is the seventh (and originally intended final) installment of the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], and the only film in the series to be in 3D.

The film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, [[List of Saw characters#Jill Tuck|Jill Tuck]] reveals to an [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs officer]] that rogue [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Mark Hoffman]] is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.

An eighth installment<!-- Not the same eighth installment as "Jigsaw" (2017 film). --> was planned, but the decrease in the [[Saw VI#Box office|box office performance for ''Saw VI'']] compared to previous installments led to ''Saw 3D'' being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for ''Saw VIII'' being incorporated into ''Saw 3D''. ''[[Saw V]]'' director [[David Hackl]] was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming [[Lionsgate Entertainment|Lionsgate]] announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. [[Principal photography]] took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in [[post-production]].

''Saw 3D'' was originally scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on October 22, 2010, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. ''Saw 3D'' opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, ''[[Jigsaw (2017 film)|Jigsaw]]'', in 2017.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->
Two men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and a [[Billy the Puppet (Saw)|puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. The puppet says they can either kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.

After witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.

Dagen awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and they are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.

Gibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.

After destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, which contained a videotape in which Kramer asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Gordon has Hoffman brought to the [[Saw (2004 film)|bathroom]] from the first film and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. When Gordon appears, he throws the [[hacksaw]] he used to sever his own foot out the door, turns off the lights, and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.

===Development===
[[File:Saw VII filming Metro Hall Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|A scene being constructed at the [[Metro Hall]] of Toronto in April 2010.]]
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported in July 2009 that Lionsgate [[Green-light|greenlit]] ''Saw VII'' and announced [[David Hackl]] would return to direct, his last film being ''[[Saw V]]''. Producers [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]], and writers [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]] also returned.<ref name="variety1"/> Brian Gedge replaced series' [[cinematographer]] David Armstrong.<ref name="kevinblog"/><ref name="davidarmstrong"/>  [[Pre-production]] began on September 14, 2009.<ref name="bd3"/> According to Melton, there were plans to title the film ''Saw: Endgame''.<ref name="bd5"/> Originally two sequels were planned after the sixth,<ref name="bd4"/><ref name="shock1"/> but in December 2009 Melton stated in a [[podcast]] interview with the UK radio station [[Demon FM]] that ''Saw VII'' was the final installment and would address unanswered questions from previous ''Saw'' films, such as the fate of the [[Saw (2004 film)|first film]]'s protagonist [[Lawrence Gordon (character)|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]] and other Jigsaw survivors from previous films, while bringing a final resolution to the series. The storyline for a ''Saw VIII'' was combined into ''Saw VII''; this decision was primarily due to [[Saw VI#Box office|''Saw VI''{{'s}} below average box office performance]].<ref name="SawVIII"/><ref name="QA With Patrick Melton"/>  On July&nbsp;22, 2010 in an interview with ''[[USA Today]]'' the producers confirmed that ''Saw VII'' will officially end the film series.<ref name="usatoday"/> Burg told [[Reuters]] that, "In every ''Saw'' movie, we left questions open and in ''Saw VII'' we answer every question the audience has ever had". He added that, "even new viewers will be able to follow and get caught up to speed".<ref name="reuters"/>

In January 2010, [[Kevin Greutert]], who made his directorial debut with the sixth film, was about to begin work on [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]'s ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'' when [[Twisted Pictures]] suddenly dismissed Hackl and forced Greutert on the project by exercising a "contractual clause" in his contract, much to Greutert's dismay.<ref name="Greutert director"/><ref name="LAtimes"/><ref name="bd6" /><ref name="bd6-2" /> When Greutert arrived on set two weeks before filming began, he performed a "compressive re-write" of the script.  Melton explained that, "He has a lot of ideas, but it's a bit hard and extreme to implement all of these ideas because sets have been built, people have been cast, props have been bought or created, and with the ''Saw'' films they are so specific in set design because of the traps. It becomes very problematic and difficult to change things a whole bunch right in the middle of it".<ref name="Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2"/>

''Saw 3D'' was originally intended to be two separate films. According to Melton and Dunstan, "It was our original intention to make the final ''Saw'' in two parts, but when ''[Saw] VI'' didn't do so well, the studio got nervous and we were only allowed to make one more."<ref name="2Parts">http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404119/previous-saw-entry-supposed-split-two-exclusive/</ref>

If you think this is a problem, discuss on the talk page. -->Casting began in mid-December 2009.<ref name="twitter"/>  On February&nbsp;22, 2010, [[Cary Elwes]] was listed on the Toronto Film & Television's official list of personnel website for ''Saw 3D'' but on March 8 his name along with other cast members were removed from the list.<ref name="TFTO list"/>  The following month, Lionsgate confirmed his reprisal of the role of [[Lawrence Gordon (character)|Lawrence Gordon]], last seen in [[Saw (2004 film)|the first film]].<ref name="synopsis and cast"/> Dunstan and Melton said that Elwes filmed new scenes.<ref name="bd2"/>  The filmmakers wanted to bring Elwes back earlier, but Elwes wanted to wait until the last film.

He said, "It was actually a little more difficult than I expected because it took a lot for me to figure out how to portray this guy and what exactly his motives were going to be throughout. I thought maybe I was overthinking it, and I met with this really great acting coach who helped me walk through and make sense of the, 'Motivation' ".<ref name="artistdirect"/> [[Devon Bostick]] was offered to reprise his role as [[List of Saw characters#Brent|Brent]] from ''Saw VI'', but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts.<ref name="demonFM4"/>

===Filming in 3D===
''Saw 3D'' was shot entirely in [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3D]] using the SI-3D digital camera system; rather than filming on set traditionally and later transferring the footage to 3D. Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed a minute of the original ''Saw'' film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film.<ref name="Collider"/>  The sets and traps were designed to take advantage of 3D.<ref name="IGN Interview about 3D"/> To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot [[Hand-held camera|handheld]]. ''Saw 3D'' was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He said in an interview with ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, "If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance that when you look at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic".<ref name="PopularMechanics"/> Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series.<ref name="budget"/> [[Principal photography]] began on February 8, 2010, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and wrapped on April 12, 2010.<ref name="bd7"/><ref name="Saw VII Wraps"/> Filming took place mostly at Toronto's [[Cinespace Film Studios]].<ref name="Cinespace"/>

[[File:Kevin Greutert and Elizabeth Rowin at Comic Con 2010.jpg|thumb|left|''Saw 3D'' director Kevin Greutert and his wife, actress Elizabeth Rowin, at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2010.]]
When determining the style of 3D shooting they wanted to use, Burg felt that the audience would want several moments where objects move into the audience, comparing this to ''[[My Bloody Valentine 3D]]''. He acknowledged that this method would be used, but expressed an interest in shooting from the victim's perspective, similar to that of [[first-person shooter]] video games being rendered in 3D.<ref name="Collider"/> Dunstan added that "It adds a whole new layer of discipline and criteria to creating these moments. We've had a very flat surface to try to get a reaction out of you. Now, we get to push out a bit and envelop the viewer, still maintaining the patterns that have worked and been successful, but also to raise it up a notch."<ref name="Collider"/>  Commenting on the change to filming in 3D, Bell stated it would not affect his performance or methods of acting, noting that it would be an "interesting experience".<ref name= "Tobin" /> Mandylor called the 3D shoot "more tedious and longer".<ref name="pressUK"/> Flannery described the 3D aspect as being "[not] shot in 3D so that you can, per&nbsp;se, see blood coming directly at you. It's in 3D for the texture and the depth, for the architecture, to get a sense that you're in the scene but there's no 'we want to see blood coming at the lens' it's nothing like that. But I think we made a good movie."<ref name="maple"/> [[Post-production]] services were provided by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|Deluxe]].<ref name="ProNotes">{{cite web|url=http://lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/saw3d/docs/pro_notes.doc|title=Saw 3D Production Notes|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]|format=[[DOC (computing)|.DOC]] file 4.21MB download|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

===Traps===
Filming of the trap scenes, which was done last, began in March.<ref name="Patrick Melton Talks The Collector 2"/> The film's opening trap scene was filmed at [[Metro Hall]] in Toronto, Ontario, just outside [[Roy Thomson Hall]], and included 400 [[Extra (actor)|extras]].<ref name="RoyThomsonHall"/><ref name="extras"/>  In the trap, the circular saw blades were actually real and functional, but safety precautions were taken for the actors.<ref name="PopularMechanics"/> One actor that was in the trap, Jon Cor, told Demon FM that he had scars on his hands from the shackles, and said the other actors, Sebastian Pigott chipped his tooth and Anne Lee Greene lost the feeling in her feet and had to receive medical attention.<ref name="DemonJon"/>

Producer [[Oren Koules]] told horror news website [[ShockTilYouDrop.com]] that there are eleven traps in the film, the most ever in the franchise.<ref name=officialtitle/>  There is one "trap" scene in the film that producers would not allow in previous ''Saw'' films that they described as "too violent", "too disgusting", and "just wrong".<ref name="bd2"/>  Melton later confirmed that was the "Garage Trap", which involved a car and sets off a "chain reaction" with other characters.<ref name="demonFM2"/> Gabby West was part of the trap. She told [[VH1]], "They molded my entire face, and basically my entire upper body after my belly button. They put layers and layers of different materials on you and you have two straws in your nose so you can breathe. It was so scary! They put so much of it on, you can't see and they put it in your ears so you can barely hear anything. That was part of the prep for the film, which was really cool, to have a dummy made of yourself. But scary."<ref name= "Scream Queens"/> Over 25 gallons of [[Theatrical blood|fake blood]] was used in the film, which was two and half times more than ''[[Saw II]]''.<ref name="Blood">{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/10/more-blood-more-traps-more-billy-dolls-in-saw-3d.html |title=Saw franchise ends with a bang, and a bloodletting |last=Phillips |first=Jevon |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=October 29, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61jRWx2Co?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2010/10/more-blood-more-traps-more-billy-dolls-in-saw-3d.html |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

On July 8, 2010, in some press materials for [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the film was referred to as ''Saw 3D: The Traps Come Alive'', which led to the media assuming it was the final name.<ref name="shock2"/> The following day, Burg and Koules said that "The Traps Come Alive" was simply a tagline that had been misinterpreted as part of the title. Koules said that if they included the seventh Roman numeral followed by "3D" (''Saw VII 3D''), it would have been "cumbersome" and not made the impact they wanted. He explained, "It was such a process in 3D, so much hard work was put in. ''Saw VII 3D'' is too much. This is like a new movie.&nbsp;[...]"<ref name=officialtitle/>

In the same interview, the producers addressed ''Saw''{{'s}} presence at Comic-Con 2010 in San Diego. They said that the footage that was going to be used for the convention could not get approved for the audience; Koules explained, "It's going to be different than what we've done before, we're going to be at Comic-Con but we're not in Comic-Con"."<ref name=officialtitle/> The Comic-Con teaser trailer was released via [[IGN]] on July&nbsp;22, 2010.<ref name= "Saw3D Trailer"/> The next day of the convention, the first eight minutes of the film were screened for the press and a few fans.<ref name="8mintues"/>

The trailer shown in the United Kingdom during a break from ''[[The Gadget Show]]'' was banned after a ten-year-old child complained that it was "distressing" and "inappropriately scheduled". [[Clearcast]] had cleared the trailer for 19:00 [[GMT]], but did not actually air until 20:29. In one scene of the trailer, people in a cinema become trapped to the seats by metal restraints with a hand coming through the screen pulling a person in. The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] said it was "likely to cause distress to young children".<ref name="UKTrailer"/> In [[Massachusetts]], a branch of [[Showcase Cinemas]] showed ''Saw 3D'' instead of the animated film ''[[Megamind]]'', which was being watched by a seven-year-old celebrating a birthday.

''Saw 3D'' was distributed theatrically by Lionsgate in the United States and through [[Maple Pictures]] in Canada.<ref name="maple"/> The film was originally scheduled to be released on October 22, 2010, but in July 2010, three months prior to release, the date was pushed back to October 29.<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="releasedate"/> It also had preview screenings on October&nbsp;28, 2010 in 2,000 locations.<ref name="BOMpreview"/> Since the release of ''Saw IV'', each film has been released a day earlier in Australia and New Zealand; ''Saw 3D'' continued the tradition in Australia, though the New Zealand release was not released until March 3, 2011.<ref name="NZRelease"/> The film was initially rated NC-17 (no children 17 and under admitted) by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]&nbsp;(MPAA) and had to be [[Re-edited film|edited and re-submitted]] six times to secure an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R&nbsp;rating]].<ref name="usatoday"/> In Australia, the [[Australian Classification Board]] gave a heavy [[Australian Classification Board#Restricted|R18+]] (restricted to 18 and over) for "high impact violence, blood and gore",<ref name="R18+"/> whereas all previous ''Saw'' films were rated MA15+ (with the exception of the director's cut version of ''Saw V'').<ref name="MA15+"/>

===Censorship in Germany===
In Germany, its showing as a whole was banned from April 2012 until January 2013 because the Amtsgericht Tiergarten has noted that several scenes in the film violate the violence act §131 StGB. Private copies were still legal to own and personal use was not punishable; however any public screening was a highly prohibited and punishable act. There is a censored "Keine Jugendfreigabe/No youth admitted" version, but it has all the violent scenes cut out. Retailing this copy is still legal, since "KJ" rated films cannot be indexed/banned.<ref>http://www.schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=3600</ref> In January 2013, the appellate court Landgericht Berlin revoked the original court order after [[StudioCanal]], who own the distribution rights for Germany, had appealed against it.<ref>http://www.schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=4849</ref><ref>http://www.schnittberichte.com/news.php?ID=5135</ref>

[[File:Betsy Russell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Betsy Russell]] attending the ''Saw 3D'' premiere at the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] on October 27, 2010.]]
As with the previous four ''Saw'' films, ''Saw 3D'' was not screened in advance for critics.<ref name="SA"/> Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 9%, based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 3.1/10, making it the poorest rated film in the series. The site's consensus reads, "Sloppily filmed, poorly acted, and illogically plotted, ''Saw 3D'' leaves viewers trapped in the most lackluster installment of the series."<ref name="RT">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw3d/|title=Saw 3D (2010)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 24 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/saw-3d/critic-reviews|title=Saw 3D: Reviews (2010)|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>

Luke Thompson of [[E! Online]] gave the film a "B". He called the film's gore "over-the-top" and "in your face" while admitting the film had an "unusual amount of self-parody". He said the central storyline of the films was beginning to feel "played out".<ref name="E! Review Oct28"/> Rob Nelson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review. He called the film "relentlessly repugnant" that would please fans, but offer no surprise. He went on to say, "Apart from these limb-pulling setpieces, tech credits appear fairly shoddy, as do any 3D effects that don't include flying viscera. The editing relies on lazy flashbacks, while the dialogue remains as horrific as the killings."<ref name="Variety review Oct28"/>  Kim Newman of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, calling it "a step down from last year's much more pointed ''[[Saw VI]]''". He criticized the repetition of the plot but thought bringing back Jigsaw survivors was a "nice idea". He closed his review with, "There are a scattering of infallibly cringe-making horrors, but on the whole ''Saw 3D'' could do with more depth".<ref name="EmpireReview Oct28"/>

Eric Goldman of [[IGN Entertainment|IGN Movies]] gave the film two out of five stars. He was unhappy with the little screen time Bell and Elwes had been given, saying that the time the film did spend with them didn't have much impact. He said the traps were a step down from ''Saw VI'', but did point out his favorite and highlight of the film as the "garage trap". About the film's 3D effects, Goldman said "The 3D is used as you might expect it to be – which is to say, this is no [[James Cameron]] immersive experience. Instead, blades jut out of the screen, and there is some fun had with blood and guts literally shooting forward at several points".<ref name="IGN Review"/>  Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He said ''Saw 3D'' is "consistent both stylistically and thematically with previous editions", but said most of the film's traps lack the "[[Rube Goldberg]]-style cleverness that marked the series".  Scheck went on to say that it was "unfortunate" the creators killed Bell's character so early in the series and called Mandylor's character (Hoffman) an "exceedingly bland stand-in". He called the visual impact of the 3D "negligible".<ref name="THRreviewOct29"/> 
[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|right|Creators of the ''Saw'' franchise, [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] at the premiere.]]

Roger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave the film one out of five stars saying, "It's all bunk and has been for years. These are all no-win scenarios. Whatever moral lessons were presented in the earliest ''Saw'' films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?' Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise".<ref name="Orlando Sentinel Oct28"/>  Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film the most "straightforward" of the series and the "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, "If you see the film in a theater equipped with [[RealD Cinema|RealD 3D]] and [[Dolby Digital|Dolby sound]], you'll come away with a pretty good idea of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".<ref name="NYTreviewOct29"/> 
[[File:Cary Elwes Saw 3D premiere cropped.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Cary Elwes|Elwes]] reprises his role as [[List of Saw characters#Lawrence Gordon|Dr. Lawrence Gordon]], last seen in the [[Saw (2004 film)|first film]], in newly filmed scenes as opposed to flashbacks or [[Stock footage|archive footage]].]]
Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' gave the film one out of five stars. She criticized the lack of Bell's screentime saying, "What the filmmakers of the last four ''Saw'' movies have somehow overlooked is that Tobin Bell's Jigsaw is the linchpin of these films. It's right there in the title, so you'd think they'd realize what they lost when they killed him off in ''Saw III''. But it's been downhill ever since, and we hit bottom today". She admitted that the performances have become "painfully stilted" and called the script "a jumble of nothing punctuated by barely-trying death traps". She went on to say, "It's also disappointing to watch a once-original franchise morph into a generic slasher series, in which random people are killed in banal ways just to up the body count" and closed her review with, "No matter how much money ''The Final Chapter'' makes over Halloween weekend, it's time to acknowledge that this game is over".<ref name="NYDailyreviewOct29"/>

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called the film the "most gruesome and least coherent of the seven movies". He felt that some of the film's "games" were just randomly forced into the film, saying that kind of "episodic approach" and 3D works for a "far more innovative series like ''[[Jackass 3D]]''".  Morris closed his review by saying "This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [Jigsaw's] legacy to make him the [[Jerry Springer]] of gore".<ref name="BostonReviewOct30"/> Jason Anderson of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' gave the film two out of four stars.  He praised ''Saw 3D''{{'}}s plot for not being as confusing as previous films, for which he described as having to "generally require an encyclopedic knowledge of the series' many plot strands" in order to understand them. He thought Greutert gave the film a "pulpy energy" and described the film's traps and gore as having an "unpretentious sensibility" to films by [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]].<ref name="TorontoStarOct30"/> Alan Jones of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film four out of five stars saying, "though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins – using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and dental equipment – the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale". He implied that the "shock scenarios" were borrowed from sources such as, ''[[A Man Called Horse (1970 film)|A Man Called Horse]]'' and the work of [[Lucio Fulci]]. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying "the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage".<ref name="RadioTimes"/> The film was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for "Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D", but it lost to ''[[The Last Airbender]]''.
