'''''All About Evil''''' is a 2010 American [[gore film|gore]] [[horror film]]<ref name=variety> https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/all-about-evil-1117942710/amp/</ref> written and directed by [[Peaches Christ|Joshua Grannell]].<ref>[http://www.horrorbid.com/blog/blog1.php/2010/05/17/first-look-all-about-evil-teaser-trailer First Look: 'All About Evil' Teaser Trailer]</ref>

==Plot==
Shy librarian Deborah Tennis ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) takes over her father's old decrepit cinema in attempt to protect the family from the shame of bankruptcy. In the process, she discovers her inner filmmaker -- and serial killer -- with the help of her assistant Mr. Twigs ([[Jack Donner]]), the insane twins Veda and Vera (Jade and Nikita Ramsey), and a robber ([[Noah Segan]]).

When his best friend Judy (Ariel Hart) disappears, Steven Thompson ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]) discovers the truth about Deborah's actions and tries to stop her as she attempts to murder the audience during the premiere of her feature-length film, which is about the audience's deaths. Steven manages to rescue Judy and the audience escapes, killing Mr. Twigs and the robber as they try to stop them. Deborah kidnaps Steven's mother and takes her to the roof to kill her where Steven confronts her. When Steven points out how disappointed her father would be, Deborah gets emotional, allowing Steven's mother to break free and stab her in the neck with her own knife. Steven then pushes her off the roof to her death.

Most of the audience survives and escapes and when the twins come out, the police try to arrest them. Instead of surrendering, they turn on each other and stab each other repeatedly, killing each other. The news talks to Steven about Deborah's films and the possibility of her actions becoming a film, which he doubts will happen, commenting that if it were, Deborah would rise from the dead by now. As he leaves, a worker causes Deborah's body to move and she seems to stare right at him, freaking him out slightly.
