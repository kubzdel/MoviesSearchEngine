'''''Susuk''''' is a 2008 Malaysian horror film which was released on 7 August 2008 in [[Malaysia]]. The film is directed by [[Amir Muhammad (director)|Amir Muhammad]] and [[Naeim Ghalili]]. The story concerns about Soraya, who uses the forbidden practice of [[susuk]] to be famous.

==Plot==
Soraya is a young trainee nurse who is starting to feel disaffected by her life. A chance introduction to the world of glamour piques her earlier ambition to be a star. She does not succeed at first, but she is told that the forbidden practice of susuk can help. She has to make a choice whether to stay the way she is, or cross the line. At first, susuk seems to give her confidence in her performance, and even to stand up to her abusive brother-in-law.

Meanwhile, Suzana is a prominent diva with an air of mystery. She has long been a practitioner of the black arts due to her use of the extreme susuk keramat. Every time she violates a taboo, a human life is required - first in the form of accidental deaths of her loved ones, then by outright murder and [[cannibalism]]. She develops inhuman, supernatural abilities. At the same time, she yearns for her more innocent days and hires a young assistant who reminds her of "happier times".

A mysterious and powerful [[dukun]] guides the two women down their paths to corruption. The viewers follow the lives of these two women until their stories converge in the true secret of this dreaded charm.
