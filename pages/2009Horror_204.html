'''''Surviving Evil''''' (also known as '''''Evil Island''''') is a 2009 [[horror film]] directed and written by Terence Daw, and produced by [[David Pupkewitz]], Anton Ernst and [[Malcolm Kohll]]. It stars [[Billy Zane]], [[Christina Cole]], [[Natalie Mendoza]] and [[Louise Barnes]]. The screenplay concerns six documentary filmmakers who attempt to survive their visit to a [[Philippines|Philippine]] island to shoot a survival special when they discover that the [[shape shifting]], bloodthirsty [[Aswang]], a creature of [[Philippine folklore]] inhabits the island.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/32130/see-billy-zanes-aswang-new-surviving-evil-trailer See Billy Zane's Aswang in New Surviving Evil Trailer]</ref>

==Plot==
A team of six documentary [[filmmakers]], Sebastian "Seb" Beazley ([[Billy Zane]]), Phoebe Drake ([[Christina Cole]]), Cecilia "Chill" Reyes ([[Natalie Mendoza]]), Joey "Tito" Valencia ([[Joel Torre]]), Rachel Rice ([[Louise Barnes]]) and Dexter "Dex" Simms (Colin Moss), arrive to spend six days shooting a wilderness survival special, ''Surviving the Wilderness'', on the remote Mayaman Island, one of the seven thousand islands that make up the [[Philippine Archipelago]]. They set up camp, and it’s not long until ominous events begin to happen, eventually sparking their suspicion that the mythical [[Aswang]] creature inhabits the island. 

The second day, Joey and Cecilia travel alone to the village of the Isarog tribe, where people had been savaged and one woman's corpse remains with her stomach gouged open. Determined to stay for the whole trip, Joey forces Cecilia to keep her silence among the group about the lurking danger. That night, Phoebe overhears one of their conversations and together they discuss the Aswang, detailed as a [[shape shifting]], flesh-eating, jungle tree creature of the [[Filipino folklore]], capable of procreating by altering the [[fetus]] of a pregnant woman in an evolutionary process called ''Dungo nan bunti''. The creatures' fears include staying on the ground too long and fire.

The third day, Sebastian is bitten by the Aswang and Phoebe comes across an infant corpse, as Joey and Cecilia follow map directions to a gun tower close to the Aswang’s nest. There, Cecilia finds out Joey is searching for gold to help his family. The gold and the [[treasure map]] were left behind decades ago by Joey’s grandfather who was a prisoner of the Japanese army in the [[Second World War]]. Joey detonates a hole in the tower floor and goes underground to find and obtain some of the gold. Just then, many Aswang creatures attack Cecilia, who stayed above to take cover for Joey. Cecilia falls out of sight, and when Joey returns to the surface, he is killed by the creatures, to Cecilia's horror.

The group discovers Phoebe is pregnant and the Aswang creatures are after her blood to turn her baby into one of theirs. Cecilia escapes on foot from the creatures, with Dexter eventually finding her after she calls for help. This leads to the whole group coming under attack from the creatures, but they are able to injure some of them. The group attempts to leave the island on an [[inflatable boat|inflatable raft]], but the creatures pursue them again and end up killing Dexter. At nightfall, Sebastian and Phoebe go down a ditch in the jungle; however, Sebastian badly injures himself with his machete during the fall. He tells Phoebe to run and tries to fight off the creatures, but they kill him.

By sunrise on the fourth day, Rachel and Cecilia take shelter at the gun tower. Rachel looks for Joey’s satellite phone, and one of the creatures emerges, only for Cecilia to shoot it with Joey’s gun. Rachel uses a rope to go underground, but it snaps from its wooden hinge and she falls, causing her to lose consciousness. Cecilia solely combats the entourage of creatures which fly out of its nest; however, one of them grabs her and brings her there. A handheld explosive she was preparing before she was taken detonates in the nest, killing her, a pregnant woman inside, and the creatures in the explosion. While this goes on, Phoebe escapes the island on the raft. The next day, she winds up on another island where she realizes three pregnant women are soon to give birth to more creatures. Back at the gun tower, the [[sat phone]] rings in Joey’s bag. Underground, Rachel shows signs that she is alive.

==Production==
Production on the film began in March 2008 and concluded in five weeks. It marked the directorial debut of director/writer Terence Daw. The story was set on a small island in the Philippines, though the filmmakers discovered areas in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[South Africa]] to shoot. Supported by [[List of national parks in Africa|national parks]], they were able to film in the 253-hectare [[Kenneth Stainbank Nature Reserve]] in [[Durban|Yellowwood Park, Durban]], which had the lush tropical vegetation the filmmakers needed and was the ideal double for a Philippine island. Another place used was a beach near [[Umkomaas]], shown in the scene where the crew arrive on the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page2655.html |title=PROUDLY SOUTH AFRICAN FILMMAKING SURVIVING EVIL |publisher=TheWritingStudio.co.za |author=Daniel Dercksen |accessdate=2013-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105180422/http://www.writingstudio.co.za/page2655.html |archivedate=5 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
