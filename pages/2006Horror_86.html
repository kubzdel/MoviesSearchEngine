'''''Halloween Night''''' is a 2006 American [[Horror film|horror]]<ref>{{cite web|title=HALLOWEEN NIGHT|url=http://www.theasylum.cc/product.php?id=122|website=theasylum.cc|publisher=theasylum.cc|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> film produced by [[The Asylum]]. Despite sharing a similar title with the 1978 film ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''Halloween Night'' is itself an original film as opposed to a [[Mockbuster|mockbuster film]].{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Plot==
The film follows Chris Vale (Scot Nery), who was admitted to an asylum at the age of 12, after witnessing how his mother was raped and killed by two thugs hired by his father (who subsequently committed suicide), and nearly killed by them with a headshot. Now a 22-year-old grossly disfigured young man, he escapes from the asylum on Halloween after killing two orderlies who mock his wearing of masks that resemble those the thugs were wearing.

His old home is now inhabited by David Bexter (Derek Osedach)'s family; Bexter hosts a Halloween party there with his girlfriend Shannon (Rebekah Kochan), his friends, and his schoolmates. Vale kills a partygoer named Todd (Nicholas Daly Clark) at a gas station, steals his costume and his car, and drives to the party.

At the party Vale is taken for Todd by everyone and starts a killing spree unnoticed. Meanwhile, David fakes a dispute with a friend who kidnaps Vale (who still is taken for Todd) with a gun, and another friend disguised as a police officer, who is forced to hand over the keys of his car. After escaping with the car, the kidnapper is murdered by Vale, who goes back to the party in it. Because someone at the party has called the real police, the angry officer ends the party by telling everyone to go home, leaving only David, the now disappointed Shannon, and some friends.

Vale enters the house again, killing several of the remaining people and tying Shannon because she wears the collar of his mother that David found in the house earlier. He breaks up a hole in the wall that was covered with boards where the corpse of his mother was hidden by his father before committing suicide.

As one girl escapes from the house in panic David begins to search for Shannon, finding her captured in the basement. After freeing her Vale knocks out David from behind but Shannon manages to grab a gun that Vale has lost shooting him twice, presuming the killer for dead.

As the police and ambulance arrives later David seems to have disappeared with the police searching for him. Suddenly a hooded person appears behind a police officer who is talking to Shannon. Shannon grabs the officers gun shooting and killing the hooded person, after removing the hood she is shocked to see that she killed David.

In the final scene Vale is seen hitch-hiking and picked up by a car-driver who presumes him to having a long Halloween party night. The film ends while the car leaves.

==Reception==
Cinema Crazed panned the movie, writing "as a "''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]''" wannabe, it's horrible, but as a slasher film on its own merits it's horrible".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Halloween Night (2006)|url = http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2006/11/26/halloween-night-2006/|website = Cinema Crazed|access-date = 2016-02-07|last = Vasquez Jr.|first = Felix}}</ref> HorrorNews.net criticized some aspects of the film but also wrote "You get what you signed up for and therefore should be satisfied with that fact alone. Production is slick, score is eerie and the acting makes sense."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Film Review: Halloween Night (2006)|url = http://horrornews.net/33945/film-review-halloween-night-2006/|website = Horrornews.net|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-US}}</ref> [[Dread Central]] also heavily criticized the films, stating "''Halloween Night'' is stupid slasher flick that’s sporadically amusing but mostly dull due to pacing issues, the predictable nature of the “seen it a million times before” storyline, and its insistence on taking itself far too seriously even when it’s being outright dumb."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Halloween Night (DVD)|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4439/halloween-night-dvd/|website = Dread Central|access-date = 2016-02-07|language = en-US}}</ref>
