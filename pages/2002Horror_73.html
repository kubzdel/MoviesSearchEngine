==Plot==
===Crypt-Keeper intro===
The Crypt Keeper is in Jamaica wearing his hair in "deadlocks" as he states that one of his favorite things about Jamaica are the "eye-popping honeys" as it shows different bikini-clad women that are nearby. He then talks about how he just finished wrapping up his new movie in Jamaica. He introduces the movie and tells them "Don't worry, the beast is yet to come."

===Story===
Dr. Alice Dodgson ([[Jennifer Grey]]) is fired from a hospital due to her involvement in the death of a patient. With few options, she decides to take a job as a nurse in [[Jamaica]] caring for Wesley Claybourne ([[Daniel Lapaine]]), a young man apparently suffering from [[encephalitis]]. Alice falls in love with Wesley, but she fears that she and Wesley are the targets of a voodoo cult.

She befriends Caro ([[Kristen Wilson]]), a local girl. Caro advises Alice that any recrimination from the Voodoo community will only come as a result of her interference with their practices. Tension mounts as Alice suffers additional unexplained phenomena.

Caro is revealed as the cause of the strange goings-on; she is seeking revenge against Wesley because their father killed Caro's mother and rejected Caro as his daughter, denying her an inheritance. Caro attempts to paralyze Alice and turn her into a zombie, but Alice is only partially paralyzed. Alice causes Caro's plan to backfire, and Caro is turned into a zombie instead.

Alice and Wesley abandon Jamaica and move back to the United States. The local Police Chief takes Caro into his home and puts her in his bed.
