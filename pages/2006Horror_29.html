'''''Bonesaw''''' is a 2006 American [[Gay pornography|gay pornographic]] [[horror film]]<ref> {{Citation|last = Jones|first = Steve|year = 2009|title = Hard Times and Rough Rides: The Legal and Ethical Impossibilities of Researching 'Shock' Pornographies|last2 = Mowlabocus|first2 = Sharif|publisher = [[Sage Publications]]|journal = [[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]|pages = 616|volume = 12.5|issn = |oclc = |quote = Pornographic film has a long-established tradition of appropriating narratives and motifs from other genres, as titles such as ''Jurassic Pork'' (1995), ''Malcolm XXX'' (1992), or ''In Diana Jones and the Temple of Poon'' (1996) illustrate (see Hunter, 2006). However, films that combine hard-core sex with graphic violence, such as ''[[Porn of the Dead]]'' (2006), ''BoneSaw'' (2006), and ''XXXorcist'' (2006) move beyond parody and generic 'borrowing' to a point where the audience may become uncertain as to exactly what genre of film they are watching – the film being at once 'too horrific' to be porn, and too sexually focused to be horror.|doi=10.1177/1363460709340371}} </ref> written and directed by Jett Blakk.<ref> {{cite book|author = Drewey Wayne Gunn|title = The Gay Male Sleuth in Print and Film: A History and Annotated Bibliography|url = https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780810885899/The-Gay-Male-Sleuth-in-Print-and-Film-A-History-and-Annotated-Bibliography-New-Edition|accessdate = 16 February 2016|year = 2013|publisher = [[Rowman & Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]]|isbn = 9780810885882|page = 333}} </ref><ref> {{cite book|author = Steve Jones|title = Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw|url = http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230319417|accessdate = 16 February 2016|year = 2013|publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn = 9781137317124|page = 217}} </ref> It is based on the 2004 horror film ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' by [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]].<ref> {{cite magazine|author = J.

== Plot ==

A woman returns home from grocery shopping, and has her throat slit by a masked serial killer known as "Bonesaw". Elsewhere, a man named Lee wakes up in Bonesaw's warehouse, and is informed via [[closed-circuit television]]s and the building's sound system that he must win his freedom by surviving a series of intellectual and physical challenges; an [[ankle monitor]] that is capable of delivering electric shocks is used to ensure Lee's compliance.

Lee's first test involves two fellow captives, [[Knights and Knaves|one of whom can only lie, while the other can only tell the truth]]. The two men are forced to have sex in front of Lee, who uses his one allotted question to correctly discern the identities of the duo. While Lee moves on to the next challenge, Bonesaw shoots one of the men and knocks the other out while declaring, "I still need you."

Pat Roberts, a self-proclaimed psychic, calls the Wannell County Police Station to report his precognitive flashes of Bonesaw’s murders, but his visions are dismissed by the skeptical Detective Brown.

Bonesaw's next game involves a caged man who will be released if Lee can solve at least two out of three [[brain teaser]]s. Lee correctly answers only  a single question, but is given a second chance to free the hostage, one that involves bringing the man to orgasm in less than fifteen minutes. Lee is unable to make the man ejaculate in time, and is forced to leave him behind as the room fills with toxic gas.

Pat Roberts meets with Detective Brown in person, and attempts to convince him to investigate an address that he claims is Bonesaw's hideout. Brown instead kicks Roberts out, and has sex with another detective named Larson. Afterward, Larson suggests that Brown look into the address that Roberts provided, explaining that Roberts's "gift" once helped the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] close a homicide case.

For his final challenge, Lee must make two men, both of whom are handcuffed to a pole, orgasm in less than twenty minutes, and do it without stepping outside of a circle that has been drawn on the floor. Lee wins the game, and is allowed to leave by Bonesaw, who kills the other two men with a handgun and a [[circular saw]] while deadpanning, "I said you'd go scot-free, not them".

Brown and Larson reach the warehouse and shoot Bonesaw, unmasking the figure afterward to reveal that it was actually the surviving hostage from Lee's initial challenge, disoriented, gagged, and framed by the real Bonesaw. As Brown laments that he should have listened to Patrick Roberts earlier, a puzzled Larson mentions that Roberts is not a man, but a woman (the one murdered in the intro) whose full given name is Patricia.

A series of flashbacks reveal that both Bonesaw and the impostor Pat Roberts are really James, an ex-boyfriend of Lee's. James locates, comforts, and takes the oblivious Lee to safety, which spurs Lee into asking that they get back together, a request that a smirking James obliges.

== Release ==

Upon being released in 2006, ''Bonesaw'' was rejected by distributors of content for [[pay-per-view]] hotel channels due to being deemed "too violent".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.gayporntimes.com/hardnews/2006/10/15/the-adams-report-by-jc-adams-october-9-15-2006/|title = The Adams Report by J.C.

== Reception ==

XCritic praised the film, categorizing it as "recommended" and writing, "Adonis Productions has released another quality disc with ''Bonesaw''. The production values are high with professional [[videography]], editing, music, and a variety of handsome dudes that cover an age range of early twenties to mid forties: all sexy".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.xcritic.com/review/21765/nbspbobby-williamsnbspbrandon-ironsnbspbrett-matthewsnbspjason-tiyanbspjeremy-spensernbspjett-blakknbspjett-blakknbspkyle-lewisnbspmark-hansfordnbsprob-romoninbsptina-tylernbspty-hudson-bonesaw/|title = ''Bonesaw''|last = X|first = Poindexter|publisher = XCritic|date = 18 May 2006|website = xcritic.com|accessdate = 16 February 2016}} </ref> A similarly positive response to the film was had by Rancho Carne, which wrote, "Certainly an unusual porn video, ''Bonesaw'' is destined to become a gay classic. Its combination of horror, suspense, huge cocks, hunky men, and tight assholes serves up something for everyone. At least, everyone who is interested in steamy, man-on-man sex. While the production values lean toward gore a bit more than desirable, this video somehow escapes [[Camp (style)|cheesiness]] and deserves a round of kudos".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.ranchocarne.com/adult-dvd-reviews.php?id=6621|title = ''Bonesaw''|last = Stud|first = Bear|publisher = Rancho Carne|date = 1 June 2008|website = ranchocarne.com|accessdate = 16 February 2016}} </ref>

Wes Collins of ''[[AVN (magazine)|GayVN]]'', who awarded ''Bonesaw'' a score of 3/5, commended the sex scenes, but was critical of the horror elements, opining that the film was "likely too bloody for general appeal" and that "watching a model get butchered with a saw right after he gets off is a definite turn-off".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://gay.avn.com/movies/66894.html|title = ''Bonesaw''|last = Collins|first = Wes|publisher = ''GayVN''|date = 1 September 2006|website = gay.avn.com|accessdate = 16 February 2016}} </ref> A 2/5 was awarded by Giacomo Tramontagna of ''The Guide'', who was similarly critical of ''Bonesaw'', stating, "To get away with this kind of carnage in gay adult video, more wit is required than perpetrator Jett Blakk is able to inject".<ref> {{cite magazine|author = Giacomo Tramontagna|title = ''Bonesaw''|url = http://archive.guidemag.com/magcontent/invokemagcontent.cfm?ID=E97FA437-A62C-48E3-98A7FBAF8E63C671|magazine = The Guide|location = United States|publisher = |date = September 2006|access-date = 17 February 2016|language = English|volume = 26|issue = 9|page = 85}} </ref>

According to ''GayVN'' contributor Mickey Skee, ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' co-creator [[Leigh Whannell]] expressed to him awareness of both ''Bonesaw'' and fellow gay parody ''Rammer'', quipping, "You know you've made it big when they [[Pornographic parody film|spoof]] you in porn".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://business.avn.com/articles/gay/Gossip-December-2006-29202.html|title = Gossip: December 2006|last = Skee|first = Mickey|publisher = ''GayVN''|date = 8 December 2006|website = business.avn.com|accessdate = 16 February 2016}} </ref>

Rob Romoni and Jett Blakk were nominated for Best Non-Sex Performance and Best Screenplay, respectively, at the 2007 [[Grabby Awards]].
