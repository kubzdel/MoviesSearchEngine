'''''Van Helsing''''' is a 2004 American [[dark fantasy]] [[action film]] written and directed by [[Stephen Sommers]]. It stars [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[vigilante]] monster hunter [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]], and [[Kate Beckinsale]] as Anna Valerious. The film is an homage and tribute to the [[Universal Monsters|Universal Horror Monster]] films from the 1930s and '40s (also produced by [[Universal Studios]] which were in turn based on novels by [[Bram Stoker]] and [[Mary Shelley]]), of which Sommers is a fan.

The eponymous character was inspired by the Dutch vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing from Irish author Bram Stoker's novel ''[[Dracula]]''. Distributed by [[Universal Pictures]], the film includes a number of monsters such as [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster]] and [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|werewolves]] in a way similar to the multi-monster movies that Universal produced in the 1940s, such as ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[House of Dracula]]''.

Despite mostly negative reviews, the film grossed over $300 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In 1887 [[Transylvania]], Doctor [[Victor Frankenstein]] creates a [[Frankenstein's Monster|monster]] with the aid of [[Count Dracula]], who reveals that he plans to use the creature for his own evil plans. Dracula kills the doctor as a mob of villagers storms the castle. His assistant [[Igor (character)|Igor]] escapes, but the villagers chase the monster to an old windmill and set it ablaze. The villagers are scared off by Dracula and his brides, who witness the monster and the doctor's research apparently destroyed by the fire.

One year later, after killing the elusive [[Mr. Hyde]] at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in [[Paris]], monster hunter Van Helsing returns to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in [[Rome]]. He learns that his mission to destroy Dracula and his [[amnesia]] are penance for unremembered sins that cause nightmares. He is tasked with helping the last of an ancient Romanian bloodline, Velkan and Anna Valerious, who must kill Dracula so that their ancestors may enter Heaven. Carl, a [[friar]], provides Van Helsing with aid and weapons. In Transylvania, Velkan is apparently killed during an attempt to trap and kill the [[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|Wolf Man]], and Anna is attacked by Dracula's brides shortly after Van Helsing's arrival. He saves her life and kills Marishka, one of the brides, but as the last of her line, Anna becomes more determined to kill Dracula. In order to protect her, Van Helsing [[sleeping gas|knocks her out]] to prevent her from leaving. She awakens that night and encounters Velkan, who reveals Dracula has a dark secret, but to her horror, he becomes the Wolf Man after having been bitten by the original one earlier and attacks. After she and Van Helsing track him to Frankenstein's castle, they discover that the vampires are attempting to give life to their born-dead children, using Velkan as the source of the power. Van Helsing, dubbed "[[Gabriel]]" by Dracula, realizes they had ties in the past. Van Helsing refuses Dracula's offer to return his memory and escapes. The experiment fails, and the vampire children die, but Velkan turns on Anna as he is consumed by his curse. Van Helsing and Anna escape together.

Under the remains of the old windmill, Van Helsing and Anna encounter Frankenstein's monster. Because he is not evil, Van Helsing cannot allow him to be killed, even though he claims to be key to Dracula's experiment. The Wolf Man witnesses the conversation and escapes to inform Dracula. Meanwhile, Carl discovers a painting that comes to life, depicting a werewolf and a vampire battling. The group travels by carriage to [[Budapest]], luring the remaining brides into a trap and killing Verona. The Wolf Man ambushes the real carriage and bites Van Helsing before being killed. Anna is captured and held as a bargaining chip in exchange for Frankenstein's monster. They hide him in a crypt, but he is taken by the count's undead underlings while Van Helsing and Carl rescue Anna. Returning to the Valerious' castle, Carl discovers an inscription and creates a doorway to the castle. After failing to free Frankenstein's monster from his imprisonment, he lets them know of a cure to lycanthropy that Dracula possesses. Carl determines that the bite of the Wolf Man is the only way to kill Dracula. He and Anna take Igor to find the cure while Van Helsing goes to free Frankenstein's monster. Igor escapes while the final bride, Aleera, beats Anna.  Carl tries delivering the cure to Van Helsing. Igor confronts Carl on a bridge, but the confrontation sends Igor falling to his demise. Frankenstein's monster saves Anna and urges her to help Carl and Van Helsing. She kills Aleera and arrives at the castle. As the Wolf Man, Van Helsing and Dracula battle. Dracula tries reasoning with the Wolf Man, but Van Helsing bites Dracula, who dissolves into a skeleton. Anna bursts in, causing her to be attacked and accidentally killed by Van Helsing, but not before she delivers the cure. Van Helsing returns to normal, stricken with grief over what he has done.

At a funeral pyre, Van Helsing witnesses the spirits of Anna and her family ascending into the clouds while Frankenstein's monster rows away on a raft out to sea. Van Helsing and Carl ride off into the sunset.

===Critical reception===
''Van Helsing'' received mostly negative reviews by critics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-05-10-van-helsing-marketing_x.htm|title=Marketing goes to heroic measures|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2004-05-10|accessdate=2014-10-15}}</ref>  [[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 23% of 213 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 4.2/10.  The site's consensus reads: "A hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload."<ref>{{cite web|title=Van Helsing|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/van_helsing|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 1, 2011|language=en}}</ref>  [[Metacritic]] rated it 35/100 based on 38 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/van-helsing|title=Van Helsing|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2014-10-15}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore"> {{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/ |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave an extremely negative review, rating the film half a star out of four and calling it "the worst would-be summer blockbuster since ''[[Battlefield Earth (film)|Battlefield Earth]]''". Furthermore, he wrote "There are quite a few unintentionally funny moments, although the overall experience was too intensely painful for me to be able to advocate it as being "so bad, it's good." ... Some, however, will doubtless view it as such. More power to them, since sitting through this movie requires something more than a strong constitution and a capacity for self-torture."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/v/van_helsing.html | title = Van Helsing | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | last = Berardinelli | first = James | date = | publisher = ReelViews}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' greatly disliked the film, writing: "Writer-director Stephen Sommers (...) throws together plot strains from various horror movies and stories and tries to muscle things along with flash and dazzle. But his film just lies there, weighted down by a complete lack of wit, artfulness and internal logic. ... What Sommers tries to do here is use action as the only means of involving an audience. So story is sacrificed. Character development is nonexistent, and there are no attempts to incite emotion. Instead, Sommers tries to hold an audience for two hours with nothing up his sleeve but colored ribbons, bright sparklers and a kazoo. What he proves is that this is no way to make movies."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Van-Helsing-a-monstrosity-of-a-movie-2782332.php|title='Van Helsing' a monstrosity of a movie|accessdate=2012-05-09|last=LaSalle|first=Mick|date=May 7, 2004|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' gave the film 3 stars out of 4 stating that "At the outset, we may fear Sommers is simply going for f/x overkill, but by the end, he has somehow succeeded in assembling all his monsters and plot threads into a high-voltage climax. ''Van Helsing'' is silly, spectacular and fun."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/van-helsing-2004|title=Van Helsing|accessdate=2012-05-09|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=May 7, 2004|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

==Spin-offs==
Sommers expanded the story of Van Helsing in two direct spin-offs:

* The animated prequel titled ''[[Van Helsing: The London Assignment]]'' takes place before the main events of the film, focusing on Van Helsing's mission to try to stop [[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]] from terrorizing London.
* There is also a one-shot comic book, published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], titled ''[[Van Helsing: From Beneath the Rue Morgue]]'', that follows Van Helsing on a self-contained adventure that occurs during the events of the film, just after the death of Jekyll/Hyde in Paris but before Van Helsing returned to Rome. In the adventure, Van Helsing deals with [[The Island of Doctor Moreau|Doctor Moreau]] and his hybrid mutants.
