== Cast ==
*Stephen Ohl as Peter
*Jonah Ehrenreich as Tonio

== Production ==
Casting took place in the United States over video.  In the absence of any contracts, Larcuen and the two male leads got tattoos together, which Larcuen reasoned would keep them interested in the project.  The film was shot on an [[iPhone 4S]] in 2011.  Larcuen said that he chose the iPhone because he could not afford to shoot on film, and he did not want to use a cheap digital camera.<ref name=empire/>  Three iPhones were cycled during filming; battery power and storage space were issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yellmagazine.com/interview-stephen-ohl-hooked-up/97594/|title=Interview: Stephen Ohl, Star Of Hooked Up, Found More Than He Bargained For|last=Loeffler|first=Shawn|work=Yell! Magazine|date=2015-03-28|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  ''Hooked up'' had a cinematographer who shot the film traditionally; it was not shot by the actors themselves.  Apple was not involved in the film's production.  Post-production took an extended period of time, as the sound designer, a volunteer, could only work on weekends.<ref name=empire/>

== Reception ==
J. R. Southall of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated it 5/10 and wrote, "This will never be regarded as a great, but it is unexpectedly entertaining and if the iPhone conceit is an indication of things to come, it might have been a lot worse."<ref name=starburst/> Jessy Williams of ''Scream'' rated it 1/5 stars and wrote, "There is nothing in ''Hooked Up'' that is remotely original; it’s basically an extended version of the winged succubus segment from ''[[V/H/S]]'', but not quite as effective."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/hooked-up-film-review/|title=HOOKED UP: Film Review|last=Williams|first=Jessy|work=Scream|date=2015-03-21|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  Patrick Cooper of [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, "Though it certainly goes in an unexpected direction, ''Hooked Up''{{'}}s end fails to make an impact. If you can make it past the painful first 20 minutes, I’d say it’s definitely worth renting solely for the great middle chunk."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3333663/review-hooked/|title=[Review] iPhone Shot 'Hooked Up' Is a Mixed Bag of Horror|last=Cooper|first=Patrick|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2015-02-25|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  Matt Boiselle of [[Dread Central]] rated it 0.5/5 stars and wrote, "do yourselves a colossal favor and bypass this 'hook-up' at all costs".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/93670/hooked-up-2015/|title=Hooked Up (2015)|last=Boiselle|first=Matt|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2015-03-20|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  Michael DeFillipo of Horror Society rated it 6.7/10 and called it "a pretty solid flick" with a boring lead-up and poor plot twist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorsociety.com/2015/02/21/review-hooked-up/|title=Review: Hooked Up|last=DeFellipo|first=Michael|work=Horror Society|date=2015-02-15|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  HorrorTalk rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that "it's not all bad, and it's competently directed", but it "doesn't offer anything new".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/movie-reviews/5366-hooked-up-movie-review.html|title=''Hooked Up'' Movie Review|work=HorrorTalk|date=2015-03-30|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>
