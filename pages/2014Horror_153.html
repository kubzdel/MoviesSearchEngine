== Reviews ==
Steven W. Alloway of FANBASE PRESS CONTRIBUTOR says It’s not a film for everyone. But, if you like dystopian stories and dysfunctional characters, you may enjoy Pink Zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fanbasepress.com/index.php/blogs/steven-w-alloway/item/3888|title='PINK ZONE:’ FILM REVIEW|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> Francis Cabrico, writer at CREATORS.CO said that the way Benjamin Walter, PINK ZONE's Director/Writer/Producer/DP (we should call him a "super auteur" !), shot the movie is a total uppercut to the face. It's fresh, bold and highly stylized drama. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/posts/2086802|title=PINK ZONE and the new wave of Art House B movies|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref>
