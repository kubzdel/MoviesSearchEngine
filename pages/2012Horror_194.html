== Production notes ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
* In a commentary, Jimmy ScreamerClauz noted that he was high on pot cookies while making the film.
* He also said that the first chapter, "''Tainted Milk"'' was originally written and recorded as a black comedy parody of ''[[Lassie]]''. He even placed a [[laugh track]] at the comedic scenes. But once he reached the editing phase and realized how off putting the models and animation were, he changed the score and some of the dialogue to give it a darker edge and make it feel more "bi-polar". After "Tainted Milk" was complete he began work on the other two segments but tried to treat them more like serious horror films and use less comedic elements, though he has stated that he tried to inject a little humor into each short. But due to the statements being taken out of context, a rumor began that the entire film was a failed attempt at a comedy.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2095004/faq?ref_=tt_faq_1#.2.1.1 FAQ for Where the Dead Go to Die], [[IMDB]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E32rpG3cMLc |title=The Royale Reel Rundown - Interview with Jimmy ScreamerClauz |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jason Ours |url=http://www.fromdusktillcon.com/content/reviews/165-reviews-showcase/2129-brundlefly-s-cinema-holocaust-an-impossible-attempt-to-describe-insanity-a-look-at-where-the-dead-go-to-die-director-jimmy-screamerclauz-interview |title=Brundlefly'S Cinema Holocaust: An Impossible Attempt To Describe Insanity - A Look At 'Where The Dead Go To Die' + Director Jimmy Screamerclauz Interview |publisher=Fromdusktillcon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/cgi-bin/articlecreditsb.pl?jimmyscreamerclauz%283-12%29 |title=(re)Search my Trash |publisher=Search my Trash |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref>
