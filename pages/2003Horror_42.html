==Plot==
Structurally, ''Gozu'' is a succession of bizarre scenes sandwiched between a storyline involving Minami’s search for his Yakuza brother Ozaki in a small town, that is reminiscent of the episodic quests in [[Greek Mythology]].<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8898-2004Sep9.html |title='Gozu': Weird Fellas |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2004-09-10 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref>
