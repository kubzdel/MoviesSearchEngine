===Filming===
Filming for ''Spike'' took place just off the [[Angeles Crest Highway]], high in the mountains of the [[Angeles National Forest]], entirely at night in the spring of 2007<ref>{{cite news | author = Staci Layne | url = http://www.horror.com/php/article-1685-1.html | title = Robert Beaucage Interview | work = Horror.com | date = 2008-06-05 | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref> (in locations that burned down two years later in the [[2009 California wildfires#Los Angeles County|Station Fire]]).<ref>{{cite news | url = http://emmablackwood.blogspot.com/2010/05/so-my-friend-made-movie-and-its.html | title = A Garden of Man-Eating Plants and Scary Movies | work = Emma Blackwood | date = 2010-05-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-31}}</ref>  Treacherous terrain and temperatures dropping below 15&nbsp;°F, well below freezing, made filming difficult, and delays were caused by rain, snow, and even hail.<ref>{{cite news | author = Sean Decker | url = http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=3981 | title = First Set Report, Pics from Spike | work = [[Fangoria]] | date = 2007-03-29 | accessdate = 2008-04-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080210080012/http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=3981 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-10}}</ref>  [[Robert Beaucage]] directed the film from a screenplay he was inspired to write by the stories of "[[Cupid and Psyche]], [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]]...

He chose to shoot on 16&nbsp;mm film rather than a [[Digital data|digital]] format, despite the production's tight schedule and low budget, in order to give the film a different "feel" from the typical contemporary [[independent film|indie]] movie,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror-news.php?id=7269 | title = Beauty & the Beast + Blood and Guts = Spike | work = HorrorMovies.ca | date = 2007-01-11 | accessdate = 2010-04-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120314024900/http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror-news.php?id=7269 | archivedate = 2012-03-14 | df =  }}</ref> the overwhelming majority of which are shot digitally.<ref>{{cite news | author = Peter Broderick | url = http://www.peterbroderick.com/writing/writing/ultralowbudgetmoviemaking.html | title = Ultra-Low Budget Moviemaking: The 2002 All Digital Model | work = [[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] | date = Fall 2002 | accessdate = 2010-04-16}}</ref>

===Design===
Seeking a more natural look (rather than [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]) for the film's [[special effect]]s, Beaucage chose veteran concept artist and sculptor [[Jordu Schell]] to create the unique design of ''Spike'''s title character,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.horrorverdict.com/horror_7269.html | title = Beauty & the Beast + Blood and guts = Spike | work = HorrorVerdict.com | date = 2007-01-11 | accessdate = 2010-02-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> which Schell worked into his schedule even while concurrently shaping the design of the [[Pandoran biosphere#Naʼvi|Na'vi]] with [[James Cameron]] for ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://io9.com/5354315/avatar-concept-designer-reveals-the-secrets-of-the-navi | title = Avatar Concept Designer Reveals the Secrets of the Na'vi | work = [[io9]] | accessdate = 2010-04-16}}</ref>

===Critical analysis===
When first released, ''Spike'' was referred to by ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'' as a film that "overturns [[genre]] conventions to explore the darker side of fairytale [[mythology]]",<ref>{{cite news | url = http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/article/8059-edinburgh-international-film-festival-announces-under-the-radar-events/ | title = Edinburgh International Film Festival Announces 'Under the Radar' Events | work = [[The List (magazine)|The List]] | date = 2008-04-28 | accessdate = 2010-04-17}}</ref> and the ''[[All Movie Guide]]'' called it a "dark fairy tale that's not for the faint of heart".<ref>{{cite news | author = Jason Buchanan | url = http://www.allmovie.com/work/spike-461310 | title = Spike | work = [[All Movie Guide]] | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>  [[Calum Waddell]], a film critic for magazines such as ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' and ''[[Fangoria]]'', called ''Spike'' "assured and stylish... a promising debut" and praised its "mix of [[David Lynch]], The [[Brothers Grimm]], and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]", while adding a reservation that the film "does not seem to know what it wants to be".<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Calum Waddell]] | url = http://totalscifionline.com/reviews/2323-spike | title = Spike | work = [[Dreamwatch|Total Sci-Fi]] | accessdate = 2010-04-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110728065359/http://totalscifionline.com/reviews/2323-spike | archivedate = 2011-07-28 | df =  }}</ref>  Others were more positive, such as the ''[[North Adams Transcript]]'' which wrote about the film's "artful" exploration of "both the tenderness and madness of monsters, as well as the many faces of [[love]]—most importantly, the destructive ones"<ref>{{cite news | author = John E.
