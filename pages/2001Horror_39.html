'''''The Forsaken''''' is a 2001 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[J. S. Cardone]], and starring [[Kerr Smith]], [[Brendan Fehr]], [[Izabella Miko]], and [[Jonathan Schaech]]. The film follows a young film editor on a cross-country trip who comes across a hitchhiker and a disoriented young woman in the [[Arizona]] [[Sonoran Desert|desert]] who are connected to a cult of [[vampire]]s.

==Plot==
Sean is driving cross country from [[Los Angeles]] to his sister's wedding in [[Miami]] when he picks up Nick, a hitchhiker who happens to be a [[vampire]] hunter hunting a group of vampires led by Kit, one of the Forsaken; a group of French Knights of the [[First Crusade]] who made a pact with the fallen angel [[Abaddon]] to live forever. There were nine knights: eight were turned into vampires and became known as the Forsaken; the ninth was a sacrifice to Abaddon to seal the pact. Of the eight, four are dead, one is in Europe, one in Africa, and two in the United States (including the one Nick is tracking, Kit). Nick was bitten and "infected" by a vampire but, thanks to an antiviral drug cocktail, the vampire "[[virus]]" is kept at bay. Each of the Forsaken carry a unique strain of vampirism and killing the Forsaken kills the entire bloodline; killing all the vampires descended from it, and stopping anyone just bitten from turning, which is why Nick is hunting this particular Forsaken.  He believes him to be the one that his bloodline is descended from and that if he kills him, he will be cured before he turns (as the drug cocktail eventually will lose effect). At first Sean is less than willing to indulge his new acquaintance; however, he is convinced after the two come across a disoriented young woman, Megan, at a [[diner]], who was bitten by the vampires and left for dead. Nick also proves he is telling the truth by killing a vampire, Teddy, with exposure to sunlight.

Sean and Nick take Megan to their motel room, but she goes into a rage and bites Sean; they realize they must kill the Forsaken responsible to prevent Sean the virus from progressing. Forsaken can only be slain on hallowed ground, so the three head for a Spanish mission 60 miles away – chased by the vampires and their day driver Penn. After a battle on the road, Penn is killed and the car is running out of gas as its tank was shot so they are unable to reach the mission. They stop at a gas station where an old woman, Ina, lets them in. She shows them a newspaper connecting Megan to a bloodbath in Arizona; when Megan wakes up and is coherent enough to talk, she explains she was a victim of the vampires' bloodbath (led by Kit) and after Kit bit her he left Teddy to kill her, which she did not do. Kit and Cym then catch up to them and lay siege to the gas station.

Sean discovers a graveyard outside and Ina explains that it is an old Spanish graveyard that was never dug up, making the house hallowed ground and thus a suitable place to kill Kit. In the following battle, Sean blows off Cym's head with Ina's shotgun but both he and Nick are injured and Kit forces him to be his new day driver then goes after Ina and Megan. As Kit is about to kill them Sean drives his car through the gas station wall and pins Kit to the wall, hoping to hold him there until the sun rises. Kit pushes the car back when it runs out of gas due to the hole in the tank but Sean then shoots him, knocking him into a beam of sunlight and shoots him again when he manages to escape the light. As Kit starts to combust, Sean, Nick, Megan and Ina flee the gas station; Kit's explosive death ignites the gas. It seems Sean and Megan are finally cured of vampirism, however Nick is not cured as it turns out that the vampire who bit him is descended from the other Forsaken in the United States. Nick takes to the road to try to find and kill the other Forsaken, leaving a letter of thanks for Sean. Three months later, Sean catches up to him driving Kit's car and insists on helping, having discovered that the Forsaken is probably in [[Denver]]. The two set off for Denver.

Contemporary critics of the film have noted a [[homoerotic]] [[subtext]] between the film's two central male characters.<ref name="cc">{{cite web|url=http://culturecrossfire.com/movies-tv/movies/it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time-the-forsaken-2001/#.VyVbKGPiTzI|work=Culture Crossfire|title=It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time: The Forsaken|date=September 14, 2013|accessdate=April 30, 2016|author=Howell, Joseph}}</ref> In a 2013 retrospective on the film, the publication ''Culture Crossfire'' said of the film: "Twelve years later, there’s nothing about ''The Forsaken'' that’s particularly memorable other than the fact that it’s an in-denial [[coming out]] tale that just happens to have vampires."<ref name="cc"/>

==Production==
Director J.S. Cardone was influenced by [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' (1977) and [[Kathryn Bigelow]]'s vampire film ''[[Near Dark]]'' (1987) when writing ''The Forsaken'', and said he wanted to make a "[[road film|road movie]]" with vampires.<ref name=commentary/> Kerr Smith was cast in the film based on his performance as Jack McPhee, a gay teenager on the network series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]''; Brendan Fehr was cast based on his role in the sci-fi series ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]''.<ref name=commentary/> Cardone cast Izabella Miko in the role of Megan, who at the time was new to the film industry.<ref name=commentary/> To prepare for the role, Miko, who is originally from [[Poland]], completed accent training in order to achieve an American accent.<ref name=commentary/>

The film was shot on location in and around [[Yuma, Arizona]].<ref name=commentary>{{cite av media|format=DVD|medium=[[Audio commentary]]|people=Cardone, J.S.|title=The Forsaken|publisher=Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|year=2001}}</ref>

==Reception==
''The Forsaken'' holds a 7% approval rating on the internet review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 54 reviews.<ref name=rotten>{{cite web|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|title=The Forsaken|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/forsaken/reviews/|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}</ref>

Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' said of the film: "Like the recent ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''The Forsaken'' supplies its own twist, and also like that other film it comes as less of a surprise than a bewilderment. I'll refrain from spelling it out, though I'll note that the Crusades have something to do with it and it handily doubles as an AIDS metaphor. Who'da thunk it?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2001-05-04/141731/|work=The Austin Chronicle|title=The Forsaken|series=Film Calendar|author=Savlov, Marc|date=May 4, 2001|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also gave the film a negative review, calling it "startlingly amateurish."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2001/05/02/forsaken|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=The Forsaken|date=May 2, 2001|accessdate=April 30, 2016|author=Fretts, Bruce}}</ref> 

Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave a middling review of the film, calling it a "reasonably smart generic hybrid," but that it "trots out its full arsenal of shock tactics far too early in the game and squanders the suspense it has accumulated."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E6DB1039F93BA15757C0A9679C8B63&partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes|work=The New York Times|title=FILM REVIEW; A Throatful Of Vampires, Defanged|author=Holden, Stephen|date=April 28, 2001|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}</ref> Wesley Morris of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote: "As anonymous vampire flicks go, ''The Forsaken'' is like a store-bought costume with plastic fangs collecting dust in a [[Wal-Mart]] "Everything Must Go" bin. Imagine a tributary of ''Dawson's Creek'' snaking into the cesspool area of the [[Styx (band)|Styx]], and you might be able to glean a vision of ''The Forsaken'' for yourself."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title='Forsaken' for a reason / Vampire movie is bargain-bin fare | url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Forsaken-for-a-reason-Vampire-movie-is-2925687.php|author=Morris, Wesley|date=April 28, 2001|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref> 

[[Maitland McDonagh]] of ''[[TV Guide]]'' called the film a "hip, revisionist horror picture, which borrows liberally — and cannily — from ''[[Near Dark]]'' and ''[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-forsaken/review/135160/|work=TV Guide|author=McDonagh, Maitland|title=The Forsaken|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}</ref> Neil Smith of the [[BBC]] awarded the film three out of five stars, but noted that the film "plays down the more lurid aspects of the vampire legend—no fangs, crucifixes or silver bullets—in an attempt to free the genre from its gothic roots. The problem is he inadvertently removes everything that makes the horror genre fun."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[BBC]]|author=Smith, Neil|title=The Forsaken|date=September 4, 2001|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/09/04/the_forsaken_2001_review.shtml|accessdate=December 22, 2017|archivedate=December 30, 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230130442/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/09/04/the_forsaken_2001_review.shtml}}</ref>
