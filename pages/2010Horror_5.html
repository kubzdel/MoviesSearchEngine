==Reception==
''Alice in Murderland'' received negative reviews from [[Film criticism|film critics]] and many horror fans. Criticisms focused on the poor quality of the Jabberwockey's costume, lack of screen-time for the [[Title role|titular character]], perceptions of characters as insincere and fake, numerous shots in which film crew and equipment are clearly visible, the identity of the Jabberwocky killer, the throwaway characterizations of Matt and Andrew who had less than five minutes of screentime each, the repetitive [[soundtrack]], and the misrepresentation of the film on the DVD cover. However, despite these criticisms the ''Alice in Murderland'' concept has developed a [[cult following]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Alice in Murderland I|url=http://www.wattpad.com/495398-alice-in-murderland-i-under-revision-alice-in|work=Wattpad|publisher=WP Technology Inc.|accessdate=3 May 2012|author=Rayvin|format=Story}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Alice in Murderland Proof copy|url=http://www.jasperfforde.com/competition/alice.html|website=jasperfforde.com|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>
