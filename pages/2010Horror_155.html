==Plot==
"Sexual parasites, disembowelment, zombies, serial killers, demon children, violent vixens, rabid office workers, aliens, mummies, skeleton warriors, vampires, werewolves, dragons, medusa, beasts, giants, robots, cyclops' and angry embryos all spring to life from the flesh covered sketch books featured in Anthony G. Sumner’s ([[Gallery of Fear]]) Slices of Life.

Mira (Kaylee Williams) awakens in front of a seedy roadside motel with amnesia. She searches for clues to her identity in the pages of three bound sketchbooks, in which each book represents a different aspect of everyday life, maybe her life.

WORK LIFE<br/>
A lowly clerk at a nano technology firm unleashes a deadly virus at the office headquarters, giving new meaning to the term corporate zombie.

HOME LIFE<br/>
As local girls begin to disappear, a young pregnant woman is haunted by visions of evil demonic children hell bent on stealing her unborn fetus.

SEX LIFE<br/>
A young brother and sister on the run from a sexually abusive home life, take refuge in a countryside Victorian manor- only to discover the monsters hidden in this house have been looking for a new home.

Convinced that the characters from these books are roaming around the motel, Mira’s reality begins to crumble. Are these visions real or is she going insane? Desperate, Mira turns to the motel caretakers (Marv Blauvelt and Helene Alter-Dyche), only to discover the true evil bound in the flesh covered books and the destiny they hold for her.<br/>
At home… at work… at play… terror is never far away."<ref name=Gore/>

The teaser trailer for the full film was applauded in the review by Christopher Stipp of Slash Films on April 23, 2010.  Stipp said
"Director and co-writer Anthony G. Sumner, along with writers Alan Rowe Kelly and Eric Richter, brings a story that feels more like a compendium than it does one single film. Feeling like a cross between Freddy’s Nightmares, Monsters, and Tales from the Darkside, the trailer just roars right out of the gate with nothing more than a close-up of a phonograph being used and a lovely young fräulein splayed out on some grass, the camera turning slowly. It’s haunting and I love it because we’re given zero information about what’s going on in front of us. No interstitial, no voiceover, nothing to indicate what it is we’re seeing. <br>I appreciate that this trailer is able to get me excited in much the same way the idea of [[Trick 'r Treat]] did when it came out. I have a fondness for short story horror and this movie looks like it can capture that same sensibility if it can be as good as this trailer is."<ref name=Stipp>{{Cite web
