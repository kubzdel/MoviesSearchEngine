'''''Flesh for the Beast''''' is a 2003 fantasy-horror film directed and written by Terry M. West. The movie was released on September 27, 2003 and surrounded a group of [[parapsychologists]] that investigate a haunted mansion and end up finding more than they intended. A graphic novel [[tie-in]] was released the following year through [[Media Blasters]].

==Synopsis==
A group of parapsychologists are called in to investigate a mansion with a reputation for being haunted, as it was previously a [[brothel]] where many men would go missing. One of the investigators, Erin Cooper (Jane Scarlett) finds herself particularly drawn to the place. As the night progresses the group discovers that they are not alone and that three [[succubus|succubi]] inhabit the house, imprisoned by a warlock's amulet. The amulet would give its user the ability to control the succubi, giving them extreme amounts of power. The succubi kill the group members one by one as the group tries desperately to discover the amulet's whereabouts and perform a ritual that would stop the succubi. However the survivors are eventually pared down to two people, one of which is killed while trying to begin the ritual after finding the amulet. The survivor, Erin, is then revealed to have been a succubus all along. She had been the warlock's favorite and somehow had lost her memories and gained the ability to leave the mansion. Erin then rejoins the other succubi in the mansion.

==Graphic novel==
On October 26, 2004 a graphic novel tie-in was released through Media Blasters. The book did not adapt the movie, but instead consisted of several stories that centered around the succubi's life in the mansion. The stories ranged in tone from horror to comedy, and were mostly [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] episodes that did not reference one another. The only exception was one story that referenced one of the other comics, as one story surrounded a succubi that had gotten pregnant due to her falling in love with a college professor.
