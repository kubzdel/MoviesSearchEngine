'''''Dahmer''''' is a 2002 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[horror film]] directed by [[David Jacobson (director)|David Jacobson]] and starring [[Jeremy Renner]] as the [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]] [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], a mentally-unstable recluse in Wisconsin, who captured 17 men.

There are two timelines in the film: The "present" of the film runs in ordinary chronological order covering the period of one-to-two days; the flashbacks go in reverse order, and Dahmer is seen as successively younger until the film arrives at his first murder and the aftermath.

==Plot==
[[Jeffrey Dahmer]] ([[Jeremy Renner]]) is a shy and socially awkward factory worker in [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Troubled by a turbulent childhood and his religious father's denial of his [[homosexuality]], Dahmer begins luring attractive young men to his home, where he conducts experiments on his victims before he murders them, trying to create a living zombie. 

[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]] scenes from Dahmer's earlier life reveal that he killed one man this way in [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath]], [[Ohio]] when he was a teenager. They also reveal his troubled relationship with his father, and Jeffrey's [[alcoholism]]. In the present, he rationalizes his crimes in Milwaukee over the [[divorce]] of his parents and his emotionally isolated childhood; nevertheless, he can't stop inviting more and more young men from bars and clubs to his home, where he successively kills them. 

Jeffrey meets a young man named Rodney and invites him to his house with plans of murdering him, but as the night goes on and the conversations get more personal Jeffrey is faced with an emotional crisis. Rodney confesses his romantic feelings for Jeffrey, but finds him evasive. During the course of their evening together, Jeffrey strangles him with a belt until he loses consciousness; however, Rodney survives, and escapes the apartment. The film ends with a flashback to Jeffrey as a teenager, riding in a car with his father on the way to a therapy session, [[cross-cutting|cross-cut]] with a scene in which he dissects one of his victims on his bed.

Although the script recreates actual events, the names are changed out of respect for Dahmer's victims. In reality, the escapee who led to Dahmer's capture was Tracy Edwards, portrayed by Artel Kayàru as Rodney, and Dahmer's first victim was a man named Stephen Hicks, portrayed in the film by [[Matt Newton]] as Lance Bell. Production took place in [[Los Angeles]] and one scene in [[Milwaukee]]. The mask special effects were created by Christien Tinsley and Kelley Mitchell, who were involved two years later in the makeup of [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.

==Reception==
''Dahmer ''has received mostly mixed to positive reviews. It currently holds a 68% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|dahmer|Dahmer}}</ref>

Stephen Holden of The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the film a mixed review, praising Renner's performance and the supporting performances, but said the film "falls headlong into the trap of imagining that it can somehow rationalize the monstrous."<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|author=Holden, Stephen|date=June 21, 2002|accessdate=December 28, 2016|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9803eeda113bf932a15755c0a9649c8b63|title=FILM REVIEW; Trying to Make Sense of the Irrational}}</ref> Carla Meyer of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film a middling review, writing: "Filmmaker David Jacobson doesn't seem to know where to go with his version. He approaches crass exploitation by juxtaposing scenes of carnage with shots of chocolate spilling into a vat (Dahmer worked in a candy factory). Other moments carry real suspense and emotional weight."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Lukewarm-attempt-to-explain-serial-killer-Jeffrey-2797286.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 12, 2002|accessdate=December 28, 2016|title=Lukewarm attempt to explain serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised Renner's performance writing that he "imbues Jeffrey Dahmer with a very solemn desolation that looks just enough like ”normal” pain to let you in on the way that this repressed, lonely freak could pass himself off as just another sad-eyed outcast."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2002/07/10/dahmer/|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Dahmer|date=July 10, 2002|accessdate=December 28, 2016|author=Gleiberman, Owen}}</ref>

Shawn Levy of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' gave the film a positive review, noting: "Writer-director David Jacobson and his star, Jeremy Renner, have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted."<ref>{{cite news|first=Shawn|last=Levy|work=The Oregonian|title=Review: "Dahmer"|date=September 6, 2002|page=21}}</ref>

[[Kathryn Bigelow]] said that she cast Renner in ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' because of his performance in ''Dahmer''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeremy Renner, Breakout Star Of 'The Hurt Locker'|date=  February 24, 2010|publisher=[[NPR]]|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/02/24/123966423/jeremy-renner-breakout-star-of-the-hurt-locker|accessdate= March 23, 2016}}</ref>
