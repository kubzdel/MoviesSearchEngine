'''''Paranormal Activity''''' is a 2007 American [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[supernatural horror film]] written, co-produced, photographed, edited, and directed by [[Oren Peli]]. It is the first (chronologically, the third) entry into the [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|''Paranormal Activity'' film series]]. The film centers on a young couple, Katie ([[Katie Featherston]]) and Micah ([[Micah Sloat]]) are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home. It is presented as a series cameras set up by the couple in an attempt to document what is haunting them. The film is notable for being the first widely released film to be shot entirely on cell phone cameras. The film sets up found-footage conventions that were mirrored in the later films of the series.

Originally developed as an [[Independent film|independent feature]] and given film festival screenings in 2007, the film was acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] and modified, particularly with a new ending. It was given a limited U.S. release on September 25, 2009, and then a nationwide release on October 16, 2009. The film earned nearly $108 million at the U.S. box office and a further $85 million internationally for a worldwide total of $193 million.<ref name="thenumbers">{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2009/PNACT.php|title=''Paranormal Activity''|work=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref> Paramount/DreamWorks acquired the U.S. rights for $350,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312937,00.html|title=Meet the Stars of ''Paranormal Activity''|first=Missy|last=Schwartz|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-16}}</ref> It is the most profitable film ever made, based on [[return on investment]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Frankel |first=Daniel |url=http://www.thewrap.com/article/paranormal-now-most-profitable-film-ever-9335?page=1 |title='Paranormal' Now the Most Profitable Film Ever |work=The Wrap |date= |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2009/1030/how-paranormal-activity-became-the-most-profitable-movie-ever |title=How 'Paranormal Activity' became the most profitable movie ever|last=O'Carroll|first=Eoin|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/30/paranormal-activity-oren-peli |title=Paranormal Activity director's new film snapped up|work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Brooks |first=Xan |date= 2009-11-30|accessdate=2010-02-24 | location=London}}</ref> although such figures are difficult to verify independently<ref>{{cite news|author=Tom Shone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/25/paranormal-activity-box-office-profit |title=Paranormal Activity and the myth of the shoestring shocker &#124; Film |work=The Guardian |date= 2009-11-25|accessdate=2010-02-24 | location=London}}</ref> as this is likely to exclude marketing costs.<ref>{{cite web|author=Friday |url=http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-the-most-profitable-movie-ever.html |title='Paranormal Activity' The Most Profitable Movie Ever |work=Get The Big Picture |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref>

A parallel [[sequel]] and prequel ''[[Paranormal Activity 2]]'', was released on October 22, 2010. The success of the first two films would spawn additional films in the series: the [[prequel]] ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'', released on October 21, 2011, and sequel to the second installment, ''[[Paranormal Activity 4]]'', released on October 19, 2012, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] titled ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones]]'' released on January 3, 2014 and the fifth and final installment ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension]]'' released on October 23, 2015.

==Plot==
<!-- Please, only add to this synopsis if you spot a mistake or grammatical error. -->
Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in [[San Diego]]. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous [[psychic]] Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact [[Demonology|demonologist]] Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.

The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a [[Ouija board]]. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.

Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles [[baby powder]] in the hallway and bedroom. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the [[Paranormal Activity 2|second film]]). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.

The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house, he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.

<!--THIS IS THE THEATRICAL ENDING-->
The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black. [[Epilogue]] text states that Micah's body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and [[Paranormal Activity 2|Katie's whereabouts remain unknown]].
<!--This is the ending of the theatrical 'final cut' version-->

===Alternate endings===
Once Paramount acquired the film, the original ending was scrapped, and two new endings were developed for the film, one of them being the one seen in theaters (the scrapped ending was shown at only one public viewing).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.horrorsquad.com/2009/10/11/so-what-was-paranormal-activitys-original-ending/|title=So What Was 'Paranormal Activity's Original Ending?|last=Goss|first=William|website=Horror Squad |date=2010-01-31|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/10/09/oren-peli-paranormal-activity-interview/|title=Interview: Oren Peli, Writer-Director of 'Paranormal Activity'|last=Hall|first=Peter|date=2009-10-09|work=Cinematical|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref>

====Original====
Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, saying that she is concerned because she hasn't heard from Katie or Micah. Amber eventually comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber out of the house before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth.

Police officers arrive at the house about a half hour later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her [[catatonic]] state and seems confused. Katie comes out of the bedroom with the knife still in her hand, the police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officers slams shut, startling one of the officers, which causes him to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with the police investigating the area and finding nothing but the camera, still running.

====Paramount alternate ending====
In this ending, available as alternate ending on the home releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera before cutting her own throat. The screen then fades to black.

====Unfilmed alternate ending====
A third alternate ending was written in which a possessed Katie would corner Micah and bludgeon him to death with his camera, while viewers watch from the camera's point of view. This version was deemed too complicated and too brutal to shoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert |title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!) |last=Schwartz |first=Missy |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2016-09-01}}</ref>

==Production==
Attempting to focus on believability rather than action and gore, Peli chose to shoot the picture with a home video camera. In deciding on a more raw and stationary format (the camera was almost always sitting on a tripod or something else) and eliminating the need for a camera crew, a "higher degree of plausibility" was created for the audience as they were "more invested in the story and the characters".<ref name="interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/slamdancenews.php?id=5123 | title=Exclusive Interview: Oren Peli| first=Ryan |last=Turek | date=2008-03-09 | accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> Peli says that the dialogue was "natural" because there was no real script. Instead, the actors were given outlines of the story and situations to improvise, a technique known as "[[retroscripting]]" also used in the making of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.<ref name="interview" /> In casting the movie, Peli auditioned "a few hundred people" before finally meeting Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat. He originally auditioned them individually and later called them back to audition together. Peli was impressed with the chemistry between the actors, saying, "If you saw the [audition] footage, you would've thought they had known each other for years."<ref name="interview" /> During a guest appearance on ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' on November 3, 2009, Sloat and Featherston explained they each saw the casting call on LACasting. Featherston noted they were originally paid $500 for their work.

The film was shot out of sequence due to Peli's self-imposed seven-day shooting schedule,<ref name="latimes">{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-paranormal20-2009sep20,0,843011,full.story | title=The haunted history of 'Paranormal Activity'| first=John |last=Horn | accessdate=2009-09-20 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=2009-09-20}}</ref> though Peli would have preferred the story unfold for the actors as he had envisioned it. Sloat, who controlled the camera for a good deal of the film, was a former cameraman at his university's TV station. "It was a very intense week", Peli said, stating that the film would be shot day and night, edited at the same time, and would have the visual effects applied to it as the acting footage was being finalized.<ref name="interview" />  Multiple endings were conceived, but not all of them were shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2009/10/30/paranormal-activity-three-super-scary-alternate-endings-spoiler-alert/|title='Paranormal Activity': Three super-scary alternate endings (SPOILER ALERT!)|last=Schwartz|first=Missy|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-30|accessdate=2014-06-03}}</ref>

The film was screened at 2007's [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]], where it impressed an assistant at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], [[Kirill Baru]], so much that CAA signed on to represent Peli. Attempting to find a distributor for the film and/or directing work for Peli, the agency sent out DVDs of the movie to as many people in the industry as they could, and it was eventually seen by [[Miramax Films]] Senior Executive Jason Blum, who thought it had potential. He worked with Peli to re-edit the film and submitted it to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], but it was rejected. The DVD also impressed [[DreamWorks]] executives Adam Goodman, Stacey Snider, and finally [[Steven Spielberg]], who cut a deal with Blum and Peli.<ref name="latimes" />

DreamWorks' plan was to remake the film with a bigger budget and with Peli directing, and only to include the original version as an extra when the DVD was eventually released. "They didn't know what to do with [the original]", said Blum; they just wanted to be "in business" with Peli.<ref name="latimes" /> Blum and Peli agreed, but stipulated a test screening of the original film before going ahead with the remake, believing it would be well received by a theatrical audience.<ref name="latimes" />

During the screening, people began walking out; Goodman thought the film was [[Box office bomb|bombing]], until he learned that the viewers were actually leaving because they were so frightened. He then realized a remake was unwise.<ref name="latimes" /> [[Paramount Pictures]], which acquired DreamWorks in 2005, bought the domestic rights to the film, and worldwide rights to any sequels, for USD$350,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2009/10/paramount-paranormal-activity-sequel.html | title=Paramount may produce 'Paranormal Activity' sequel | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author=Ben Fritz | date=2009-10-25 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}</ref> When the film was taken in by Paramount, several changes were made. Some scenes were cut, others added, and the original ending was scrapped, with two new endings being shot.<ref name="screen">{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/paranormal-activity-recut-scenes-alternate-endings-kofi-31497/2/|title=Paranormal Activity: Alternate Endings & Recut Scenes|last=Outlaw|first=Kofi|date=2009-10-21|work=Screen Rant|accessdate=2009-10-23}}</ref> The ending shown in theaters during the film's worldwide release is the only one of the three to feature [[visual effects]], and it differs from the endings previously seen at the Screamfest and Burbank screenings.<ref>{{cite web|title='Paranomal' has 'magical elixir' for horror: Realism, subtlety but not gore|work=[[USA Today]]|first=Anthony |last=Breznican|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> The theatrical release was delayed indefinitely because Paramount had put all DreamWorks productions on hold. Meanwhile, a screening for international buyers resulted in the sale of international rights in 52 countries.<ref name="latimes" /> Only after Goodman became production chief at Paramount in June 2009 did the film finally get slated for a fall release.<ref name="latimes" />

==Release==
''Paranormal Activity'' [[premiere]]d at [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] in North America on October 14, 2007, was shown at the [[Slamdance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2008, and screened at the 36th Annual [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 6, 2009.<ref>[http://www.telluridefilmfestival.org/news/2009-09 The 36th Telluride Film Festival Draws to a Close]</ref>

Additionally, at the end of the film, 15 minutes' worth of names were added to the DVD release, as part of a special promotion: the fans who "demanded" the film were asked by email if they wanted to have their name appear as a thank you for the film's success.

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
The film received mostly positive reviews upon release. Based on 192 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 83%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paranormal_activity|title=Paranormal Activity|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 68 out of 100 based on 24 critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paranormal-activity|title=Paranormal Activity|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref>

Film critics [[James Berardinelli]] and [[Roger Ebert]] each awarded it 3.5 stars out of a maximum of 4 stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1822 |title=Reelviews Movie Reviews |work=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref><ref name=ebert>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091007/REVIEWS/910089996 |title=Paranormal Activity |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger|last=Ebert|date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref> Ebert stated in his review, "It illustrates one of my favorite points, that silence and waiting can be more entertaining than frantic fast-cutting and berserk f/x. For extended periods here, nothing at all is happening, and believe me, you won't be bored."<ref name=ebert/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave ''Paranormal Activity'' an A− rating and called it "frightening...freaky and terrifying" and said that "''Paranormal Activity'' scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés."<ref>{{cite news|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20309083,00.html |title=Paranormal Activity|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-02-24}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film 16th in their list of the "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article saying, "Peli deserves props for milking the maximum amount of tension out of the spare, modern setting—an ordinary, cookie-cutter tract home in San Diego. It doesn't sound very scary, but Peli manages to make it terrifying. If you aren't white-knuckling your armrest at least once or twice while watching it, you probably don't have a pulse."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18415|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 2|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>
