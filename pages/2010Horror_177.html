==Plot==
In rural [[Oregon]], at the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital in 1966, a young patient named Tammy is killed by an unseen force at night.

Kristen ([[Amber Heard]]), a troubled young woman, sets fire to an abandoned farmhouse and is arrested. The local police take her to North Bend, where she meets the other patients in the ward: the artistic Iris ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]), the seductive Sarah ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), the wild Emily ([[Mamie Gummer]]), and the child-like Zoey ([[Laura-Leigh]]). Kristen is taken to a room previously occupied by their friend, Tammy. Kristen also meets her therapist, Dr. Stringer ([[Jared Harris]]), and she reveals that she is unable to recall anything about her past. Later, she sees a horribly-deformed figure staring at her in the middle of the night. Kristen is later attacked by the deformed figure, but upon telling the nurse this, she is drugged and put through intense [[electroshock therapy]]. During a session with Dr. Stringer, Iris mentions Tammy but is immediately halted by the doctor.

In a therapy session, Dr. Stringer uses [[hypnotherapy]] to unlock Iris' hidden memories. After the session, Iris is killed by [[transorbital lobotomy]] by the deformed figure. In Iris's sketchbook, Kristen finds a sketch of the figure that had attacked her, with the name ''Alice Hudson'', a former patient at the hospital, written on top. That night, Kristen and Emily attempt to find Iris and escape. However, the alarm is triggered. Kristen is thwarted by Alice, and goes unconscious. She reawakens in her room, and it is revealed that Emily was caught.

Sarah is later electrocuted and killed by Alice. Kristen discovers that all of the girls had killed Alice, led by Tammy, because Alice constantly hurt them. Now Alice is after them for revenge. Emily attempts to commit suicide, thinking she is doomed. Kristen attempts to stop her, but Alice appears and kills Emily by slitting her throat. Kristen plans a last attempt to escape by holding Zoey as a pretend hostage but is drugged and placed in a [[straitjacket]]. However, she escapes it and takes Zoey with her to try and get out. Zoey is captured by Alice and killed off-screen. After a lengthy chase around the hospital, Kristen seemingly manages to destroy Alice. She finds Alice Hudson's patient file in Dr. Stringer's office, which details her treatments and each one of the girls' names, including Kristen herself.

Dr. Stringer, catching Kristen in his office, then reveals that Kristen is actually one of many personalities of the real Alice Hudson. Alice was kidnapped at eleven years old eight years previous. She was left chained up for two months in the basement of the same farmhouse Kristen had burned down; in order to survive the trauma, she developed [[multiple personality disorder]], creating each one of the girls from the Ward as a different personality. Over time, Alice's own personality became so overwhelmed by the others that she became lost. Dr. Stringer attempted experimental techniques to bring Alice's own personality back, resulting in the manifestation of Alice, that was destroying the individual personalities. He explains that her treatments were working until "Kristen" appeared, yet another invention of Alice's mind to protect itself from reliving the trauma at the farmhouse.

Alice's parents come to take her home because she is finally fully treated. Before leaving, Alice takes one last look around her room. Just then, Kristen suddenly comes out and attacks her. The camera cuts to black.

==Cast==
*[[Amber Heard]] as Kristen, the main protagonist. A girl with no memories of her life but the strong belief that she is not crazy. She feels the constant need to escape the ward no matter the cost. She is the first in noticing the other girls are disappearing and that a [[vengeful ghost]] might be the one behind it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18229|title=Amber Heard Shows Some Emotion in 'The Ward' Image|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}</ref>
*[[Mamie Gummer]] as Emily. She is tough and free-spirited but also the one who mostly acts in wild, insane manner, annoys the other patients, and calls everyone crazy, which often starts conflict among girls especially between her and Sarah. Initially, she tries to intimidate and scare Kristen, but eventually, Kristen's strength makes her admire her. She hides a guilty feeling inside her though it seems unlikely she will open to it.
*[[Danielle Panabaker]] as Sarah, a vain, beautiful redhead and the flirtatious one of the group. She flirts with a male nurse but is turned down because she is a mental patient. She often puts down the other girls through her snobbish and snooty disposition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17751|title=Sales Art and First Images from John Carpenter's 'The Ward'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}</ref>
*[[Laura-Leigh]] as Zoey, a girl who has suffered emotional trauma so severe that she keeps acting and dressing like a little girl. She carries around a stuffed rabbit everywhere she goes. She seems oppressed by the others due to her instant trust in Kristen.
*[[Lyndsy Fonseca]] as Iris, artistically talented and prim and proper, she is the first of the girls in befriending Kristen. She is nice and kind to everyone. She also carries a sketchbook where she likes to draw. She seems to be the most aware of their situation in the ward since she explains to Kristen everything about their seclusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34732/new-promo-pic-john-carpenters-the-ward|title=New Promo Pic for John Carpenter's The Ward|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref>
*[[Mika Boorem]] as Alice, a girl who used to be a patient at the ward but is nowhere to be found anymore. Kristen tries to find out what happened to her during her time at the Ward.
*[[Jared Harris]] as Dr. Stringer, the girls' psychiatrist. He seems hopeful in curing Kristen, though his real intentions seem mysterious the whole time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34069/early-art-and-images-john-carpenters-the-ward|title=Early Art and Images: John Carpenter's The Ward|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref>
*[[Sydney Sweeney]] as Young Alice, a young girl who Kristen sees in flashbacks, both hands chained in a cellar. Nothing is really explained about her in the beginning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17956|title=Pre-Production Video Diary for John Carpenter's 'The Ward'|publisher=BloodyDisgusting}}</ref>
*[[Dan Anderson (actor)|Dan Anderson]] as Roy, the chief orderly at the ward. Serious and unpredictable, tries to maintain order inside the ward. He is the main target of Sarah's flirting.
*Susanna Burney as Nurse Lundt, the chief nurse at the ward. Tends to consider Kristen a loose end, and constantly tries to act without the authority of Dr. Stringer.
*[[Sali Sayler]] as Tammy, a girl who disappears from the ward unexpectedly. Her disappearance upsets the other girls. Her empty room is later occupied by Kristen. She is the mastermind behind Alice's "death" at the hands of the girls.
*[[Mark Chamberlin]] as Mr. Hudson, the sad man (as Emily describes him and his wife). They constantly visit the ward and are often seen watching the girls from a window.
*[[Jillian Kramer]] as Monster Alice, the ghost responsible for the disappearances. Using surgical tools as torture means on her victims. Not much is clear about her rather than the fact that she is getting rid of the girls one by one.
