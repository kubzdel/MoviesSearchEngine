==Release==
The film was released in theaters in its native country of [[Iceland]] in September. Due to the lack of horror films and the grindhouse feel to the film, many audience members could not take it seriously, not noticing the subtle hints of comedy throughout the movie. Advertisements, which started with the words "The first Icelandic Thriller" were removed and the producers added in "Should only be seen if you have a sense of humor." E1 Entertainment have picked up UK rights for theatrical distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118008288.html?categoryid=13&cs=1&query=reykjavik+whale+watching+massacre|title=Variety article - E1 takes Reykjavik in UK|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref> and was released on 10 May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36405/exclusive-uk-teaser-harpoon-the-reykjavik-whale-watching-massacre|title=TIFF 2012: New Lords of Salem One-Sheet Sporting Sheri Moon and Her Otis Complex - Dread Central|date=14 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref> The film ran in the UK as Harpoon: The Reykjavik Whale Watching Massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37038/full-uk-trailer-harpoon-the-reykjavik-whale-watching-massacre|title=Massive Film4 FrightFest 2012 Image Gallery and Final Wrap-up! - Dread Central|date=3 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2017}}</ref>
