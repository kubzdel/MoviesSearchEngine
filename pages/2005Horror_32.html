'''''Constantine''''' is a 2005 American [[Occult detective fiction|occult detective]] film directed by [[Francis Lawrence]], in his [[list of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], and starring [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Constantine]].  [[Rachel Weisz]], [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]], and [[Djimon Hounsou]] co-star. With a screenplay by [[Kevin Brodbin]] and [[Frank Cappello]], the film is based on [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Hellblazer]]'' comic book, with plot elements taken from the "[[Dangerous Habits]]" story arc (issues #41{{ndash}}46) and the "Original Sins" story arc. The film portrays John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in [[Hell]] for a suicide attempt in his youth. Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time. With terminal lung cancer, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her twin sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot.

The character of John Constantine was introduced by comic book writer/creator [[Alan Moore]] while writing the ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|Swamp Thing]]'', first appearing there in June 1985.<ref>Markstein, Don. "Don Markstein's Toonopedia: John Constantine". Retrieved 2007-05-31</ref> In 1988, the character of John Constantine was given his own comic book title, ''Hellblazer'', published by [[DC Comics]]. The "Dangerous Habits" story arc was written by [[Garth Ennis]] in 1991.<ref name=shock/>

''Constantine'' was released in the United States and Canada on February 18, 2005, and in [[Hong Kong]] on February 8, 2005. The film grossed $230.9 million worldwide from a $100 million budget.<ref name=mojo/>

==Plot==
<!---Gabriel has been established as androgynous, being neither male nor female. Please keep this in mind as you edit so that you may avoid using terms which would apply to a gender.-->  
[[God]] and [[Lucifer]] have a standing wager for mankind's souls. [[Angel]]s and [[demon]]s are forbidden to manifest on Earth; instead, their hybrid offspring influence humans.

In the Mexican countryside, a scavenger named Manuel finds a spearhead wrapped in a [[Nazi flag]] at the ruins of an old church, which is later revealed as the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]]. Manuel becomes possessed and travels to the United States.

[[John Constantine]] exorcises a [[Filipina]] girl possessed by a demon trying to break through to Earth, which should not be possible under the wager's rules. He meets with the [[androgyny|androgynous]] half-angel being [[List of Hellblazer characters#Archangel Gabriel|Gabriel]]. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer brought forth by prolonged smoking. Gabriel declines, telling Constantine that he exorcises demons for selfish reasons and can not buy his way into Heaven.

After being assaulted by another demon, Constantine goes to Papa Midnite, a reputed [[witch doctor]] who runs a club serving as neutral ground where half-breeds do not have to conceal themselves. Midnite does not believe Constantine's claim of demons crossing over. Constantine leaves, after exchanging hostile words with half-demon Balthazar.

Elsewhere, a woman named Isabel Dodson commits suicide in a psychiatric hospital. Her twin sister, Detective Angela Dodson, refuses to believe that Isabel, a devout Roman Catholic, would kill herself. Watching security footage of Isabel's suicide, Angela hears her say Constantine's name. Angela finds Constantine and asks him to help investigate. After they are attacked by winged demons, which Constantine believes were targeting Angela, he agrees to help.

Constantine briefly transports himself to Hell through the possession of a [[familiar]] and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. Constantine explains to Angela that he can see the true nature of the half-breeds. He attempted suicide to escape his visions but was revived by paramedics; for the sin of taking his own life (he was technically dead for 2 minutes before being revived), his soul is condemned to go to Hell once he dies. The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible that Lucifer's son, [[Mammon]], will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God.

Angela tells Constantine that Isabel, a clairvoyant and a psychic, was [[Involuntary commitment|committed]] by her parents. Angela had the same gift but suppressed it. At Angela's insistence, Constantine reawakens her psychic ability through a [[near death experience]]. She immediately finds a clue pinpointing Balthazar as an accomplice to the plot; Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that Mammon has the Spear, stained with the [[blood of Christ]] — the assistance from God. Angela, now the psychic in place of Isabel, is abducted by an invisible entity.

Constantine convinces Midnite that the demons are breaking the wager's rules. With Midnite's help, Constantine finds out how the Spear emerged and Angela's location. Constantine arms himself and goes to the hospital, accompanied by his driver and apprentice [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Kramer]]. The two fight their way through an army of half-demons to exorcise Angela. Chas is killed by the invisible entity, which turns out to be Gabriel. Resenting God's favoritism towards humans, Gabriel plans to unleash Hell on Earth to weed out those deemed "unworthy" of God's love. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and prepares to use the Spear to cut Mammon free from Angela.

Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him. Confronted by Lucifer, Gabriel threatens to 'smite' him in God's honor; however, the attack towards Lucifer comes up short, revealing to both Gabriel and Lucifer that Gabriel no longer has divine protection. Lucifer proceeds to burn Gabriel's wings, making Gabriel mortal. Lucifer banishes Mammon back to Hell and grants Constantine any wish; Constantine asks that Isabel be released to Heaven. Lucifer complies but realizes too late that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence; by selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, hoping he will eventually damn himself again. Angela and Constantine depart, leaving the now human Gabriel. Sometime later, Constantine, now making an effort to quit smoking, entrusts the Spear to Angela and visits Chas' grave, where Chas appears in an angelic form and flies away.

==Cast==
* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Constantine]], a chain-smoking cynic with the ability to perceive the true [[wikt:visage|visage]] of half-angels and half-demons on the human [[Astral plane|plane]]. John is damned to Hell for attempting suicide—a mortal sin—and has [[Lung cancer#Prognosis|terminal lung cancer]].
* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Angela Dodson, a troubled Los Angeles Police Department Detective investigating the suicide of her twin sister, Isabel (also portrayed by Weisz). Weisz also plays Mammon, the son of Lucifer who has no patience for his father's rule of Hell and uses Angela's body as a means of escaping Hell to rule over Earth himself.
* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as [[Chas Chandler (comics)|Chas Kramer]], John Constantine's driver and student. Chas has a strong interest in the occult and helps John whenever possible in order to gain knowledge and experience from him.
* [[Tilda Swinton]] as [[Gabriel]], a "half-breed" angel, depicted as looking [[Androgyny|androgynous]],  with a [[Misanthropy|disdain for humanity]] who plots to set Mammon free from Hell to unleash demon kind on the Earth.
* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Father Hennessy, an [[insomnia]]c, alcoholic priest with the ability to [[Mediumship|communicate with the dead]]. He constantly drinks in order to "keep the voices out".
* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Papa Midnite]], a former witch-doctor who once fought against Hell. After swearing an oath of neutrality&mdash;unless one side should tip the balance of power&mdash;he opened a nightclub to serve as neutral meeting ground for both sides of the war between Heaven and Hell.
* [[Gavin Rossdale]] as Balthazar, a "half-breed" demon with a special penchant for, and personal history with, John Constantine.
* [[Peter Stormare]] as [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]], a fallen Archangel who is in a proxy war with [[God]] for the souls of all mankind. Lucifer loathes John Constantine with such vigor that his soul is the only one he would ever come to personally collect.
* [[Max Baker]] as Beeman, a friend of John Constantine's with a liking for exotic materials and insects. He serves as both a supplier of holy objects and relayer of information to John.
* Jesse Ramirez as Manuel, a scavenger and treasure hunter who finds the Spear in a church ruin and enters into a trance-like state which resurrects him after getting hit by a car.

==Production==
{{Expand section|Further production details|date=October 2010}}
Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] had developed the film as far back as 1997.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Hindes| url =https://variety.com/1997/film/news/aguilar-moving-to-donner-111662407/|title=Aguilar upped to prod’n exec|work=Variety|date=1997-10-09|accessdate=2014-10-14}}</ref> In 1999, [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]] was attached to direct,<ref>{{cite news|first=Army|last=Archerd|url=https://variety.com/1999/voices/columns/callner-goes-from-tv-specs-to-film-1117503651/|title=Callner goes from TV specs to film|work=Variety|date=1999-07-01|accessdate=2014-10-14}}</ref> followed by [[Tarsem Singh]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Fleming |title=Donners shoot for Winchester|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/donners-shoot-for-winchester-1117799268/|work=Variety|date=2001-05-14|accessdate=2014-10-14}}</ref> Warner Bros. hoped Singh could begin filming in 2002 with [[Nicolas Cage]] attached to star in the lead role<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Fleming|title=DreamWorks logs Logan as Lincoln scribe|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/dreamworks-logs-logan-as-lincoln-scribe-1117856825/|work=Variety|date=2001-12-05|accessdate=2014-10-14}}</ref> but Singh ended up dropping out, a move that inspired dueling lawsuits from Tarsem and Warners.

''Constantine'' was written using some elements from [[Garth Ennis]]’ "[[Dangerous Habits]]" story arc (issues #41–46)<ref name=shock>{{cite web |last=Turek |first=Ryan |title=Update: Francis Lawrence Would Do Constantine 2 |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=3842 |work=ShockTillYouDrop.com |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> and others—such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite—from the ''Original Sins'' trade paperback.<ref>{{cite web |title=Keanu Reeves, Djimon Hounsou and Director Francis Lawrence on 'Constantine' |url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconst072904a.htm |work=About.com |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> However, the film changed several aspects of the source material, including a number of cosmetic changes to the lead character’s appearance: Reeves played the role with his natural accent and hair colour<ref name="Page2">{{cite web |title=Keanu Reeves, Djimon Hounsou and Director Francis Lawrence on 'Constantine' Page 2 |url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconst072904b.htm |work=About.com |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> whilst the original character was intentionally drawn to resemble English musician [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and originally came from [[Liverpool]].<ref name="Vert-Hell" /> The film was also set in Los Angeles; the director pointed out that the comic book was not exclusively set in London either.<ref name="Page2" />

Other differences to the character were made, such as giving him the psychic ability to see "half-breeds" as they truly are.

The film's title was changed from ''Hellblazer'' to ''Constantine'' to avoid confusion with the [[Clive Barker]] ''[[Hellraiser]]'' films.<ref name="Page2" /> The comics series itself was originally to be titled ''Hellraiser'' but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the film, released the previous year.<ref name="Vert-Hell">{{cite book |last=Irvine |first=Alex |author-link=Alexander C.

Director Lawrence decided to base the idea of Hell "on the geography of what's around us now."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.horror.com/php/article-697-1.html |title=Interview with 'Constantine' director Francis Lawrence |work=Horror.com |accessdate=2011-01-31}}</ref> He further explained:
{{quote|That was actually a combination of me and the visual effects supervisor and the production designer sitting down and sort of coming up with the biological growth that’s growing all over the cars and what that looks like and the color palette. And we started to look at the nuclear test films from the 1940s of the nuclear blasts and just decided that it would be great if the landscape was not only violent with these creatures, but also the atmosphere. So we decided that it was kind of an eternal nuclear blast except nothing ever really gets obliterated because it's eternal and it's constantly going.}}

'''''Constantine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' is a 2005 soundtrack album from the film of the same title. The soundtrack is an orchestral compilation of songs in the film, performed by The Hollywood Studio Symphony & The Hollywood Film Chorale and composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], composer for films such as ''[[Eagle Eye]]'' and ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]''.

The songs "[[Passive (song)|Passive]]" by [[A Perfect Circle]] (released in conjunction with the film and heard in the walk through Midnite's bar) and "[[Take Five]]" by [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]] (heard on a record played by Constantine) were not included. The soundtrack was panned by [[Allmusic]], who referred to it as "clichéd and religiously formulaic."<ref name="allmusic"/>

Pete Vonder Haar of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film three stars out of five, stating that "the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/7115 |title=Constantine |last=Vonder Haar |first=Pete |work=[[Film Threat]] |date=2005-02-19 |accessdate=2010-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705151559/http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/7115/ |archivedate=July 5, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

{{quote|If you are a fan of the ''Hellblazer'' comic book series, on which this movie is based, you'll definitely need a distraction. The relation between ''Constantine'' and its source material is, at best, superfluous. The disparity starts with the original John Constantine (Reeves's character) being from Liverpool, England. Reeves from the city of John and Paul? As if.}}

[[Leonard Maltin]]'s annual publication ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide|Movie Guide]]'' gives the film a BOMB rating, describing it as "dreary, to put it mildly".<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Leonard |editor-first=Martin |editorlink=Leonard Maltin |title=Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide.

He was not particularly critical of the film's acting, only mentioning it by stating, "Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking." He added it to his list of "most hated" films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/eberts-most-hated|title=Ebert's Most Hated|first=Roger |last=Ebert |work=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=2005-08-11 |accessdate=2018-03-29}}</ref>

==Home media==
[[Warner Home Video]] announced that the film was to be released on [[HD DVD]] on March 28, 2006.<ref>Business Wire (2006-01-05). [http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/060105/20060105005946.html?.v=1 "Warner Home Video Announces Titles and Release Dates for HD DVD"]. ''[[Yahoo!]]''.

However, following delays to the launch of the HD DVD format (which pushed back the release of many of the initially announced titles), ''Constantine'' eventually made its debut on HD DVD on June 6, 2006. Warner Home Video released a [[Blu-ray Disc]] version of the film on October 14, 2008.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Novelization and video game==
To tie into the film's release, a [[novelization]] by [[John Shirley]] and a [[Constantine (video game)|video game adaption]] of the film was also produced.

The novelization further describes Hell's setting in that the buildings are lined with blood instead of mortar, and built with the souls of the damned rather than brick.<ref name="Novelization">{{cite book |last=Shirley |first=John |author-link=John Shirley |title=Constantine (Mass Market Paperback) |publisher=Pocket Star |date=2005-01-25 |ISBN=0-7434-9755-4}}</ref>

==Sequel==
In a 2011 interview with MTV Splash Page, director Lawrence spoke of a potential [[sequel]]:

{{quote|It's interesting that over the years, ''Constantine'' seems like it's become...like it has this sort of cult following, which has been great. It's been embraced. It would be great to figure out a sequel, and if we did, and we've been trying to figure one out, it would be great to do the really dark, scary version. We got caught in that weird PG-13{{ndash}}R no man's land, and we should do the hard-R scary version, which I would love to do.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rick |last=Marshall |url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2011/05/03/constantine-sequel-francis-lawrence |title='Constantine' Director Hoping To Make 'Hard-R, Scary' Sequel |publisher=SplashPage.MTV.com |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref>}}

In November 2012, it was reported that [[Guillermo del Toro]] and Warner Bros. were considering a film featuring DC Comics' supernatural characters, which includes John Constantine. It is unconfirmed if it will be connected to the 2005 film or if Reeves will reprise his role.<ref>{{cite news |author=Melrose, Kevin |url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2012/11/09/del-toro-confirms-hes-discussing-justice-league-dark-style-movie |title=Del Toro Says He's 'Discussing' Justice League Dark-Style Movie |publisher=ComicBookResources.com |date=November 9, 2012 |accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>
