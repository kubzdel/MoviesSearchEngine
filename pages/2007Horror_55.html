'''''Cthulhu''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] directed by Dan Gildark and co-written by [[Grant Cogswell]] and Daniel Gildark. The film is loosely based on the [[novella]] ''[[The Shadow over Innsmouth]]'' (1936) by [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

The film moves the story from [[New England]] to the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The film is notable among works adapted from Lovecraft's work for having a gay protagonist. Screenwriter [[Grant Cogswell]] explained that he and Gildark chose to exploit the metaphor for the horror faced by a gay person returning for a relative's funeral and having to face the horrors of small-town life.<ref>Annie Wagner, [http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=23128 Oh, the Horror: The Making of 'Cthulhu'], ''The Stranger'', September 15â€“21, 2005. Accessed online 16 June 2007.</ref>

The film premiered June 14, 2007 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] and officially opened in select theatrical venues August 22, 2008.

==Plot==
When young history professor Russ is called upon by his sister to execute their late mother's estate, he is reunited with boyhood friend Mike, and with his father, the charismatic leader of a New Age cult. While exploring his memories, Russ wanders into a warehouse where hundreds of names are listed on the walls. As he sleeps that night, he dreams of a stone [[cudgel]] and awakens to find a cudgel (with the word [[Dagon]] written on it) in his motel room; the town drunk warns him that it is an instrument of sacrifice. A young liquor store clerk enlists him to help find her brother, whom she believes has been taken by the cult. Russ's aunt, who has been living in an asylum, tells him that his mother left a message hidden in her house.

Looking for answers in the warehouse, Russ is taken on an unbelievable journey through the small town's ancient, subterranean origins. When he escapes, he and Mike find the girl's brother murdered. Russ begins to believe preparations are underway for a mass sacrifice, and engages the attentions of a seductress in order to obtain information. He is raped and arrested for murder on the eve of the May Festival. The stakes are raised when Russ discovers that the cult intends to take over the world by raising anthropomorphic creatures from the sea.

Russ is shown his children, presumably gilled [[Deep Ones]] swimming in a bath. The film ends with Russ and his best friend/lover being held by the cult, as Russ' father orders him to choose between the man he loves and the life he has been called to lead in his father's church.
