The film's theatrical release has been delayed since 2011. ''Djinn'' premiered at the [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]] on {{nowrap|October 25}}, 2013.

The film was Hooper's final directorial effort before his death in 2017.

==Premise==
In the near future, a young Emirati couple returns to their home country and moves into a high-rise apartment in [[Ras al-Khaimah]]. They discover that their neighbors may not be human. The film also flashes back to an abandoned fishing village, where the apartment was eventually built. In the area of the village, an American backpacker learns about [[jinn|djinn]] from local Emiratis.<ref name=delayed/>

==Production==
''Djinn'' is directed by [[Tobe Hooper]] based on a screenplay by David Tully. The project was set up by Imagination Abu Dhabi (now [[Image Nation]]) in February 2011. Emirati director [[Nayla Al Khaja]] joined the project as a cultural consultant.<ref name=teams>{{cite journal|last=McNary|first=Dave|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118033012|title=Hooper teams with Imagenation|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> The film is the first supernatural thriller film in both English and Arabic languages. Tully said films about the [[jinn|djinn]] were very uncommon, only recalling ''[[Wishmaster (film)|Wishmaster]]'' (1997). He said ''Djinn'' had minimal gore, similar to Hooper's previous films ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982). Tully came up with the premise for ''Djinn'' when an Emirati friend brought him to a village similar to the one in the film. The screenwriter learned about local stories told in the region.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritman|first=Alex|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/a-visit-to-the-rak-set-of-the-uaes-first-major-horror-movie#full|title=A visit to the RAK set of the UAE's first major horror movie|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=May 3, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>

With a production budget of {{nowrap|US$5 million}},<ref name=hoad/> filming began in the United Arab Emirates in late March 2011 and took place at several locations throughout [[Dubai]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lodderhose|first=Diana|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118034517|title=Laith, Jammal joins 'Djinn'|work=Variety|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> The subject matter was treated with caution so it would not offend local values in the different towns where filming took place. In Al Jazira Al Hamra, the cast and crew avoided using the word "djinn" and also taped over the film's title on the director's chair.<ref name=delayed>{{cite news|last=Ritman|first=Alex|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/release-of-arabic-english-thriller-djinn-delayed-until-summer|title=Release of Arabic-English thriller Djinn delayed until summer|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=January 11, 2012|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> By late August 2011, the film was in post-production.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lodderhose|first=Diana|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118041680|title=Fortissimo pacts with Imagenation|work=Variety|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Release==
In February 2011 [[Fortissimo Films]] acquired the right to represent international sales for Image Nation's films, including ''Djinn''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=Stuart|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/imagenation-abu-dhabi-fortissimo-films-226369|title=Imagenation Abu Dhabi, Fortissimo Films Seal Sales Pact|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 23, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> The film had a test screening in December 2011 in London, which 300 moviegoers attended. It was offered "a red-carpet premiere" at the 2011 [[Dubai International Film Festival]] but was not screened at the festival. The studio promised a theatrical release in early 2012 then in mid-2012; neither release transpired.<ref name=hoad>{{cite news|last=Hoad|first=Phil|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/12/disappearance-djinn-uae-horror-movie|title=The disappearance of Djinn, the United Arab Emirates' first horror film|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref> ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' reported in January 2012 that a website said that Image Nation turned down two distribution offers, but Image Nation denied this and said the film took longer than expected in post-production.<ref name=delayed/> In December 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'' covered the film's delay and cited multiple reasons. The paper reported that unofficial reasons included people related to Abu Dhabi's royal family finding the film "to be politically subversive", horror films being "seen as totally foreign, culturally speaking" in the United Arab Emirates, and local pride that led to "rewrites and restructuring". Image Nation's CEO Michael Garin denied these reasons and blamed the delay on meeting the [[Directors Guild of America]]'s requirements.<ref name=hoad/>

Sales for ''Djinn'' were launched at the [[63rd Berlin International Film Festival]] in February 2013 and continued at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] the following May.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritman|first=Alex|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/uae-made-film-djinn-is-set-to-thrill-audiences|title=UAE-made film Djinn is set to thrill audiences|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|date=April 8, 2013|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}</ref> The film premiered at the [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]] on {{nowrap|October 25}}, 2013.<ref name=weissberg/>

==Critical reception==
Jay Weissberg at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said ''Djinn'' looked "outright bad" for a film by Hooper. The critic wrote, "This limp attempt at local horror takes elements from ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', and others, thrown together into a cheesy, ham-fisted ghost story... Hooper's lack of engagement isn't helped by unimaginative f/x and leaden dialogue." Weissberg did not find the film scary due to its recycling of the elements and thought that characterization was nonexistent. He also said the ''Djinn'' was not redeemed by either its cinematography or editing.<ref name="weissberg">{{cite journal|last=Weissberg|first=Jay|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-djinn-1200776064/|title='Djinn' Review: Tobe Hooper's Execrable Ghost Story|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 29, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}</ref>

Ronan Doyle at ''[[Indiewire]]'' also panned the film, "From its very first frame, expounding exposition over a shoddily-shot desert sequence, this is an unmitigated disaster of a movie, every bit as horrible as the events it attempts to portray." Doyle wrote the film was a disappointment "tonally as well as technically". He found Tully's script to be "insistently uninventive" in reusing common horror elements. Doyle concluded, "''Djinn'' represents, in the end, a fundamental failure to capitalize on the chance for a particularly culturally-rooted new breed of horror film."<ref>{{cite news|last=Doyle|first=Ronan|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/review-why-is-tobe-hoopers-djin-the-first-uae-produced-horror-film-such-a-terrible-movie|title=Review: Why Is Tobe Hooper's 'Djinn,' the First UAE-Produced Horror Film, Such A Terrible Movie?|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}</ref>

Marwa Hamad, reviewing for ''[[Gulf News]]'', wrote that the film's use of djinns was a welcome change from traditional horror narratives. Hamad wrote, "The gimmicky nature of the film is undeniable, relying on the jump-in-your-seat sort of shockers rather than really messing with its viewers’ psyches... But that doesn't mean that ''Djinn'' failed to break ground." Hamad commended the portrayal of the Westernized Arab couple, "The characters' crisis of nationality and lack of belonging underlies the entirety of the plot." She noted, "In that sense, the movie was able to resonate with—and subsequently instill terror into—a certain segment of viewers who usually benefit from feeling a sense of detachment from horror film victims who look and talk nothing like them."<ref>{{cite news|last=Hamad|first=Marwa|url=http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/film/cinema-reviews/film-review-djinn-1.1247268|title=Film review: Djinn|work=[[Gulf News]]|date=October 26, 2013|accessdate=November 13, 2013}}</ref>
