'''''Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes''''' is a 2006 American [[Television film|made-for-television]] sequel and the third installment in the ''[[Pumpkinhead (film)|Pumpkinhead]]'' franchise of horror films. The film is directed by [[Jake West]] (''[[Evil Aliens]]''), who co-wrote the movie with Barbara Werner. It follows 1988's ''Pumpkinhead'' and 1994's ''[[Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings]]''.

== Plot ==
''Pumpkinhead: Ashes to Ashes'' plotline follows more closely to the first film, with townspeople angered over the local mortician stealing and selling the organs of their loved ones and then dumping the corpses in a swamp, rather than [[cremation|cremating]] them. When the townspeople find out, they have the old witch Haggis summon [[Pumpkinhead (character)|Pumpkinhead]] through the mummified body of Ed Harley (played by [[Lance Henriksen]], who reprises his role from the first film). Pumpkinhead then proceeds to go on his killing rampage murdering all those responsible for the desecration, while Doc Frasier (played by ''[[Hellraiser]]'''s [[Doug Bradley]]) hurries to murder those who summoned Pumpkinhead, which will effectively kill the demon in the process.
