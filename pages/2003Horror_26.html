'''''Dracula II: Ascension''''' is a 2003 [[direct-to-video]] [[United States|American]]-[[Romania]]n [[horror film]], directed by [[Patrick Lussier]]. It stars [[Jason Scott Lee]], [[Stephen Billington]] and [[Diane Neal]]. Filmed entirely in Romania by Castel Film Studios, the film is the sequel to ''[[Dracula 2000]]''. It was released [[direct-to-video]] on June 7, 2003. The film marks one of the very few cinematic portrayals of certain aspects of [[vampire]] lore, such as a vampire's compulsive need to count [[mustard seeds]] and untie knots.

The film was followed by a sequel, ''[[Dracula III: Legacy]]'' (2005).

==Plot==
The film focuses on a small group of overzealous scientists who hope to use [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]'s desiccated - but still alive - body to discover the secret of [[immortality]]. Elizabeth Blaine, working at the [[New Orleans]] [[morgue]], receives Dracula's "corpse" from her friend and co-worker Luke following the events of [[Dracula 2000|the first film]]. Elizabeth examines the body and pricks her finger on a fang in what is supposed to be a human mouth. This leads her to alert her boyfriend Lowell, who is suffering from an ultimately fatal degenerative sickness. Lowell claims a wealthy investor wants to fund their research into the mysterious corpse.

On their heels is Father Uffizi, seemingly the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s official vampire hunter. He has been given the task of not only killing Dracula, but granting him [[absolution]] (as the Church realizes that Dracula is in fact [[Judas Iscariot]]), which would allow the vampire to rest in peace. Unbeknownst to the Church, Uffizi has been infected with vampirism after being scratched by a fang during in a previous hunt.  Each day he exposes himself to the sun, burning out the vampiric infection while he screams in pain.

Luke doubts that Dracula is a purely natural phenomenon. He surrounds the now-awake vampire with folkloric wards like mustard seeds and knots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth feels increasingly strange as the infection in her grows, as does her attraction/bond to Dracula. Another member of the team injects himself with Dracula's blood and becomes a vampire, setting out to feed. He kills a woman, making her undead like himself. Uffizi finds and kills them both.

Lowell reveals that there is no "secret investor" and that he used Elizabeth and the others to find a cure for himself. An injection "cures" him, but he survives mere moments before Uffizi arrives. Uffizi tells Elizabeth, now on the verge of becoming a vampire herself, to enter the sunlight and burn away her vampirism. Eric, a member of the team turned by Dracula, attacks the group but is killed with holy water by Luke. Uffizi goes after a now-free Dracula, telling Luke will make a great vampire hunter someday.

Uffizi catches up with Dracula, who taunts him with the knowledge that Elizabeth will simply die and Uffizi knows it. In his weakened state, Dracula is not quite a match physically for Uffizi. The priest manages to get a whip around Dracula's neck and begins the rite of absolution. Dracula then taunts Uffizi with images of Christ's betrayal and [[Crucifixion of Jesus Christ|crucifixion]], and insinuates that he turned Christ into a vampire. Elizabeth, now a vampire, attacks and wounds Uffizi. She leaves with Dracula, who lets Uffizi live because he knows he will follow and eventually find him.

==Reception==
Critical reaction to ''Dracula II: Ascension'' has been mixed to negative. Rebecca Isenberg of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said, "''Dracula II'' is dripping with [[cliché]]d scare tactics, from abandoned houses to bathtubs filled with blood, [and] death scenes are equally predictable."<ref>{{cite web

By the time the eighty-five minutes of movie are over, you'll be pretty tired, too. Nothing happens that is in the least bit frightening. ... [T]he filmmakers splatter the screen with buckets of blood, severed heads, and gory, close-up autopsies, but while all this may be gross and disgusting, it's not scary."<ref>{{cite web

Patrick Naugle of ''DVD Verdict'' said, "In ''Dracula II: Ascension'', co-writer/director Patrick Lussier has crafted an only mediocre sequel that is sub-par in every respect: acting, plot, and special effects. In place of an interesting story is a movie that takes the character of Dracula, binds him to a cross, and keeps him locked up for most of the feature's running time. While the filmmakers' intentions were good, I can't really recommend this sequel to horror fans looking for true cinematic terror."<ref>{{cite web
