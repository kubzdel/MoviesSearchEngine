== Production ==
''General Cemetery'' was conceived in early 2011.<ref name=Cinencuentro />  The screenplay was co-written by Javier Velasquez and Dorian Fernández.<ref name=Cinencuentro>{{cite web|title="Cementerio general": filman película en Iquitos, con Marisol Aguirre, Nikko Ponce y Leslie Shaw|url=http://www.cinencuentro.com/2012/01/13/cementerio-general-filme-pelicula-peru-iquitos-marisol-aguirre-nikko-ponce-leslie-shaw/ |work=Cinencuentro |accessdate=5 February 2012|language=Spanish}}</ref> The story is based in urban legends about the city's main cemetery, which were condensed in the script, and compacted to the investigation of facts.

Airam Galliani was selected to her role, when Fernandez-Moris found her in the Ensamble acting workshop.<ref name=LaRepublica />

Attempting to follow the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] style, Fernández-Moris was influenced by ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', ''[[Cloverfield]]'', ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''.<ref name=Cinencuentro />
