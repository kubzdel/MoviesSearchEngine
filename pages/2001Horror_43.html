'''''Hannibal''''' is a 2001 American [[Psychological horror|psychological]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], [[Film adaptation|adapted]] from the [[Hannibal (Harris novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Thomas Harris]]. It is the sequel to the 1991 [[Academy Award]]–winning film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' in which [[Anthony Hopkins]] returns to his role as the iconic [[serial killer]], [[Hannibal Lecter]]. [[Julianne Moore]] co-stars, in the role first held by [[Jodie Foster]], as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Clarice Starling]].

The film had a difficult and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, ''The Silence of the Lambs'' director [[Jonathan Demme]], screenwriter [[Ted Tally]], and actress [[Jodie Foster]] all declined to be involved in its adaptation.<ref name="tfhrev">{{cite news | first=Dan | last=Jolin | title=Hannibal film review | url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/hannibal | work=Total Film | accessdate=9 March 2007}}</ref> Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], who produced ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]''. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while [[David Mamet]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] wrote the screenplay.

Set ten years after ''The Silence of the Lambs'', ''Hannibal'' follows Starling's attempts to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, [[Mason Verger]], captures him. It is set in Italy and the United States. The novel ''Hannibal'' drew attention for its violence. ''Hannibal'' broke [[box office]] records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001,<ref name="indeptaste">{{cite news|title=Taste of success |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article253462.ece |work=The Independent |location=London |date=20 February 2001 |accessdate=9 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171355/http://comment.independent.co.uk/leading_articles/article253462.ece |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> but was met with a mixed critical reception.<ref name="Meteoritic">{{cite web | title=Hannibal Reviews | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hannibal |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>

==Plot==
Ten years after tracking down serial killer [[Buffalo Bill (character)|Jame Gumb]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Clarice Starling]] is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid. She is later contacted by [[Mason Verger]], the only surviving victim of the serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]]. A wealthy [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]], Verger was paralyzed and brutally disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out.

After learning of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In [[Florence]], one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo [[Pazzi family|Pazzi]] is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.

Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the [[Violent Criminal Apprehension Program|ViCAP database]] of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Blinded by greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and gives it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], ties him up, then disembowels and hangs him. Lecter then heads back to the United States.

Verger bribes [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive.

Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet [[evening gown]], awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's [[prefrontal cortex]], sautés it, and feeds it to him.

After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later seen on a flight with his own boxed lunch, his bandaged arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter shares the brain with the boy, saying, "It's important to try new things."

===Background===
In 1994, a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interviewer asked ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' director [[Jonathan Demme]] about a possible sequel. Demme responded that [[Thomas Harris]], author of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', had been working on the follow-up for "seven or eight years". Demme had an idea even at that time that it would not be a straight follow-up. Harris had told Demme: "I imagine Doctor Lecter going somewhere in Europe... strolling round the streets of [[Florence]] or [[Munich]], gazing in the windows of watchmakers..."<ref>{{cite news | title=Rolling Stone | url =http://storefrontdemme.com/rollingstone.html | accessdate=6 March 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215220221/http://www.storefrontdemme.com/rollingstone.html |archivedate=15 December 2006}}</ref> Demme stated his intention to be involved in the film adaptation of ''Hannibal'' in 1998, less than a year before the novel was published.<ref name="makingdvd">Hannibal DVD "Making of feature"</ref>

[[Dino De Laurentiis]] produced [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' in 1986, based on Harris's 1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', featuring the first appearance of [[Hannibal Lecter]], played by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. De Laurentiis did not like Mann's film: "''Manhunter'' was no good... it was not ''Red Dragon''," he said. De Laurentiis and his wife [[Martha De Laurentiis|Martha]] (also his co-producer) had no direct involvement in ''The Silence of the Lambs'', a decision De Laurentiis came to regret. They did, however, own the rights to the Lecter character and reportedly allowed [[Orion Pictures]], which produced ''The Silence of the Lambs'', to use the character of Lecter for free, not wishing to be "greedy". When ''The Silence of the Lambs'' became a commercial and critical success in 1991, winning five [[Academy Awards]], both Dino and Martha De Laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow-up novel they could adapt. After a lengthy wait, De Laurentiis finally received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the sequel to ''The Silence of the Lambs'' and De Laurentiis purchased the [[Copyright|rights]] for a record $10 million.<ref name="made">{{cite news | first= Jill| last= Bernstein| title=How Hannibal came to be made | date= 9 February 2001| url =http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,435456,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate =6 March 2007}}</ref>

In April 1999, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that the budget for an adaptation of ''Hannibal'' could cost as much as $100 million. It speculated that both [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]] would receive $15 million each to reprise their roles and "$5 million to $19 million for director Jonathan Demme." The newspaper further reported: although ''The Silence of the Lambs'' cost only $22 million, this would not deter the studio from going ahead with ''Hannibal''. Mort Janklow, Harris's [[talent agent|agent]] at the time, told  ''Los Angeles Times'' that Foster, Hopkins, and Demme would soon receive manuscripts of the novel, claiming it would make an unbelievable film.<ref name="imdbnews">{{cite news | title=News articles | publisher=''IMDB'' | url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0212985/news | accessdate =6 March 2007}}</ref>

The novel sold out of its initial 1.6 million [[Edition (book)#Print run|print run]] in the summer of 1999.<ref name="tfscott">{{cite news | title=Interview with Ridley scott | url= | publisher=''Total Film'' | date=March 2001 | accessdate=6 March 2007}}</ref> ''Hannibal'' went on to sell millions of copies following its release.<ref name="cnnscott">{{cite news|title=Bloody 'Hannibal' lacks bite of 'Lambs' |date=8 February 2001 |publisher=''CNN'' |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/08/hannibal.review/index.html |accessdate=6 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225002414/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/08/hannibal.review/index.html |archivedate=25 February 2007 |df= }}</ref>

Demme informed the producers of ''Hannibal'' that he would pass on directing the film.<ref name="makingdvd" /> It has been claimed Demme turned down the project because he found the material "lurid"<ref name="morris">{{cite news | first= Mark| last= Morris| title=Pleased to eat you | date=4 February 2001 |work=The Guardian |location=London | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,433350,00.html | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref> and was averse to the novel's "gore".<ref>{{cite news | first=Gillian | last=Flynn | title=Rebirth of Cruel | date=11 October 2002| url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,357302,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | accessdate =12 June 2007}}</ref> De Laurentiis said of Demme's decision to decline: "When the pope dies, we create a new pope. Good luck to Jonathan Demme. Good-bye."<ref name="made" /> He has since added that Demme felt he could not make a sequel as good as ''The Silence of the Lambs''.<ref name="MovieMogulsde">{{cite book | last=Prigge | first=Steven | year=2004 | title= Movie Moguls Speak: Interview with top film producers | isbn=978-0-7864-1929-6 | publisher=McFarland}}</ref>

===Ridley Scott===
De Laurentiis visited [[Ridley Scott]] on the set of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and suggested to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to.<ref name="MovieMogulsde" /> Scott was in the third week before [[principal photography]] was due to finish on ''Gladiator''.<ref name="makingdvd" /> ''Gladiator'' became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 [[Academy Award]] nominations.<ref name="cnnscott" /> De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of ''Hannibal''. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the [[Hannibal|general and historical figure from Carthage]] who nearly brought down the [[Roman Empire]] back around 200 B.C., so he replied: "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the [[Alps]] next, old boy."<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott read the [[manuscript]] in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a "[[symphony]]", and expressed his desire to do it.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott further explains how he got involved: "I was shooting ''Gladiator'' in [[Malta]] and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of [[Dune (film)|''Dune'']]. This was pre-''[[Blade Runner]]''. Dino had pursued me to direct ''Dune'' and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both ''Blade Runner'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the ''Gladiator'' set. He arrived with a manuscript of ''Hannibal'', about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since ''[[The Godfather]]''. It was so rich in all kind of ways."<ref name="tfscott" />

Although Scott had accepted the job Demme had rejected, he said: "My first question was: 'What about Jonathan?' and they said: 'The original team said it's too violent.' I said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'" Scott did, himself, have some uncertainty with the source material. In particular, he had difficulties with the ending of the novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been in the back of his mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal is what a straight arrow she is." He also "didn't buy the book from the opera scene onwards, which became like a [[vampire]] movie." He asked Harris if he was "married to his ending". Harris said he was not, so Scott changed it.<ref name="tfscott" />

===Script development===
[[Ted Tally]], the screenwriter for ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', was another key member of the original team to decline involvement in ''Hannibal'' (he won an Academy Award for his ''Silence'' adaptation). Tally, like Demme, had problems with the novel's "excesses".<ref name="morris" />

[[Steven Zaillian]] (writer of ''[[Schindler's List]]'') was offered the chance to write the adaptation after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel."<ref name="made" /> [[David Mamet]] was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to [[Ridley Scott]] and the producers, needed major revisions.<ref name="made" /> Stacey Snider, co-chairman of [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available to work on the script day-to-day."<ref name="imdbnews" /> Mamet was preparing to direct his own film.<ref name="made" /> Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: "It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice."<ref name="made" /> A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as "stunningly bad" but found Zaillian's rewrite to be "gripping entertainment".<ref name="staxrev">{{cite news|author="Stax" |title=Script Review: Hannibal |url=http://screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&file=print&pid=116 |work=ScreenwriterUtopia |accessdate=9 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018234328/http://www.screenwritersutopia.com/modules.php?name=Content&file=print&pid=116 |archivedate=18 October 2006 |df= }}</ref>

This question (regarding the script development) was put to Ridley Scott by ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine: "There were lots of rewrites on ''Hannibal''—what was the main problem with the original material?" Scott replied: "That's inaccurate, because there were very few rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed ''Hannibal'' endlessly."<ref name="tfscott" /> Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared that he would not be able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically."<ref name="tfscott" /> Scott has said there were writing and "structural problems" as to what they would do with parts of the film.<ref name="ridcom" /> One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the "love" story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by "assault".<ref name="rollingrevhan">{{cite news | first=Peter | last=Travers | title=Hannibal—Rolling Stone Review | url =https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5948327/review/5948328/hannibal | work=Rolling Stone | accessdate =9 March 2007}}</ref> Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it."<ref name="makingdvd" />

===Casting===
It was unclear if Jodie Foster ([[Clarice Starling]]) and Anthony Hopkins ([[Hannibal Lecter]]) would reprise their respective roles for which they won Academy Awards in ''The Silence of the Lambs'' (best actress/actor).<ref name="imdbnews" /> It became apparent that the producers and the studio could do without one of the original "stars" and would go on to find a replacement. The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: "First and foremost, I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins."<ref name="MovieMogulsde" />

====Involvement of Jodie Foster====
Regarding her involvement in a sequel to ''The Silence of the Lambs'', Foster confirmed to [[Larry King]] in 1997 that she "would definitely be part of it."<ref name="tfscott" /> She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine in 1997 that "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody wants to do it. Every time I see him, it's like: 'When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen?'"<ref name="ki">{{cite news | title=Killer Instinct | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275700,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=17 March 2000 | accessdate=12 June 2007 | first=Daniel | last=Fierman}}</ref> De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a "hunch" she would not be.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.<ref name="doubtlamb">{{cite news | title=Lambs 'in doubt' without Foster | date= 6 January 2000| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/592904.stm |work=BBC  | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref>
This would cause problems for the studio, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and partner MGM.<ref name="made" /><ref name="ki" /> "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production.<ref name="made" /> Misher added that, "It was one of those moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as [[James Bond]] for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?"<ref name="made" /> Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in ''Hannibal'' had "negative attributes" and "betrayed" the original character.<ref name="doubtlamb" />
Foster's spokeswoman said the actress declined because [[Claire Danes]] had become available for Foster's own project, ''Flora Plum''.<ref>{{cite news| title=Foster passes on Lambs sequel | date= 29 December 1999| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/581813.stm |work=BBC  | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref> Salary demands may also have played a part in Foster's non-participation. De Laurentiis said, "I call the agent of Judy [sic] Foster. He say to me 'I have instruction. She no want to read the script if you no give her an offer of $20m and 15% of the gross.' And I say, 'Give my love to Judy [sic] Foster, goodbye.'"<ref name="made" /> ''Entertainment Weekly''  described the project as becoming "a bloody mess, hemorrhaging talent and money" despite Hopkins being on-board.<ref name="ki" />
Foster talked about ''Hannibal'' in an interview with ''[[Total Film]]'' in late 2005. She said: "The official reason I didn't do ''Hannibal'' is I was doing another movie, ''Flora Plum''. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say but there was no way that either of us could really trample on her."<ref>{{cite news | title=The Total Film Interview: Jodie Foster | url =http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-total-film-interview-jodie-foster | work=Total Film | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref>

====Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling====
When it became clear that Foster would skip ''Hannibal'', the [[production team]] considered several different actresses,<ref name="makingdvd" /> including [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Gillian Anderson]], [[Hilary Swank]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Helen Hunt]] and [[Julianne Moore]].<ref name="made" /> Hopkins asked his agent if he had any "power" over casting. He informed De Laurentiis that he knew Moore, with whom he had worked on ''[[Surviving Picasso]]'', and thought her a "terrific actress".<ref name="makingdvd" /> Although Hopkins' agent told him he had no contractual influence on casting, Scott thought it correct to discuss who would be Hopkins' "leading lady".<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott said he was "really surprised to find that [he] had five of the top actresses in Hollywood wanting it."<ref name="tfscott" /> Moore would eventually secure the part. Scott said his decision was swayed in favor of Moore because: "She is a true chameleon. She can be a lunatic in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', a vamp in ''[[An Ideal Husband (1999 film)|An Ideal Husband]]'', a porn star in ''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and a romantic in ''[[The End of the Affair (1999 film)|The End of the Affair]]''."<ref name="tfscott" /> "Julianne Moore, once Jodie decided to pass, was always top of my list," said Scott on his female lead.<ref name="ridcom">Hannibal DVD "Ridley Scott commentary"</ref> Moore talked about stepping into a role made famous by another actress: "The new Clarice would be very different. Of course people are going to compare my interpretation with that of Jodie Foster's... but this film is going to be very different."<ref name="hannibalpe" />

====Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter====

[[File:London Film Museum - Hannibal (5755433470).jpg|thumb|upright|Hannibal Lecter t-shirt worn by Hopkins in ''Hannibal'' on display at the [[London Film Museum]]]]
Hopkins was generally expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 that he would only be interested if the script was "really good".<ref name="imdbnews" /> Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn't make up his mind to commit. "I was kind of surprised by this book, ''Hannibal''. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn't make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about."<ref name="makingdvd" /> When the producers confirmed that they were going to film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: "It needs some condensing."<ref name="makingdvd" /> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [[wikt:Draft|draft]] of the [[Screenplay|script]] by [[Steven Zaillian]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Sir Anthony set for Lambs sequel | date= 21 December 1999| url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/573715.stm |work=BBC  | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref> Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into "Lecter's mind". "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit."<ref name="made" /> In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a [[plastic surgery]] patient.

====Gary Oldman as Mason Verger====
The part of Mason Verger, one of Lecter's two surviving victims, was originally offered to [[Christopher Reeve]] based on his work as a wheelchair-bound police officer in ''[[Above Suspicion (1995 film)|Above Suspicion]]'' (1995). Not having read the novel, Reeve showed initial interest in the role, but ultimately declined upon realizing that Verger was a quadriplegic, facially-disfigured child rapist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Llenden|first=Joseph|date=June 2003|title=You Offered Me ''What''?!

Retrieved 22 July 2012.</ref> The part was later accepted by secondary choice [[Gary Oldman]]. Co-producer Martha De Laurentiis claimed they had a "funny situation" with Oldman wanting a prominent "credit".<ref name="made" /> She said: "Now how can you have a prominent credit with ''Hannibal''? The characters are Hannibal and Clarice Starling. So we really couldn't work something out (at first)."<ref name="made" /> Oldman was apparently "out" of the film for a while, but then came back in, asking to go "unbilled".<ref name="made" /> Oldman would become transformed and "unrecognizable as himself" to play the part of Verger. He would have no lips, cheeks or eyelids. Make-up artist [[Greg Cannom]] said: "It's really disgusting... I've been showing people pictures [of Oldman as Verger], and they all just say 'Oh my God,' and walk away, which makes me very happy."<ref name="made" /> Oldman said that having his name completely removed from the billing and credits allowed him to "do it anonymously" under the heavy make-up.<ref>[http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035937p1.html IGN.com: Interview with Gary Oldman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226192110/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035937p1.html |date=26 February 2009 }}</ref> In home-release versions of the film, Oldman's name is included in the closing credits.

====Further casting====
Other stars subsequently cast included [[Ray Liotta]] as [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] official Paul Krendler (the character had appeared in ''The Silence of the Lambs'', but original actor [[Ron Vawter]] had died in the interim) and Italian actor [[Giancarlo Giannini]] as Detective Rinaldo Pazzi. [[Francesca Neri]] played Pazzi's wife, Allegra. [[Frankie Faison]] reprised his role as orderly Barney Matthews.

===Key production crew===
Scott recruited key production crew whom he had worked with previously. Production designer Norris Spencer had worked on ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'', ''[[Black Rain (American film)|Black Rain]]'' and ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]''. Cinematographer [[John Mathieson (cinematographer)|John Mathieson]], editor [[Pietro Scalia]] and composer [[Hans Zimmer]] had all worked on Scott's previous film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.<ref name="prodnotes">Official Hannibal production notes</ref>

==Production and post-production==

===Background===
''Hannibal'' was filmed in 83 working days over 16 weeks.<ref name="hanj">Official Hannibal Journal</ref> The film began [[Filmmaking|production]] on 8 May 2000 in [[Florence]].<ref name="hanj" /> The film visited key locations in Florence and various locations around the United States.<ref name="prodnotes" /> Martha De Laurentiis said the film has almost a hundred locations and that it was a "constant pain of moving and dressing sets. But the locations were beautiful. Who could complain about being allowed to shoot in [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence? Or President [[James Madison]]'s farm in [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]] or the amazing Biltmore Estate in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]?"<ref name="prodnotes" /> Eighty million dollars and a year and a half in production were spent before Scott got his first look at ''Hannibal'' in the editing room.<ref>{{cite news | first=Charlie | last=Rose | title=60 Minutes: Ridley Scott | url =http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/27/60II/main267597.shtml | work=CBS News| accessdate =7 June 2007| date=27 January 2001}}</ref>

===Filming locations===
*The whole second act of ''Hannibal'' takes place in [[Florence]]. Ridley Scott had never filmed there before, but described it as "quite an experience...It was kind of organized chaos... We were there at the height of tourist season."<ref name="prodnotes" /> Within Florence, the production would visit various [[filming location|locations]] such as the Palazzo Capponi (as Dr. Fell's workplace), the [[Ponte Vecchio]], the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the [[Florence Cathedral|Cathedral]].<ref name="prodnotes" />
*After leaving Italy on 5 June 2000, the production moved to Washington, D.C. Filming took place over six days at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]].<ref name="prodnotes" /> The unusual sight of a [[carousel]] would appear in the transportation hub and shopping plaza at Ridley Scott's request.<ref name="prodnotes" />
*Filming would last for seven weeks in [[Richmond, Virginia]]<ref name="prodnotes" /> for the shootout in a crowded fish market (shot at Richmond Farmer's Market) early in the film. [[Julianne Moore]] underwent [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] training at the Bureau's headquarters before filming.<ref name="prodnotes" />
*A barn in Orange, Virginia, situated on the estate of President [[James Madison]], was used to house 15 "performing hogs".<ref name="prodnotes" /> The 15 Russian boars used in the shoot were from a selection of around 6,000 that the animal wranglers observed.<ref name="prodnotes" />
*[[Biltmore Estate]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], the biggest privately owned estate in the U.S., was chosen to signify the huge personal wealth of [[Mason Verger]].<ref name="makingdvd" />

===Special make-up effects===
[[Make-up artist]] Greg Cannom was pleased to be involved in ''Hannibal'' as it offered him the chance to produce "incredible and original make-ups".<ref name="makingdvd" /> For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the "House of Wax".<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors in an effort to get the look of the character as realistic as possible.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn't lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.<ref name="makingdvd" />

For one of the film's final and infamous scenes, an exact duplicate was created of the character Paul Krendler, played by [[Ray Liotta]], a scene which blended make-up, [[puppet]] work and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] in a way which Scott called "seamless".<ref name="makingdvd" />

===Title sequence===
The main titles were designed by Nick Livesey, a graduate of the [[Royal College of Art]] who worked for one of Scott's production companies in London. The [[Title Sequence|sequence]], shot in [[Florence]] by Livesey himself was intended as the film's second promotional trailer.<ref name="makingdvd" /> The studio thought it not "quite right", but it remained on Scott's mind and would eventually end up as the main [[title sequence]].<ref name="makingdvd" /> Livesey would gather footage of pigeons in an empty square in Florence early one morning which, in the final cut, would [[Morphing|morph]] into the face of Hannibal Lecter.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott believed it a good idea, as it fundamentally asked the question: 'Where is Hannibal Lecter?' Scott explains: "And of course this story tells it, with pigeons in the cobblestones of somewhere, where you wonder where that is...and there he is[...] his face appears."<ref name="makingdvd" /> The titles are said to have been influenced by the film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.<ref name="newtimh">{{cite news | first= Elvis| last= Mitchell| title=FILM REVIEW; Whetting That Large Appetite for Second Helpings | date= 9 February 2001| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04E2D81431F93AA35751C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | accessdate =7 March 2007}}</ref>

===Music===
Ridley Scott worked very closely with composer [[Hans Zimmer]], during [[post-production]] on ''Hannibal''.<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott believes the music to a film is as important as [[dialogue]]—"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact."<ref name="makingdvd" /> Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with [[Film editing|editor]] [[Pietro Scalia]] to discuss scenes in the film and "not music".<ref name="makingdvd" /> Zimmer used a [[symphony]] [[orchestra]] for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a "very odd orchestra...only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range." This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: "Anthony's character is for me somebody at the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow." Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a "modern day orchestra".<ref name="makingdvd" /> The character Mason Verger had his own "theme", which become more "perverted" as the film progressed, according to Zimmer.<ref name="makingdvd" /> [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and [[Patrick Cassidy (composer)|Patrick Cassidy]] for the opera scene in [[Florence]].<ref name="vf">{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = James | title = Virgin Film: Ridley Scott | publisher=Virgin Books | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7535-0731-5 }}</ref> Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score.

==Themes==

===Romance===
Scott has said he believes the underlying emotion of ''Hannibal'' is "affection". "In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time."<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott openly admits to a "romantic thematic" running through the film.<ref name="makingdvd" /> He told [[CNN]] that: "''Hannibal'' was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well."<ref name="cnnscott" /> During the opera scene in [[Florence]], Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s [[sonnet]]s, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" Lecter replies: "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for ''him''?" This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people "missed" the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter in ''The Silence of the Lambs''.<ref name="ridcom" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'', in its [[review]] of the film, said ''Hannibal'', "toys" with the idea of "love that dare not speak its name".<ref name="newtimh" /> Composer [[Hans Zimmer]] believes there to be "many" messages and subtext in each scene of the film.<ref name="makingdvd" /> He said, "I can score this movie truly as a [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]ian archetypal beauty and the beast [[fairy tale]], as a [[horror movie]], as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..."<ref name="makingdvd" /> Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref name="makingdvd" /> During the film's [[post-production]], Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of "anguish", "loneliness" or "disgust".<ref name="makingdvd" /> Scott told the ''[[New York Post]]'' that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is "[[metaphor]]ical".<ref>{{cite news|title=Hannibal News |url=http://www.countingdown.com/movies/1203/news?item |id=5800 |work=Counting Down |accessdate=9 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917122005/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/1203/news?item |archivedate=17 September 2007 |df= }}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine even said in their review, "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'."<ref name="rollingrevhan" />

===Retribution and punishment===
Ridley Scott has said that he believes Lecter, in his own way, to be "pure"—one of the key motivating factors for the character is the search for "retribution and punishment".<ref name="ridcom" />

"There is something very moral about Lecter in this film," said Scott in his audio commentary. "The behaviour of Hannibal is never [[Insanity|insane]]—[I] didn't want to use that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as you or I. He just likes it."<ref name="ridcom" /> Scott did say, however, "In our normal terms, he's truly [[evil]]."<ref name="ridcom" /> Scott also brings up the notion of [[absolution]] in reference to Lecter towards the film's end.<ref name="ridcom" /> Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.<ref name="ideprev1">{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Wilson | title=Lecter's bloody second course has a hollow centre | date= 6 February 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204142404/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/lecters-bloody-second-course-has-a-hollow-centre-690474.html|archivedate=4 February 2009| url =http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/film/reviews/article251440.ece |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate =9 March 2007}}</ref>

===Corruption===
Part of the story involves the character Rinaldo Pazzi ([[Giancarlo Giannini]]), a Florentine policeman who learns "Dr. Fell"'s true identity and realizes that this knowledge could make him rich. His escalating abandonment of morality allows him to countenance and facilitate the death of a [[Romani people|gypsy]] pickpocket, egged on by the desire to have the best for his much younger wife.<ref name="ridcom" /> There is a moment in the film when Pazzi becomes corrupted, despite being what Scott describes as "very thoughtful".<ref name="ridcom" /> Paul Krendler also succumbs to greed and corruption. Starling does not, however, and perseveres to the end, even refusing to release Lecter when she believes he is about to cut off her hand in order to free himself.

==Distribution==

===Promotion===
The first trailer appeared in theaters and was made available via the official website in early May 2000, over nine months before the film's release. As the film had only just begun production, footage was used from ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''. A second trailer, which featured footage from the new film, was released in late November 2000. In marketing the film, Hopkins' portrayal of Hannibal Lecter was chosen as the unique selling point of ''Hannibal''. "Mr Hopkins is the draw here", said [[Elvis Mitchell]] in a 2001 ''[[The New York Times]]'' article.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E2D81431F93AA35751C0A9679C8B63 |title=''Hannibal'' FILM REVIEW; Whetting That Large Appetite for Second Helpings |author=Elvis Mitchell |date=9 February 2001 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> A poster released in the UK to promote ''Hannibal'', featuring Lecter with a "skin mask" covering the right side of his face, was quickly removed from circulation as it was deemed "too shocking and disturbing for the public."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212985/trivia?tr0748077 |title=''Hannibal'' trivia on imdb.com |work=IMDB|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>

===Home media===
''Hannibal'' is available as a one-disc and two-disc DVD. The two-disc DVD contains an array of special features including: [[Audio commentary|commentary]] by director [[Ridley Scott]], deleted and alternate scenes, five production featurettes and a "marketing gallery" which contains trailers, production stills and unused [[Film poster|poster]] concepts.

A special "steel-book" edition of ''Hannibal'' was released in 2007. There are no significant changes made to the DVD itself; only the package artwork was changed.

The film was originally released as part of ''The Hannibal Lecter Collection'' on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in 2009. It has most recently been re-released as a stand-alone release in 2011.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Hannibal'' grossed $58 million (U.S.) in its opening weekend (from 3,230 screens). At the time (February 2001), this was the third-biggest debut ever—only 1997's''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' and 1999's ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]'' grossed more in an opening weekend.<ref name="abc1">{{cite news | title=Box Office: Hannibal Takes Record-Sized Bite | date=11 February 2001| url =http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=109619&page=1 | work=ABC News | accessdate =8 June 2007 }}</ref> As of October 2012, it ranks 90th all time.

But this superior sequel has romance in its dark heart." ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine gave it two out of five stars, calling it "laughable to just plain boring, ''Hannibal'' is toothless to the end." David Thomson, writing in the [[British Film Institute]] magazine ''[[Sight & Sound]]'', praised the film. "It works. It's smart, good-looking, sexy, fun...dirty, naughty and knowing."<ref name="Theriddlerhashisday" /> Thomson does make clear, however, he is a great fan of director Ridley Scott's work.<ref name="Theriddlerhashisday" /> He adds: "It is, literally, that Hannibal Lecter has become such a household joke that he can't be dreadful again. It seems clear that Anthony Hopkins and Scott saw that, and planned accordingly. That's how the movie was saved."<ref name="Theriddlerhashisday" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine in its review said "''Hannibal'' is not as good as ''Lambs''... ultimately more shallow and crass at its heart than its predecessor, ''Hannibal'' is nevertheless tantalizing, engrossing and occasionally startling."<ref name="hannibalvariety">{{cite news | first=Todd | last=McCarthy | title=Hannibal Review | date=5 February 2001 | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117797220.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | work=Variety | accessdate=9 April 2007}}</ref>

A negative review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' claimed that what was wrong with the film was carried over from the book: "The result is an inflated, good-looking bore of a movie.

==Differences from the novel==
According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, the script for ''Hannibal'' was: "quite faithful to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, as well as the considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake)."<ref name="hannibalvariety" /> ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' noted: "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization."<ref>{{cite news|title=Hannibal review |publisher=Time Out Film Guide |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/63664.html |accessdate=16 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228083806/http://www.timeout.com/film/dvd/63664.html |archivedate=28 December 2004 |df= }}</ref> Producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: "I think if you get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital."<ref>{{cite news | first=James | last=Mattram |author2=Al Kehoe | title=Interview: Dino De Laurentiis | year=2001 | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/02/12/dino_de_laurentis_hannibal_120201_interview.shtml | work=BBC | accessdate=7 June 2007}}</ref>

In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, from which he calls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to [[child molestation|molest]] them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her [[sexual orientation]] to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to [[steroid]] abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a [[semen]] sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then [[inheritance|inherit]] the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted [[cattle prod]], and then kills him by ramming his pet [[moray eel]] down his throat.

The book's controversial ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father, which he "brings to life" by [[Hypnosis|hypnotizing]] Starling, allowing her to say goodbye. This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter, culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to [[Argentina]]. At the novel's end, Barney sees them at the [[Teatro Colón]] of [[Buenos Aires]].

Also gone from the film are the flashbacks to Lecter's childhood, in which he sees his younger sister, Mischa, eaten by German deserters in 1944. These flashbacks formed the basis for the 2007 film ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]'' (written concurrently with the [[Hannibal Rising|2006 novel of the same name]]) which portrays Lecter as a young man.

Hopkins was asked in an interview on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I think it would have been a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because I suspected that there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of ''SotL'', she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'."<ref>{{cite news | title=Interview with Anthony Hopkins | url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035935p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=13 March 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917042236/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035935p1.html | archivedate=17 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 2013, there was a news story from Italy where a gangster fed his rival alive to pigs. Many media stories compared this to a similar scene in ''Hannibal''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2013/11/29/mobster-left-to-be-eaten-alive-by-pigs/ | title=Mobster left to be eaten alive by pigs | publisher=NY Post | date=29 November 2013 | accessdate=21 June 2014 | author=Calder, Rich}}</ref>
