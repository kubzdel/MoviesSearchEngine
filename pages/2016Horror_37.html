==Synopsis==
In the tiny town of Babylon, Florida, sixteen-year-old Margaret Larkin (Sara Catherine Bellamy) goes missing, only to be found murdered and thrown in the river, tied to her own bicycle. The town is enveloped by the mystery of a killer in their midst, but the killer himself, Nathan Redfield ([[Josh Stewart]]), estranged son of a prominent town banker, takes the opportunity to pin blame for his crime on an unliked high school principal Walter Perry (Marcus Lyle Brown). Nathan is literally haunted by the ghost of his victim, along with the ghosts of others who have died in the river, while his sadistic father James ([[Christopher Lloyd]]) uses both his son's guilt and his increasing mental instability to control Nathan's every move, with the ultimate goal of driving his son to kill again.
