== Plot ==
The 'Satanic Panic' occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. Parents were stricken with fear that their children would fall into the hands of [[Satan]], and begin his worship. 

In the fall of 2011, a major television network's new series, 'Investigating Urban Legends,' began filming its first episode, set to air in the coming months. A fresh reporter, Taylor Skye (the shows 'Small Town Legends' segment reporter), was sent out on location to Manitou Springs, Colorado. She was to interview local townspeople about the legend behind the town being labeled 'The Devil Worshipping Capital of the Western World.' <ref name="Entertainment Scoop">{{cite web|title=Summer Moore Talks About New Movie|url=http://entscoop.com/summer-moore-talks-about-new-movie/|website=Entertainment Scoop|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> <ref name="Headline Global">{{cite web|title=Summer Moore Talks Warning Movie Satanic Panic Struggles Indie Filmmaking|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/95938/20150527/summer-moore-talks-warning-movie-satanic-panic-struggles-indie-filmmaking.htm|website=Headlines and Global News|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>

Taylor was hired because she grew up near the small town. She hired a couple of her high school friends to help her with her debut on national television. Uncovering stories that lead to the possibility that satanic worship might still be occurring in the small town, lead Taylor to want to go deeper, and risk entering the possible gateway of Satanic worship in the town. <ref name="Oh my Gore" />

Recording each step of their journey on multiple cameras, the threesome documented numerous possible satanic sites and sacrifices. However, on the last night of their discoveries in the wilderness, they uncovered something that was meant to be kept hidden. Every step of their chilling discovery is documented on camera, until the end. An end that has led to them being labeled as 'Missing Person's,' the network canceling the show, and the deceitful cover up by the network that the story ever took place. <ref name="Daily Trojan" />

== Production ==
''The Warning'' was shot in Colorado in 2014.  Writer Summer Moore was inspired after growing up in the area and hearing the local legends of satanic worship taking place.  She set the film in 2011 because the film was to be marketed as really having transpired, thus they did not have the ability to cast well-known named actors. <ref name="The Gazette Telegraph">{{cite web|title=Liberty High School Graduates  New Horror Movie Focuses on Manitou Springs|url=http://gazette.com/liberty-high-school-graduates-new-horror-movie-focuses-on-manitou-springs/article/1547741|website=The Gazette Telegraph|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> <ref name="Daily Trojan" /> <ref name="Headline Global" />
