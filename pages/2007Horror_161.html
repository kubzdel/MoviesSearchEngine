'''''Mười: The Legend of a Portrait''''' is a 2007 horror film starring [[Jo An]], [[Cha Ye-ryun]] and Anh Thu. It became the first horror film in Vietnam, after [[the Fall of Saigon]]<ref>false information on the VN-news, the first vietnamese horror film in South Vietnam ''Con ma nha ho Hua'' (The Ghost of Family Hua). [[Oan hon]] (Spirits) in 2004 from Vietnamese Americans</ref> and also, the first rated film in Vietnam.

==Plot==
Yun-hee, a South Korean writer, is under pressure by her editor to produce something of interest for her next book. She hasn’t had a book published in three years and is all too cognizant of this fact. Things look up when her old friend Seo-yeon calls from Vietnam. Seo-Yeon informs Yun-hee about a local [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] folklore centered around a girl named “Mười” and her haunted [[portrait]]. It just so happens that in Yun-hee’s prior [[novel]], she wrote a [[semi-autobiographical]] tale concerning her friends titled “Secrets & Lies”. In the book Seo-Yeon was portrayed in the most horrible manner, but Yun-hee is sure that Seo-Yeon hasn’t read the book as she has been living in Vietnam for years. Yun-hee eagerly flies to Vietnam to learn more about Muoi.

==Vietnamese reaction==
''[[Muoi]]'' is considered the first horror film [[film|product]]ion to be made in Vietnam.<ref>[http://tintuconline.vietnamnet.vn/vn/vanhoa/134325/ Tin Tuc Online - Vietnamnet<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308171908/http://tintuconline.vietnamnet.vn/vn/vanhoa/134325/ |date=2008-03-08 }}</ref> Despite high public expectation, the picture also received bad reactions.

Upon examination, it received a disapproval from Vietnamese Bureau of Cinema for 
"unsuitable contents,"<ref name="laodong.com.vn">[http://www.laodong.com.vn/Home/vanhoa/sankhauda/2007/8/52690.laodong LAODONG.COM.VN | Dưới 16 tuổi không được xem phim Mười - Duoi 16 tuoi khong duoc xem phim Muoi<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which led to a delay in Vietnamese release. Because of this, it became the second horror film to be released in Vietnam, while another in the genre, ''[[Ngoi nha ma am/Suoi oan hon]]'' (''Haunted House/Ghosted Stream''), came out in August.

Finally, ''Muoi'' was released on December 24, 2007 with the first rating in Vietnamese film history: an under-16 ban for disturbing violence and horror image . Though stuck with this restriction, ''Muoi'' also had to suffer from scene cuts requested by the bureau. These include Muoi's right leg breakage, a [[monk]]'s body falling, and So-hee's death.<ref name="laodong.com.vn"/>

==Awards==
At 2008's 7th [[Golden Kite Awards]] (the local equivalent of the [[Academy Award|Oscars]]), [[Phuoc Sang Films]] chose to send ''Muoi'' to the examining judge; afterwards, controversy arose because it was not considered a "real Vietnamese film"<ref>[http://www.tuoitre.com.vn/Tianyon/Index.aspx?ArticleID=246424&ChannelID=57 : Tuoi Tre Online :<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (most of the film was shot by Koreans). However, the film still received accolades for ''Best Cinematography'' and ''Best Sounds''.<ref>[http://vnexpress.net/Vietnam/Van-hoa/2008/03/3BA000C4/ VnExpress - Phương Thanh giành giải Cánh diều vàng 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075339/http://www.vnexpress.net/Vietnam/Van-hoa/2008/03/3BA000C4/ |date=2008-03-19 }}</ref>
