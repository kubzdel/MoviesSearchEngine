'''''Carrie''''' is a 2002 American [[supernatural]] [[horror film|horror]] [[television film]] based on the novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' by [[Stephen King]]. It is the second film adaptation and a [[Remake|re-imagining]] of the novel. The film was written by [[Bryan Fuller]] and directed by [[David Carson (director)|David Carson]], starring [[Angela Bettis]] in the leading role. In the story, Carrie White, a shy girl who is harassed by her schoolmates, disappears and a series of [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s reveals what has happened to her.

''Carrie'' was produced by [[Pen Densham|Trilogy Entertainment Group]] and [[MGM Television]] at the request of television network [[NBC]]. Filmed in [[Vancouver]], it was commissioned as a stand-alone feature by the network but the studios intended it as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a potential television series. The ending of the novel was changed accordingly, but no follow-up series was ever produced.

The film premiered on NBC on November&nbsp;4, 2002, when it was viewed by 12.21&nbsp;million people. Despite the good ratings and two award nominations (a [[Saturn Award]] and [[American Society of Cinematographers Award|ASC Award]]), the film was poorly received by film critics. The performances, especially Bettis', were praised, but the film was criticized for poor special effects, for lacking a atmosphere of horror and for being overly long.

== Plot ==
Police interview several people, including high school student [[Sue Snell]] and gym teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Desjarden]]. Detective John Mulcahey is investigating the disappearance of high school student [[Carrie White]]. These interviews [[Flashback (narrative)|reveal the preceding events]].

Two weeks before the prom at Ewen High School, Carrie is a shy girl who is tormented by the popular girls, including Christine "Chris" Hargensen and Tina Blake. When Carrie has her [[menarche|first period]] in the shower, the girls taunt her until Ms. Desjarden intervenes and comforts Carrie. Principal Morton decides to send Carrie home but addresses Carrie by the wrong name. An infuriated Carrie yells out, causing Morton's desk to move several inches. Making her way home, Carrie is accosted by a boy on a bicycle, whose joke goes wrong when he inexplicably flies off his bike and crashes into a tree. On arrival at her house, Carrie has a flashback to her own childhood and her special abilities. Carrie's fanatically religious mother, [[Margaret White (Stephen King)|Margaret White]], who considers menstruation a sign of sexual sin, locks Carrie in her "prayer closet" as punishment.

The next day, Ms. Desjarden gives the girls a week's detention for their bullying of Carrie. When the girls skip detention, they face being refused prom tickets. After Chris' father, John Hargensen, a lawyer, unsuccessfully attempts to get her prom ban rescinded, Chris enlists her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, to get revenge on Carrie. Meanwhile, Carrie discovers she has [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], the ability to move or control objects with her mind. After a telekinetic episode in class, Carrie goes home and practices her rediscovered talent. Sue, trying to atone for tormenting Carrie, asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. With some trepidation, Carrie agrees. When Carrie tells her mother about the prom invitation, Margaret forbids her to go. At last, Carrie is provoked into using her powers to confront her mother and Margaret seemingly gives in.

On the day of the prom, Tina switches the Prom Queen ballots so that Carrie and Tommy are declared the Prom King and Queen winners. As Tommy and Carrie take their place onstage, Chris, who has been hiding with Billy in the rafters, pulls a rope to tip a bucket, causing a wave of blood to fall onto Carrie. When Chris and Billy run, Chris having released the rope, the bucket falls on Tommy's head, knocking him out. Carrie goes into a [[Acute stress reaction|shock]]-induced trance and locks everyone inside the gym, killing them all, except for a few students who escape through a vent with Ms. Desjarden. Carrie then leaves the burning school, unleashing a wave of destruction upon the entire town. Chris and Billy find her walking in the road. Billy tries to run her down but Carrie tosses their truck into a pole, killing them.

When Carrie arrives home, she gets into a bathtub, where she finally snaps back to herself but cannot remember what has just happened. Margaret walks into the bathroom and deems her daughter a witch and then attempts to drown Carrie in the tub. With her last ounce of strength, Carrie stops her mother's heart. Sue finds Carrie near death and manages to revive Carrie with [[artificial respiration]]. At Sue's suggestion, Carrie fakes her own death and Sue sneaks Carrie out of town to Florida. As the two drive off, Carrie has a nightmarish vision of her mother. When Carrie wakes, she hallucinates that Chris is lunging at her. Noticing this, Sue asks her if she wants to stop for a moment, but Carrie tells her to keep driving.

Envisaged as a remake of [[Brian De Palma]]'s [[Carrie (1976 film)|1976 film]], Fuller aimed to "give it [...] a little more of an epic feel" rather than the fairy tale-feeling Fuller ascribed to the original.<ref name=fangoria/> He also thought his version could add "a little more depth" with "some scope to the characters and the situation that you didn't have in the original".<ref name=fangoria/> The writer said Bettis' portrayal of the role was meant to give Carrie a "more edgy" characterization instead of the "victim" feeling he believed [[Sissy Spacek]] gave to her in De Palma's film.<ref name=fangoria/> In his words:

{{quote|[Carrie] is not a murderer, and, especially the way Angela portrays her, she is a sympathetic, sweet soul who is a bit more edgy than Sissy Spacek's Carrie. Sissy portrayed her as—I don't want to say pathetic, but just really as a victim.

We wanted to see her blossom and triumph over this instead of losing again.<ref name=fangoria/>}}

Fuller sought to update the film's 1970s setting to a contemporary one, aware that high-school violence, in particular, has changed since then.<ref name=fangoria/> Because Fuller felt the [[Columbine High School massacre]] was still on people's recent memory, he was careful in addressing the film's "teenage vigilante" theme.<ref>{{cit web | url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/hannibal-creator-bryan-fuller-talks-star-trek-dead-like-me-and-adapting-stephen-kings-carrie-for-tv-1201410198/ | title='Hannibal' Creator Talks 'Star Trek' and Balancing Projects | author=Friedlander, Whitney | date=January 23, 2015 | work=Variety | accessdate=January 8, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131140919/https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/hannibal-creator-bryan-fuller-talks-star-trek-dead-like-me-and-adapting-stephen-kings-carrie-for-tv-1201410198/ | archivedate=January 31, 2018 | df= }}</ref>

<!-- AS A TV FILM -->
While Johnson considered the film "a respectable piece of work" owing to an intelligent script that developed all of King's themes,<ref name=ct/> Wertheimer classified it negatively within "the generic made-for-television standard".<ref name=nyt/> Ian Jane of [[DVD Talk]] opined ''Carrie'' was "decent enough" for the limitations of a TV film,<ref name=jane>{{cite web | url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/67388/carrie-the-rage-carrie-2/ | title=Carrie / The Rage: Carrie 2 (Blu-ray) | author=Jane, Ian | date=April 7, 2015 | website=DVD Talk | accessdate=January 9, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110174630/https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/67388/carrie-the-rage-carrie-2/ | archivedate=January 10, 2018 | df= }}</ref> and Arrigo said "the lack of cinematic quality" reflected the television standards of the 2000s.<ref name=dread>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/97031/carrie-the-rage-carrie-2-blu-ray/ | title=Carrie / The Rage: Carrie 2 (Blu-ray) | author=Arrigo, Anthony | date=April 15, 2015 | website=Dread Central | accessdate=January 11, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703102931/http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/97031/carrie-the-rage-carrie-2-blu-ray/ | archivedate=July 3, 2017 | df= }}</ref> Although Wertheimer claimed that the film's drawbacks were not simply caused by the medium, he did make the criticism that the prom scenes were sapped by the commercial breaks: the filmmakers, he argued, should have opted for a shorter sequence.<ref name=nyt/> ''[[SF Gate]]''{{'}}s Edward Guthmann also criticized the film's overall length, especially in regard to the prom scene, as he considered the "dramatic impact" was not enhanced.<ref name=sf/> Phil Gallo of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] '' likewise felt some scenes were extended just to fit the time needed for the next break.<ref name=gallo/> Randy Miller III of DVD Talk said the home media release evidenced "gaps in the action" caused by the commercials.<ref name=miller/>

<!-- OTHER CRITICISM -->
The film's special effects were heavily criticized.{{efn|Gallo considered them to be "a fizzle";<ref name=gallo/> Wertheimer called them "passable",<ref name=nyt/> and Jane declared, "some of the effects work is just plain bad to the point where it can be unintentionally funny".<ref name=jane/> Arrigo said about a specific scene that "the effect is not dissimilar to something an app on my smart phone can produce".<ref name=dread/> }} Fuller himself called the effects "cheap".<ref name=cbr/> Levesque and Gallo found their usage to be excessive,<ref name=spi/> and the former said the film suddenly "shifts into a special effects bonanza".<ref name=gallo/> Another common complaint was that the film was not scary,<ref name=sf/><ref name=nyp/> which lead Levesque to write that "the new 'Carrie' doesn't even fit the category [of scary-movie genre]".<ref name=spi/> Gallo found that it deviated from horror in favor of "prurient side routes", mentioning Sofer's acting, as well as locker-room and post-coital scenes.<ref name=gallo/> Johnson made a similar remark on the sexual content.<ref name=ct/>

<!-- ACTING -->
Most of the praise the film received was directed towards its cast,{{efn|Examples:

}} Linda Stasi of the ''[[New York Post]]'' was one of the those who thought a remake was unnecessary, so she had low expectations for the film. Stasi, however, concluded she had been "completely mistaken"; she was positively surprised by the acting and went so far as to state that Bettis should win an [[Emmy]] for her performance.<ref name=nyp/> Wertheimer remarked that Bettis expressed the character's emotions well, and lamented that the film "affords Ms. Bettis few opportunities for such genuine acting".<ref name=nyt/>

==Aftermath==
The production of the television series was subordinated to the film's audience ratings.<ref name=fangoria/> Although it obtained "strong numbers", according to ''Variety'',<ref name=variety-views/> the series was never produced.<ref name=cbr/> Fuller and Bettis were expected to reprise their roles, and the writer had a concept in mind: he hoped to create a series in which Carrie had to deal with the remorse and the responsibility for killing several people.<ref name=fangoria/> The series would also feature Carrie and Sue on a journey to help other people with telekinetic powers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/top-10-lists/114294/8-horror-movie-tv-series-adaptations-that-didnt-quite-work-out/ | title=8 Horror Movie TV Series Adaptations That Didn't Quite Work Out | author=Squires, John | date=July 21, 2015 | website=Dread Central | accessdate=January 11, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111165130/http://www.dreadcentral.com/top-10-lists/114294/8-horror-movie-tv-series-adaptations-that-didnt-quite-work-out/ | archivedate=January 11, 2018 | df= }}</ref> Fuller wrote the outline for a second episode, but NBC had no interest on it, so MGM ended their deal.<ref name=cbr/> In Fuller's opinion, "the network [n]ever intended to do a series, they were just playing the studio".<ref name=cbr/>

[[Carrie (2013 film)|Another remake]] based on the ''Carrie'' novel and the 1976 film was released in 2013. Directed by [[Kimberly Peirce]] and starring [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], it was created after producers felt the 2002 version did not capture modern bullying.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/10/12/why-remake-carrie/wRo78WImtEcKfUyRQaCmeN/story.html | title=Why remake 'Carrie'? | author=Russo, Tom | date=October 12, 2013 | work=Boston Globe | accessdate=February 15, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224001938/http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/10/12/why-remake-carrie/wRo78WImtEcKfUyRQaCmeN/story.html | archivedate=February 24, 2014 | df= }}</ref> However, film critics like ''The Hollywood Reporter'' found the 2002 version to be more faithful to the original novel.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/carrie-film-review-649237 | title=Carrie: Film Review | date=October 17, 2013 | author=Rooney, David | work=The Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=February 15, 2018 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129042701/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/carrie-film-review-649237 | archivedate=January 29, 2018 | df= }}</ref>
