Bored with nothing to do for their school holidays, Badrol invites his best friend Lim to go on a camping trip at his old [[Kampung]] where he grew up, with intentions to experience some long-forgotten true [[Malaysia]]n life in his Grandfatherâ€™s [[durian]] orchard. However their simple holiday trip is cut short by the discovery of a clue that leads them closer to the rumours of the mystery house deep in the forest. Together with their newly found friends, Raju the animal-whispering boy, Ros the village beauty, and her two cute twin brothers, Upin and Ipin, they work together to unravel the secrets surrounding the small Kampung.<ref>[http://www.sinemamalaysia.com.my/main/index.php?mod=film&p=info&id=445 Sinema Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331112727/http://www.sinemamalaysia.com.my/main/index.php?mod=film&p=info&id=445 |date=2008-03-31 }}</ref>
