'''''Silent Night''''' is a 2012 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Steven C. Miller]] and starring [[Jaime King]], [[Malcolm McDowell]], and [[Ellen Wong]]. It is a loose [[Film remake|remake]] of [[Charles E. Sellier Jr.]]'s 1984 film ''[[Silent Night, Deadly Night]]'' but adds new plot points taken from the real life [[Covina massacre]] that occurred in 2008. It is the sixth installment in the [[Silent Night, Deadly Night (franchise)|''Silent Night, Deadly Night'' franchise]]. The film was given a [[limited release|limited]] theatrical release on November 30, 2012 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 4, 2012.

== Plot ==
A mysterious man dresses in a [[Santa Claus]] suit, complete with a mask. Once dressed, "Santa" captures and kills Jordan ([[Brendan Fehr]]), a police officer in the small town of Cryer, [[Wisconsin]]. Jordan is sleeping with the married Alana Roach and is electrocuted with [[Christmas lights]] in his home. The following day, [[Christmas Eve]], the Sheriff of Cryer, Sheriff Cooper ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), calls Deputy [[Aubrey Bradimore (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Aubrey Bradimore]] ([[Jaime King]]) in on her day off when Jordan doesn't arrive at work. Aubrey is a new addition to the police force, and is still reeling from the unexpected death of her husband John. She doesn't think she's a good officer as she is trying to live up to her father, who is a retired cop. Aubrey was going to spend the holiday with her parents but instead goes out to check on Jordan, finding his mangled body and the hacked up bits of Alana later in the day.

Meanwhile, the masked Santa killer goes on a murder spree, killing those who have done something he considers 'naughty.' His next victim is a bratty teenage girl who he kills with a [[taser]], then he makes his way to the local motel, murdering a group of people during a softcore porn shoot. One woman manages to escape and tries to hide inside a Christmas Tree farm, but the killer chops off one of her legs and throws her feet-first into a [[woodchipper]]. Sheriff Cooper calls in Deputy Giles and goes out to find the killer himself, but comes back empty handed. Aubrey starts to suspect Santa Jim Epstein ([[Donal Logue]]), a local drunken Santa portrayer, Stein Karsson (Mike O’Brian), a local drug dealer and Santa portrayer, and the perverted Reverend Madely (Curtis Moore).

Aubrey attempts to interrogate Karrson, but he flees. Aubrey gives chase, but is nearly killed and only saved by Cooper. That evening, during the town's annual Christmas parade, Aubrey searches for the killer, but is unable to identify him among a crowd of men dressed in Santa Claus suits, though she arrests Jim when he flees from her.  The killer Santa continues on his spree, murdering the corrupt Mayor Revie and his porn star daughter. Reverend Madely is also killed. Aubrey goes to Karrson’s motel room to arrest him, and is forced to kill him when he draws a gun.

Aubrey notices a gift box that contains a piece of coal, and recalls that both the station and her father had received the same gift. Aubrey arrives at her parents’s home, only to find her father dead. Meanwhile, the killer attacks the station, killing Cooper, Giles, and Jim. Aubrey, along with the station secretary Brenda ([[Ellen Wong]]), are cornered by the killer inside the police station, where the killer tries to burn down the place with a homemade [[flamethrower]]. Aubrey is able to overpower the killer Santa and sets him on fire, but in the end he manages to escape. 

It is later revealed that the killer Santa is Ronald Jones Jr., owner of a local chimney cleaning and repair service, and he survived the flamethrower attack. During the hunt for the killer, Aubrey learns from another Santa portrayer that Ronald Sr. had crashed his ex-wife's Christmas party many years ago, burning her alive with the homemade flamethrower. Aubrey's father was the police officer that responded to the situation and gunned him down, only to find out that Ronald Jr. was in his father's truck watching the entire time. The tragedy caused Ronald Jr. to go insane and seek revenge, dressing as Santa so he would not get caught during Cryer's Christmas festivities.

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "The movie's intended audience will likely be satisfied by its parade of gory mayhem, cheap thrills and groan-worthy dark humor. Everyone else: You're on your own" while ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film a "cinematic lump of coal" and a "formulaic effort".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-silent-night-capsule-20121130,0,3813510.story|title = Movie review: ''Silent Night'' drips with Santa's naughty side|author = Gary Goldstein|publisher = Los Angeles Times|date = November 29, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/silent-night-film-review-395453|title = ''Silent Night'': Film Review|author = Frank Scheck|publisher = The Hollywood Times|date = November 29, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 3, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that the film was "a singularly glum and dumb enterprise" and concluded "apart from some modestly inventive carnage and an undeniably humorous hambone turn by Malcolm McDowell, there's really nothing here to make genre fans dash through the snow".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948854/|title = ''Silent Night''|author = Joe Leydon|publisher = Variety|date = December 2, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 10, 2012}}</ref>

''Silent Night'' was met with mostly positive reception from several horror film sites, such as Slasher Studios ("It might not be everyone's cup of egg nog but for what it's worth it is definitely worth a look") and Oh, The Horror! ("it's one of the better recent remakes").<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.slasherstudios.com/2012/12/01/slasher-remake-silent-night-2012-decks-the-halls-with-lots-of-bodies/|title = Movie review: Slasher Remake ''Silent Night'' (2012) Decks the Halls With Lots of Bodies|author = Houston Fisher|publisher = Slasher Studios|date = December 2, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=1297|title = ''Silent Night'' (2012)|author = Brett Gallman|publisher = Oh, the Horror!|date = November 29, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 10, 2012}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave a score of three and a half out of five, writing "While ''Silent Night'' does not add anything new to the subgenre, it delivers the ho ho horror with its spectacular kills and tongue-in-cheek humor. This is a fun film that is bound to spread some holiday cheer in the hearts' of slasher fans" and [[Fearnet]] stated "this straightforward and scrappy little remake is somehow more entertaining than half of what passes for "wide release" horror movies these days. Toss in some fine cinematography, some cool musical touches, and just enough "in jokes" to keep the hardcore horror fans happy, ''Silent Night'' certainly isn't great, but it is consistently fun, and that's more than enough—especially for a horror remake."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3205973/bd-review-silent-night-will-spread-some-holiday-cheer-for-slasher-fans/|title = ''Silent Night'' (2012)|author = Lonmonster|publisher = Bloody Disgusting|date = December 2, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-silent-night|title = FEARnet Movie Review: ''Silent Night''|author = Scott Weinberg|publisher = Fearnet|date = November 30, 2012|work = Silent Night|accessdate = December 10, 2012}}</ref>
