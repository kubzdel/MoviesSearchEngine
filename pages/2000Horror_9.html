==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
Following a major [[recession]], the Japanese government has passed the "BR Act" to control Japan's unruly youth. Middle school student Shuya copes with life after his father commited suicide. Noriko is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by a student.

One year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily "danger zones". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, and a random weapon.

The first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and most caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as his friend secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Although saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist looking for Kayoko Kotohiki, Shuya is wounded.

Shuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, including Yuko Sakaki, who attempts to poison Shuya out of fear for Tatsumichi who she saw die and believes that Shuya had killed him, only for Yuka to accidentally eat the food. Yuko is the only survivor of the ensuing shootout; horrified, she apologizes to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya returns to Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura. Kiriyama kills Mitsuko. Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama kills them. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had been blinded by an explosion rigged by Mimura as he was killed.

On the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and has disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Before he dies, Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun.

Shuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of [[Shibuya Station]]. Noriko gives Shuya a Seto Dragon Claw [[butterfly knife]] before they run off together.

===Casting===
Roughly 6,000 actors auditioned for the film, which was narrowed down to 800 potential cast members. These finalists were subjected to a 6-month period of physical fitness training under supervision of the director, Kinji Fukasaku, who eventually cast 42 out of the 800.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://middle-edge.jp/articles/yC3Lf?page=2|title=『ねえ、友達殺したことある?』の強烈キャッチコピー！20世紀最後の問題作！「バトル・ロワイアル」衝撃シーン10選|newspaper=Middle Edge（ミドルエッジ）|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>

Despite the characters being middle school students, Aki Maeda, Yukihiro Kotani, Takayo Mimura, Yukari Kanasawa were the only four who were aged 15 to 16 years old. The other members of the cast had all graduated from secondary education, and Tarō Yamamoto and Masanobu Ando were the oldest among the actors, aged 25.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freevillage-support.net/%E9%82%A6%E7%94%BB%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%E5%8B%95%E7%94%BB%E7%84%A1%E6%96%99/%E3%83%90%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%83%AD%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A2%E3%83%AB-%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB-%E5%8B%95%E7%94%BB%E7%84%A1%E6%96%99%E6%98%A0%E7%94%BB%E8%A6%96%E8%81%B4-%E3%82%AD%E3%83%A3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88-%E8%97%A4%E5%8E%9F%E7%AB%9C%E4%B9%9F-%E5%89%8D%E7%94%B0%E4%BA%9C%E5%AD%A3-%E5%B1%B1%E6%9C%AC%E5%A4%AA%E9%83%8E-%E5%AE%89%E8%97%A4%E6%94%BF%E4%BF%A1-%E3%83%93%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%81%9F%E3%81%91%E3%81%97/|title=バトルロアイアル[映画]動画無料映画視聴（キャスト:藤原竜也、前田亜季、山本太郎、安藤政信、ビートたけし）|website=Freevillage-support.net|language=ja-JP|access-date=2017-02-17}}</ref>

===Creative process===
[[Kinji Fukasaku]] stated that he decided to direct the film because the novel it was adapted from reminded him of his time as a 15-year-old [[munitions]] factory worker during [[World War II]]. At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses. At that point, Fukasaku realised that the Japanese government was lying about World War II, and he developed a burning hatred of adults in general that he maintained for a long time afterwards.<ref name="BRBritishInterview">{{cite web |url=http://www.battleroyalethemovie.com/staff.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20021205020037/http://www.battleroyalethemovie.com/staff.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-12-05|title= Director's statement at the Internet Archive|accessdate=2006-12-30 }}</ref>

[[Beat Takeshi]] told a documentary crew during filming that he believes "an actor's job is to satisfy the director... I move the way I'm told to. I try to look the way I'm told to. I don't know much about the emotional side", before adding, "Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but he told me to play myself, as I ordinarily would be! I'm just trying to do what he tells me."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGuKqIMN160 |title=The Making of Battle Royale (English subs) Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-04-09 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>

When asked in an interview with ''The Midnight Eye'' if the film is "a warning or advice to the young", Kinji Fukasaku responded by describing the words "warning" and "advice" as "sounding very strong to me" as if they were actions which one tries to accomplish; therefore the film would not be "particularly a warning or advice." Fukasaku explained that the film, which he describes as "a [[fable]]", includes themes, such as crime by young people, which in Japan "are very much real modern issues." Fukasaku said that he did not have a lack of concern or a lack of interest; he used the themes as part of his fable. When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word "run" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as "very positive", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having "a stronger meaning" than "a simple message." He further explained that the film simply contains his "words to the next generation", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name="BRBritishInterview"/><ref name="Midnighteyeint">"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>

===Music===
The [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions. The choral movement used in the film's overture and original trailer is the "Dies Irae" from [[Giuseppe Verdi]]’s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]''.

The song used during the end credits, "[[Shizuka na Hibi no Kaidan o]]" by the [[rap rock]] band [[Dragon Ash]], is not included in either the Japanese or French edition of the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.battleroyalefilm.net/merchandise/music.html |title=battleroyalefilm.com |publisher=battleroyalefilm.com |date=2003-07-16 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref>

===Controversies===
Fukasaku originally opposed the R15 rating given by the ''Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai'' ([[Eirin]]) because of Fukasaku's experiences as a teenager, the novel's use of 15-year-olds, and the fact that many of the actors were around fifteen years of age. After he submitted an appeal and before ''Eiga Rinri Kanri Iinkai'' could rule on the appeal, members of the [[National Diet]] said that the film harmed teenagers; the Diet members also criticised the film industry ratings, which were a part of self-regulation by the Japanese film industry. Fukasaku dropped the appeal to appease the Japanese Diet in hopes they would not pursue increasing film regulation further.<ref name="BRBritishInterview"/><ref name="Midnighteyeint"/>

The film was labeled "crude and tasteless" by members of [[National Diet]] and other government officials after the film was screened for them before its general release.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mediacircus.net/battleroyale.html|title= Battle Royale Movie Review|accessdate=2007-01-08 |last= Leong|first= Anthony|year= 2001|work= |publisher= Issue 33 of Asian Cult Cinima|pages= |language= |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070212005210/http://mediacircus.net/battleroyale.html| archivedate=February 12, 2007<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The film created a debate over government action on media violence.

For eleven years, the film was never officially released in the [[United States]] or [[Canada]], except for screenings at various [[film festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The film was screened to a test audience in the U.S. during the early 2000s, not long after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], resulting in a negative reaction to the film's content.<ref name="crunchyroll"/> According to the book ''Japanese Horror Cinema'', "Conscious of the Columbine syndrome, which also influenced the reception of ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999), much of the test audience for ''Battle Royale'' condemned the film for its 'mindless' and gratuitous violence in terms very reminiscent of the British attitude towards [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971) on its initial release."<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Tony|title=Japanese Horror Cinema|year=2006|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0748619941|pages=130–143 [130]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yo4cY5Rcd4MC&pg=PA130|edition=Reprint.|editor=Jay McRoy|accessdate=27 March 2012|chapter=10.

===Special edition===
A special edition of the film was released after the original which has eight extra minutes of running time. Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):
* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.
* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma's [[mental illness]] or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.
* Three epilogues (referred to as "requiems"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.
* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.
* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.
* Extra CGI throughout the film.

===3D theatrical re-release===

===Critical reception===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 87% based on reviews from 45 critics, and an [[average rating]] of 7.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Battle Royale'' is a controversial and violent parable of adolescence, heightening teenage melodrama with life-or-death stakes."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battle_royale/| title=Battle Royale | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=23 February 2018 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127040652/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/battle_royale/ |archivedate=27 November 2017}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100 based on seven critics, indicating "universal acclaim."<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle Royale|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/battle-royale-2000|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref> Robert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented, "Given the most basic characters to work with, the mostly teen cast attacks the material with frightening gusto, and Fujiwara dutifully invokes the voice of inner moral conflict. Production is exceedingly handsome and vigorous, offering no sign that Fukasaku is slowing down." He stated that, "returning to his roots as Japan's maestro of mayhem, Kinji Fukasaku has delivered" one of "his most outrageous and timely films", comparing it to "the outrage over youth violence" that [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' "generated in early-'70s Britain" and featuring some of "the most startling scenes of mayhem since the movies of the wild and bloody '70s."<ref name="variety_br">{{cite news|last=Koehler|first=Robert|title=Battle Royale|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117797143/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=January 22, 2001}}</ref> Jason Korsner of [[BBC News]] gave ''Battle Royale'' four out of five stars, stating that it is "a heart-stopping action film, teaching us the worthy lessons of discipline, teamwork, and determination, but wrapping them up in a deliberately provocative, shockingly violent package."

He compared it to ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' in how it makes audiences "wonder what they would do in the same situation", but wrote that ''Battle Royale'' gives "even harder choices for its school-uniformed characters." He concluded that, "Some will be uncomfortable or appalled, and the mix of humour and [[Horror film|horror]] is uneasy, but this isn't a film you'll forget easily. And, seriously, what would you do?"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Newman|title=Battle Royale|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=118580|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=December 30, 2006}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' critic [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film four stars in September 2001, choosing it as the best film of the week. He praised [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s performance as the teacher and some of the scenes as "a stunningly proficient piece of action film-making, plunging us into a world of delirium and fear." He notes that, among "the hail of bullets and the queasy gouts of blood, troubling narratives of yearning and sadness are played out. It is as if the violence of ''Battle Royale'' is not a [[satire]] of society at all, but simply a metaphor for the anguish of adolescent existence." He concluded that, while some "will find the explicit violence of this movie repulsive", it "is a film put together with remarkable confidence and flair. Its steely candour, and weird, passionate urgency make it compelling."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|title=A time to kill – Ironically, this week's best film deals with violence – and how the state reacts to it.

There has been renewed interest in the film following its 2012 Blu-ray release in the United States.

Film critics Robert Davis and Riccardo de los Rios praise the film's narrative structure. They comment that in adapting a story such as Battle Royale which requires a suspension of disbelief to go along with its “far-fetched” story Fukasaku instead turns conventional rules of screenwriting on its head. Instead of focusing on the detail of the premise of a near future where school kids kill one another “the filmmakers dispense with premise in a short series of title cards”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Davis|last2=de los Rios|first2=Riccardo|year=2006|title=From Hollywood to Tokyo: Resolving a Tension in Contemporary Narrative Cinema|jstor=44019218|journal=Film Criticism|volume=31|pages=157–172|via=}}</ref>

===Social and political interpretations===
Critics have often expressed the opinion that the film is a [[social commentary]] that is reflecting the issues of Japanese society towards the end of the [[20th century]]. Some viewers see Battle Royale as a [[satire]] of the [[Japanese economy]] during the [[Lost Decade (Japan)|Lost Decade]]. Others view it as a criticism of the [[Education in Japan|Japanese educational system]], such as the issues of [[school violence]] and its failings to prepare students for the extremely competitive Japanese employment market that favors [[elitism]], in which students must partake in fiercely competitive nationwide examinations in order to secure a spot into the more distinguished universities, as these will guarantee student placement into better careers. Other interpretations include the Japanese [[Generation gap|generational attitudes]] that are creating social, political and economic divides between the young and old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediacircus.net/battleroyale.html |title=Battle Royale Movie Review by Anthony Leong from |publisher=MediaCircus.net |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> Fukasaku himself has stated: "The children who have grown up and witnessed what happened to the adults, their anxiety became heightened as well. So I set Battle Royale within this context of children versus adults."<ref name="Midnighteyeint" />

In 2009, [[Quentin Tarantino]] listed ''Battle Royale'' as his favorite film released since he began directing in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/08/20/quentin-tarantinos-favorite-20-films-since-1992/|title= Quentin Tarantino’s Favorite 20 Films Since 1992|accessdate=2009-09-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091028031606/http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/08/20/quentin-tarantinos-favorite-20-films-since-1992/| archivedate=October 28, 2009<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> That same year, [[Moviefone]] included it in the top five of its "50 Best Movies of the Decade" list.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barnes|first=Jessica|title=Now It's the 50 Best Movies of the Decade!|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2009/09/25/now-its-the-50-best-movies-of-the-decade/|work=Cinematical|publisher=[[Moviefone]]|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=September 25, 2009}}</ref> Jon Condit of [[CraveOnline|Dread Central]] called it "one of the best movies [he's] ever seen."<ref>{{cite web|last=Condit|first=Jon|title=Battle Royale (2000)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/battle-royale-2000|work=Dread Central|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|accessdate=27 March 2012|date=June 28, 2005}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film fifteenth in its list of the "Top-20 Horror Film of the Decade", with the article calling the film "a go-for-broke extravaganza: fun, provocative, [[Movie violence|ultra-violent]], and bound to arouse controversy (which it did)...the film [is] more than just an empty provocation – it builds character through action, a method all good filmmakers should seek to emulate."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18415|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 2|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091219195634/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18415| archivedate=December 19, 2009<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2010, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' ranked ''Battle Royale'' #235 and #82 on their lists of "[[List of films considered the best|The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time]]" and "The 100 Best Films of World Cinema" respectively.<ref>{{cite web | title = Empire Features | url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/51.asp | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |author1=Simon Braund |author2=Glen Ferris |author3=Ian Freer |author4=Nev Pierce |author5=Chris Hewitt |author6=Dan Jolin |author7=Ian Nathan |author8=Kim Newman |author9=Helen O'Hara |author10=Olly Richards |author11=Owen Willams | date = 2010-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema – 82.

Maggie Lee of [[Reuters]] describes ''Battle Royale'' as the "film that pioneered the concept of the teen death game", citing its influence on films such as ''[[Kaiji (manga)|Kaiji]]'' (2009) and [[Hideo Nakata]]'s ''[[The Incite Mill]]'' (2010), both of which starred [[Tatsuya Fujiwara]] (who played ''Battle Royale'''s protagonist [[Shuya Nanahara]]) in the leading roles.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Maggie|title=Japanese massacre thriller looks better in 3D|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/02/15/film-us-film-battle-idUKTRE71E0O320110215|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=4 April 2012|date=February 15, 2011}}</ref> V.A.

====Video games====
The genre  of [[Battle royale game|battle royale video games]], in which players compete to be the last one standing in a shrinking battlefield, took its name from the film. It became popular in the mid-2010s and includes games such as ''[[ARMA 3]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|Day Z]]'', ''[[H1Z1: King of the Kill]]'', ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds|PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)]]'' and ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]''.

===Sequel===
{{main|Battle Royale II: Requiem}}
[[Kinji Fukasaku]], who directed the first film, began work on a [[sequel]], entitled ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem|Requiem]]'', but died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with [[Takeshi Kitano]]. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku|Kenta]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, directed the rest of the film, which was released on May 18, 2003.

Unlike the first film, the sequel is not adapted from a novel, but was based on an original screenplay written by Kenta Fukasaku. The plot revolves around the survivor [[Shuya Nanahara]] leading a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] rebellion, but was controversial for its provocative [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] sentiments and criticised for being inferior to the original.<ref>{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Jamie|title=Battle Royale II: Requiem (2004)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/05/18/battle_royale_ii_2004_review.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 March 2012|date=18 May 2004}}</ref>

===Remake plans===
In June 2006, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[New Line Cinema]], with producers Neil Moritz and [[Roy Lee]], intended to produce a new [[Film remake|adaptation]] of ''Battle Royale''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=McNary |title=New Line set to do 'Battle' |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117944872.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Business Information |date=2006-06-07 |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref> Several Web sites echoed the news, including [[Ain't It Cool News]], which claimed the remake would be "an extremely [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|Hard R]] – serious-minded Americanisation of BATTLE ROYALE."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=23540 |title=BATTLE ROYALE American Remake Set Up... |accessdate=2008-01-14 |author=Harry Knowles |date=2006-06-08 |work=Ain't It Cool News |publisher=Ain't It Cool, Inc.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212001048/http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=23540| archivedate=February 12, 2008<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> New Line tentatively set a release date of 2008.

The next month, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on an Internet [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against the remake. Through the article, Lee assured fans of his respect for the original work, claiming, "This is the one I'm going to be the most careful with." He stated that, despite earlier concerns, the film would not be toned down to [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG or PG-13]], the characters would remain young teenagers, and that it would draw elements equally from [[Battle Royale (novel)|the novel]], the original film, and the manga. The reporter noted "the hubbub...was at least slightly premature [as] New Line hasn't yet purchased the remake rights."<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Ito |title=Lesson Plan: Kill or Be Killed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/movies/09ito.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2006-07-09 |accessdate=2008-01-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428110717/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/movies/09ito.html |archivedate=April 28, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Following the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] in April 2007, Lee claimed that prospects for the remake had been "seriously shaken". While he remained willing to proceed, he stated, "we might be a little more sensitive to some of the issues." The reporting article noted that New Line still had not secured remake rights – its spokeswoman claimed "no news" when asked about progress on any deal.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Cieply |title=After Virginia Tech, Testing Limits of Movie Violence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/business/media/30hostel.html |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2008-01-14 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150605121509/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/30/business/media/30hostel.html| archivedate=June 5, 2015<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

''[[Maclean's]]'' pointed out that the 2008 novel ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', and its subsequent [[The Hunger Games (film)|2012 film adaptation]], have similar themes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bethune |first=Brian |url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/04/02/dystopia-now/ |title=‘The Hunger Games’: your kids are angrier than you think – Film |publisher=Macleans.ca |date=2012-04-02 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}</ref> Although ''Hunger Games'' author Suzanne Collins maintains that she "had never heard of that book until [her] book was turned in", ''[[The New York Times]]'' reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" and that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10collins-t.html?pagewanted=all|title=Suzanne Collins’s War Stories for Kids|date=April 8, 2011|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=November 14, 2011|first=Susan|last=Dominus}}</ref> The 2012 film adaptation has also faced similar criticisms for similarities to ''Battle Royale''.<ref name="moviecitynews_thg">{{cite web|last=Poland|first=David|title=Review: The Hunger Games|url=http://moviecitynews.com/2012/03/review-the-hunger-games/|publisher=Movie City News|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=March 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="wsj_thg"/>

In March 2012, Roy Lee reported that a remake of ''Battle Royale'' would no longer be possible due to the release of ''The Hunger Games'', stating, "Audiences would see it as just a copy of ''Games'' – most of them wouldn't know that ‘''Battle Royale''’ came first. It's unfair, but that's reality." However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to "develop a ‘''Battle Royale'' movie for the next generation."<ref name="wsj_thg">{{cite news|last=Yang|first=Jeff|title=‘Hunger Games’ Vs. ‘Battle Royale’|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/03/23/the-hunger-games-vs-battle-royale/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=24 March 2012|date=March 23, 2012}}</ref>

===American TV series===
During the summer of 2012, [[The CW Television Network]] had been in discussion with the Hollywood representatives about the possibility of turning ''Battle Royale'' into an American television show. According to a spokesperson, the talks were only preliminary, but if a deal could be reached, the network would acquire rights to Koushun Takami's underlying novel, then unpack and expand on it for an hour-long dramatic series. Joyce Jun, a Hollywood attorney representing U.S. rights to the title, states that "there is no deal in place". A CW spokesman confirmed only there had been some discussion but declined to comment further.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-battle-royale-could-be-reborn-as-a-tv-show-20120726,0,5414971.story?track=rss | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Steven | last=Zeitchik | title='Battle Royale' could be reborn as a TV show | date=2012-07-26}}</ref>
