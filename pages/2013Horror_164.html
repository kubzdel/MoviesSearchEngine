Certain scenes evoke comparisons with the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] which took place during post-production.

Yes, I do.”<ref name=mis>[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/03/26/whatever-happened-to-the-o-c-star-mischa-barton.html Whatever Happened to ‘The O.C.’ Star Mischa Barton? ] Daily Beast. 26 March 2013</ref>

==Reception==
The film was reviewed positively by the horror-genre specialist website, ''Shock Till You Drop''. Tyler Doupe praised the cast's performances; ″Sawa turned in a good performance, as Travis. And Mischa Barton successfully broke the mold of the roles we’ve seen her play time and again. The late Michael Clark Duncan was excellent as the high school principal.″ Doupe also praised the resourceful use of the low budget, noting that ″The film feels like a movie that was made for a lot more money than what was actually spent...It takes true creativity to stretch a micro budget into anything more than that, and Matt Orlando stretched his budget very effectively.″ Doupe also commented that ″A Resurrection did a good job of leaving certain aspects of the film up to the viewer to figure out. We are not [[Spoon-feed|spoon fed]] every detail and audiences appreciate that. We respect filmmakers that trust their viewers to put the pieces together themselves.″ He continued; ″the premise is primarily unique. I like the way that Matt Orlando's script mixed reality with aspects of occult spirituality and kept the viewer wondering how the two were ultimately going to work together.″<ref>[http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/reviews/172937-review-a-resurrection Review: A Resurrection] Shock Till You Drop. 17 March 2013</ref>

Issues surrounding the production of this film would ultimately make a major impact in an unexpected area—[[college basketball]]. [[Pittsburgh]]-based financial adviser Marty Blazer used money from some of his clients, which included professional athletes, to help finance the film. The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] alleged that he had defrauded five clients out of $2.35 million in order to fund this film and other entertainment projects. Facing federal criminal charges stemming from this episode, he became an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] informant in a major investigation of corruption in college basketball. The first wave of indictments stemming from this investigation were announced in fall 2017, and by March 2018 more than 35 [[NCAA Division I]] men's programs were potentially implicated in NCAA rules violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/22748218/how-one-man-hollywood-flop-set-ncaa-basketball-biggest-scandal |title=How one man's Hollywood flop set off NCAA basketball's biggest scandal |first=Paula |last=Lavigne |website=[[ESPN.com]] |date=March 14, 2018 |accessdate=March 16, 2018}}</ref>
