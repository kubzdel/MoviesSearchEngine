{{Expand section|date=May 2017}}

In October 1962, during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], a Soviet submarine delivers barrels of nuclear material to Cuba, and has to outrun an American submarine. When one of the crewmen suggests that the submarine should slow down and identify itself, the captain shoots him. The submarine is shot and damaged, drowning the crew and releasing radioactive material into its nearby waters. It causes an octopus to grow into a monstrous size, attacking submarines and naval vehicles off Cuba's coasts.

In the year 2000, in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria, two CIA officials, Roy and Henry, discuss about files, before they go out for a walk. Meanwhile, someone disguised as an old woman gives a bag to an official's daughter, but the bomb inside the bag detonates, killing everyone inside the American embassy and injuring many people nearby. The two officials pursue the old woman, but the old woman's henchmen crash a car at Henry, injuring and killing him. Afterwards, Roy pursues the old woman and captures her, and she is revealed to be the leader of a terrorist group.

The terrorist is captured and taken into a submarine, but his henchmen hijack the vehicle and threaten the crew to release him. However, the submarine is attacked by a giant octopus.
