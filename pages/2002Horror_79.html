==Plot==
Graham Hess ([[Mel Gibson]]), a former reverend, lives with his [[asthma]]tic son Morgan ([[Rory Culkin]]), his daughter Bo ([[Abigail Breslin]]) who leaves glasses of water around the house for various reasons, and his younger brother Merrill ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), a failed minor league baseball player, on an isolated farm in [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania]]. Hess has lost his faith and gave up his priesthood after his wife, Colleen, died in a traffic accident caused by a town local, Ray Reddy ([[Shyamalan]]).

One morning, Graham discovers a [[crop circle]] in his field. While investigating the crop circle with the local law enforcement, Graham learns of animals becoming violent across town. Morgan is forced to kill one of the family dogs when it turns violent against Bo. They hear reports of crop circles appearing around the globe, and there are reports of lights from invisible objects over Mexico. Later, Graham and Merrill find the farm is being watched by a tall dark figure which disappears into the fields when they give chase. The next day, they hear strange noises over a baby monitor, but cannot find their source. Graham approaches the crop circle but on seeing a green leg sticking out of the cornrows, flees back to the house.

After opening up to Merrill about the death of his wife, noting that her last words were "tell Merrill to swing away", Graham goes to visit Ray, the first time since the incident. When Graham is gone, Merrill and the children watch a news report about footage taken of an alien creature in Brazil, showing that the aliens can blend into their surroundings. Merrill joins the children in wearing [[tin foil hat]]s, believing that the aliens can read their minds. At Ray's, Graham finds Ray is bleeding from an injury but otherwise apologetic for the accident. After Graham accepts his apology, Ray departs for a nearby lake, saying "they" do not like water. Graham finds Ray has trapped one of the aliens in his pantry, and tries to see what the alien looks like using a kitchen knife under the door; the alien grabs at him, and Graham reacts by cutting off its fingers before fleeing. On his return, and hearing news that more lights have been seen in the skies across the globe, the Hess family decides to stay at their house instead of leaving for the lake, barricading the doors and windows.

After an emotionally charged dinner, they hear the same noises on the baby monitor before their television signal drops out, and place the final barricades and defenses before they gather together. As the aliens attempt to gain entry into the house, the family discovers they have left the attic door unguarded and quickly retreat to the basement. The aliens assault the basement door and in the subsequent chaos the light goes out as Graham and Merrill prevent their entry. However, Morgan suffers an asthma attack when the aliens attempt to enter by way of an old coal chute. By morning, reports on the radio reveal that the aliens have left Earth as suddenly as they arrived. Graham leaves the basement to locate Morgan's asthma inhaler, the others following him. But they discover an alien, the one trapped in Ray's home, is still there, and takes Morgan hostage. Colleen's last words come back to Graham, and he instructs Merrill to "swing away" with a baseball bat from his minor league days. Merrill attacks the alien but not before it attempts to poison Morgan by spraying him with a toxin from its body. Graham recovers his son when the alien drops him and takes Morgan outside with his medication. Merrill continues to attack the alien, causing it to fall onto the ground, knocking over one of the glasses of water Bo had left and splashing it with water. The water reacts like acid on its skin, making it scream in agony. Merrill, seeing their weakness to water begins knocking it into furniture, intentionally where Bo left water, and it is doused with water full on its face, and dies. Outside, Graham administers Morgan's medicine and waits for his son to wake up, hoping that due to his lungs being closed from his previous asthma attack he was spared. Then, Morgan wakes up and the family rejoices. 

Some time later, the Hess family has recovered from the incident and they appear to be doing much better than before. In the final scene, Graham is shown returning to his priestly duties, apparently having regained his faith.

===Critical reception for soundtrack===

The soundtrack generally received positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] stated in his review that: <blockquote>With ''Signs'', composer James Newton Howard again joins director M. Night Shyamalan for their third collaboration following ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'', and clearly the film presents another thrilling encounter with the supernatural. From his opening "Main Theme," Howard ratchets up the tension, and his music thereafter alternates only between the ominous and the suspenseful. He overloads his lower tones, employing eight basses, five percussionists, and even a tuba, but also uses a large string section for short, fast, repetitive figures meant to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. This is not particularly imaginative music, just good old Saturday afternoon scary movie fare, the only distinguishing characteristic about it -- consistent with Shyamalan's style -- that it is so relentless. There's just no let up; dread pervades every moment of the director's films, to the point of emotional exhaustion for some, and the score has to have the same uncompromising approach, which can make it a little hard to take when listened to all the way through.</blockquote>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars, writing "M. Night Shyamalan's ''Signs'' is the work of a born filmmaker, able to summon apprehension out of thin air. When it is over, we think not how little has been decided, but how much has been experienced ... At the end of the film, I had to smile, recognizing how Shyamalan has essentially ditched a payoff. He knows, as we all sense, that payoffs have grown boring."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020802/REVIEWS/208020305/1023 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=Signs :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |accessdate=2011-02-21 |date=2002-08-02}}</ref> [[Nell Minow]] of [[Common Sense Media]] gave the film four out of five stars; she highly praised the casting and Shyamalan's direction, saying his "only flaw was not leaving anything to the audience's imagination".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/signs?hash=1340488598#csm-user-review-display |title=Signs - Movie Review |publisher=Commonsensemedia.org |date=2003-05-18 |accessdate=2012-11-15}}</ref>

Mike LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film one star out of four, thinking that the film had "few thoughts and no thrills."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Signs-of-distress-Shyamalan-s-puzzling-plot-2788009.php | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title='Signs' of distress / Shyamalan's puzzling plot circles go flat quickly | first=Mick | last=Lasalle | date=2002-08-02}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Todd McCarthy criticised the film for its lack of originality, writing "After the overwrought ''[[Unbreakable (film)|Unbreakable]]'' and now the meager ''Signs'', it's fair to speculate whether Shyamalan's persistence in replicating the otherworldly formula of ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' might not be a futile and self-defeating exercise."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/signs-2-1200547091/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |title=Signs Movie Review |first=Todd |last=McCarthy |date=2002-07-29 |accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>

In 2004, the film was listed as No. 77 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]'' for the Brazilian birthday party scene.

===Box office===
''Signs'' grossed $227,966,634 domestically and $180,281,283 internationally, which would total up to $408,247,917 worldwide<ref name=BoxOfficeMojo /> at the [[box office]], ranking only behind ''The Sixth Sense'' in Shyamalan's box office success and grossing more than ''[[The Village (2004 film)|The Village]]'' and ''[[Split (2016 American film)|Split]]''.

===Home media===
''Signs'' was released on VHS and DVD on January 7, 2003. 

On the [[DVD]], there are some [[deleted scene]]s:
* ''Flashbacks 1 and 2'': Two scenes with Graham's wife, Colleen. In the first, she sits with a toddler Morgan and baby Bo in a rocking chair while Graham watches. In the second, she dances with him. She hums the same tune in both scenes.
* ''The dead bird'': With no sound, this scene shows Graham going back home from Ray's, and after a short time, a dead bird near the road (after supposedly hitting an invisible forcefield) is shown.
* ''The attic door and the third story'': The longest one, it starts with Merrill finding out about the not-boarded attic door. Despite Graham's efforts to call him back, Merrill goes up the stairs and manages to hold the door by climbing up a chair and putting his hands at the door. Trying to help, Graham looks for a way to hold the door. He gets a tall shelf and places it under the door. Knowing this is only a temporary solution, Graham gets his family and takes them to the kitchen and puts some chairs at the door to hold the aliens out of the room. There, he tells the "third story", about Merrill, in which he dislocated his arm. While Graham is telling the story, the shelf is destroyed from the attic door slamming on top of it repeatedly and the aliens gain access to the house. Everyone goes down to the basement, the only safe room available, as the aliens begin forcing the kitchen door open.
