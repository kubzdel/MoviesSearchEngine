==Plot==
{{more plot|date=March 2018}}
On 7 January 1972, the South Korean base in Nha-Trang, Vietnam, receives a radio transmission from a missing platoon that has been presumed dead. The high-command assigns the veteran and decorated Lieutenant Choi Tae-in to lead a squad of eight other soldiers to extract the missing soldiers from the Romeo point or R-Point. When they arrive at the location, they engage and defeat a Vietnamese woman with a machine gun. They later find a tombstone saying that one hundred years previously, local Vietnamese were killed by the Chinese who disposed of them in a lake. A temple built over the site has become a sacred location to the Vietnamese. They find an immense, but empty mansion, where they set up their base. They have a week to find the missing soldiers, but time is passing slowly when one of them dies in a horrific way, and instead of finding answers, they encounter further mysteries.
