'''''Hellraiser: Inferno''''' (also known as '''''Hellraiser V: Inferno'''''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miramax.com/movie/hellraiser-v-inferno/|title=Hellraiser V: Inferno - Official Site|website=Miramax.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref>) is a 2000 American [[horror film]]. It is the fifth installment in the [[Hellraiser (film series)|''Hellraiser'']] series and the first ''Hellraiser'' film to go [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]]. It was directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] and released on October 3, 2000. The film concerns a corrupt [[detective]] who discovers [[Lemarchand's box]] at a crime scene. The film's reviews were mixed.

== Plot ==
Joseph Thorne is a corrupt [[Denver]] police detective who regularly indulges in drug use and infidelity during the course of duty. At the scene of what appears to be a ritual murder, Thorne discovers a strange puzzle box, which he takes home in order to indulge his fascination with puzzles. After solving the box, Thorne begins to experience bizarre hallucinations, such as being seduced by a pair of mutilated women and being chased by a creature with no eyes or legs. Thorne also makes a connection between the murder and a killer known as  "[[List of Hellraiser characters#Engineer|The Engineer]]," who is suspected of having kidnapped a child. Thorne goes in search of the Engineer, who in turn begins murdering Thorne's friends and associates, leaving behind one of the child's fingers at every crime scene.

While undergoing therapy for his hallucinations, Thorne's psychiatrist reveals himself to be "[[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]]", the leader of a group of entities known as the [[Cenobite (Hellraiser)|Cenobites]], who use the puzzle box as a portal between their realm and the mortal realm. Pinhead informs Thorne that he has in fact been in the Cenobite's realm since opening the box, where they have been subjecting him to [[psychological torture]] for the various cruelties he has inflicted on others: The Engineer is a manifestation of Thorne's own cruelty, while the child is a personification of Thorne's innocence, which he has slowly been killing through corruption, hedonism, and violence. As hooked chains appear and begin to ensnare Thorne, Pinhead informs him that he will be subjected to an eternity of torment for his sins.

==Reception==
Calum Marsh for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' called the film "shockingly good" and said "''Inferno'' feels less like a Hellraiser movie than a follow-up to Jacob's Ladder (or maybe a predecessor to Silent Hill), floating dream-like through hallucinatory David Lynchian visions and downplaying plot in favor of the surreal."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a25313/hellraiser-v-review/ |title=The (Halloween) Netflix Streaming Endorsement: The Shockingly Good Hellraiser V |last=Marsh |first=Calum |date=2013-10-24 |website=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> ''[[JoBlo.com]]'' gave the film a seven out of ten rating and also felt the film wasn't very similar to its predecessors saying "Without a doubt the filmâ€™s biggest flaw is calling itself "Hellraiser"."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/hellraiser-5-inferno |title=Hellraiser 5: Inferno (2000) |website=[[JoBlo.com]] |access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>
