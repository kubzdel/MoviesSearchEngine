'''''Death Proof''''' is a 2007 American [[exploitation fiction|exploitation]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]]. It stars [[Kurt Russell]] as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] who murders young women in staged car accidents using his "death-proof" stunt car. It co-stars [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Vanessa Ferlito]], [[Jordan Ladd]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Sydney Tamiia Poitier]], [[Tracie Thoms]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], with stuntwoman [[Zoë Bell]] as herself. The film pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[Slasher film|slasher]], [[exploitation film|exploitation]] and [[muscle car]] films of the 1970s.

''Death Proof'' was released theatrically in the United States as part of a [[double feature]] with [[Robert Rodriguez]]’s ''[[Planet Terror]]'' under the collective title ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', to recreate the experience of viewing exploitation film double features in a "[[grindhouse]]" theater. The films were released separately outside the United States and on DVD, with ''Death Proof'' going on sale in the U.S. on September 18, 2007. The film was in the main competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]].

==Plot==

Three friends, Arlene, Shanna and radio DJ "Jungle" Julia Lucai, drive down [[Congress Avenue Historic District|Congress Avenue]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on their way to celebrate Julia's birthday. In a bar, Julia reveals that she made a radio announcement offering a free [[lap dance]] from Arlene in return for addressing her as "Butterfly", buying her a drink, and reciting a segment of the poem "[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]". Aging Hollywood [[stunt double]] "Stuntman" Mike trails the women to a bar and claims the lap dance. Arlene is suspicious, having seen Mike's car earlier that day, but he convinces her to give him the lap dance.

The women prepare to depart with Lanna, another friend. Pam, Julia's old classmate, accepts Mike's offer of a ride home. Mike takes Pam to his Hollywood stunt car rigged with a [[roll cage]] and tells her the car is "death proof", but only for the driver. He speeds and slams on the brakes, smashing Pam's skull on the dashboard, killing her. He catches up with the women's car and drives into it at speed, killing them. Mike survives with no serious injury. Sheriff McGraw believes Mike killed the women intentionally, but because Mike was sober while the women were intoxicated, he cannot be charged.

Fourteen months later, three young women, Abernathy Ross, Kim Mathis and Lee Montgomery, are driving through [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. They stop at a convenience store, where Mike watches them from his car. The women pick up their friend, stuntwoman [[Zoë Bell]], from the airport while Mike photographs them unawares. Zoë tells them she wants to test-drive a [[Dodge Challenger#First generation (1969–1974)|1970 Dodge Challenger]], the same type of car from the 1971 film ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'', for sale nearby. The owner lets them test-drive it unsupervised after Abernathy tells him Lee is a porn star and will stay behind.

Zoë tells Abernathy and Kim that she wants to play a game they call "Ship's Mast", whereby she [[Car surfing|rides the hood]] holding belts fastened to the car while Kim drives at speed. Kim is hesitant, but agrees. The three enjoy the stunt, unaware that Mike is watching them. He [[Rear-end collision|rear-ends]] them in his car, causing Zoë to drop one of the belts. After several more collisions, he [[Side collision|T-bones]] them, throwing Zoë from the hood. Kim shoots Mike in the shoulder and he flees in his car. Abernathy and Kim cry over the loss of their friend, until Zoë emerges uninjured. The three agree to catch up to Mike and kill him.

Mike has stopped in a narrow road to treat his wound with whiskey. The women rear-end him at speed. Zoë gets out and beats him with a pipe, but he resists and drives off again. After a long chase, the women push Mike's car off the road. They drag him from the wreckage and beat him to death.

==Production==
The story for ''Death Proof'' developed from Quentin Tarantino's fascination for the way [[stunt man|stuntmen]] would “death-proof” stunt cars so a driver could survive horrific, high-speed crashes and collisions. This inspired Tarantino to create a [[slasher film]] featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his “death-proof” car.<ref name="Wizard">{{cite web |url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm |title=House Party |accessdate=April 4, 2007 |last=Cotton |first=Mike |date=April 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard Universe]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927194539/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/004090803.cfm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref> Tarantino remembers, “I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of [[Women in prison films|women-in-prison films]], there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you.”<ref name="Stone">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/14022408/online_exclusive_horror_film_directors_dish_about_grindhouse_trailers |title=Online Exclusive: Horror Film Directors Dish About ‘Grindhouse’ Trailers |accessdate=April 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone.com]]}}</ref>

According to Robert Rodriguez, “[Tarantino] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started to tell me the story and said, ‘It’s got this death-proof car in it.’ I said, ‘You have to call it ''Death Proof''.’ I helped title the movie, but that’s it.”<ref name="Wizard"/> Of the car chases, Tarantino stated: “[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for car stunts doesn’t make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? […] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in ’92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in ''[[Terminator 2]]''. And ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there’s twelve cameras and they use every angle for [[Non-linear editing system|Avid editing]], but I don’t feel it in my stomach. It’s just action."<ref name="Stone"/> ''Death Proof'' marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer.

Tarantino attempted to cast [[John Travolta]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Ron Perlman]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Kal Penn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061121kalpenngrindhouse |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070722151341/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061121kalpenngrindhouse |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 22, 2007 |title=Did You Know: Kal Penn was cast in Tarantino's ''Grindhouse''? |accessdate=January 6, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |publisher=Ifilm }}</ref> and [[Sylvester Stallone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php?story=20061204stallonegrindhouse |title=Tarantino wanted Stallone for ''Grindhouse'' |accessdate=January 6, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Sciretta |publisher=Ifilm }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in ''Death Proof'', but none were able to work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he cast [[Kurt Russell]] as the killer stunt driver because "for people of my generation, he's a true hero…but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Dreamer (2005 film)|Dreamer]]'',' or 'Kurt Russell in ''[[Miracle (2004 film)|Miracle]]'',' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?”<ref name="Bloodbath">{{Cite news | last=Nashawaty| first=Chris| title =Bloodbath and Beyond | newspaper=Entertainment Weekly | pages =27–30 | date =March 30, 2007 | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20015706,00.html | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> [[Eli Roth]], ''Planet Terror'' leading actress Rose McGowan, and Tarantino himself appear in the film. Roth flew in from Europe, where he was filming ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', to film his scenes, which took one day.

After being stunned by stuntwoman [[Zoë Bell]], who worked as Uma Thurman's stunt double in Tarantino's earlier film ''[[Kill Bill]]'', Tarantino wrote her the leading female role. This was her first on-screen acting, which Bell initially thought was going to be a cameo role. The character Zoë was based on the stuntwoman herself and includes small stories based around her real life experiences, some with Tarantino. When her name was featured on the film posters opposite Kurt Russell, Rosario Dawson and Rose McGowan, she realized how big the role was.

''Death Proof'' uses various unconventional techniques to make the film appear more like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout the feature, the film was intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the [[1970s in film|1970s]] which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. A notable example of one of the film's deliberate jump-cuts is seen at the beginning, when the title ''Quentin Tarantino's Thunderbolt'' is shown for a split second before abruptly being replaced by an insert with the title ''Death Proof'', appearing in white lettering on a black background.<ref name="VFX">{{cite web | title=VFX World | work=Grindhouse: Pistol-Packing VFX | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=3235 | accessdate=April 18, 2007}}</ref> (Exploitation films were commonly retitled, especially if they received bad press on initial release.)

On the editing of ''Death Proof'', Tarantino stated, "There is half-an-hour's difference between my ''Death Proof'' and what is playing in ''Grindhouse''. […] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked."<ref name="Telegraph"/> An extended, 127-minute version of ''Death Proof'' was screened in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival|60th Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name="Telegraph"/><ref name="Cannes">{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070419/film_nm/cannes_dc_6 |title=Director Tarantino in competition in Cannes |publisher=Yahoo |date=April 19, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="Cannes archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013| title=Cannes Film Festival archives|publisher=Cannes Film Festival|accessdate=June 5, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204134/http://www.festival-cannes.com/index.php/en/archives/film/4432013 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref> Tarantino is quoted as saying, "It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see ''Death Proof'' unfiltered.

The soundtrack for ''Death Proof'' consists entirely of non-original music, including excerpts from the scores of other films. It was released on April 3, 2007, alongside the ''[[Planet Terror (soundtrack)|Planet Terror]]'' soundtrack. Both albums featured dialogue excerpts from the film.

==Release==
{{Main|Grindhouse (film)}}
''Death Proof'' was released in the US and Canada alongside ''[[Planet Terror]]'' as part of a [[double feature]] under the title ''Grindhouse''. Both films were released separately in extended versions internationally, approximately two months apart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ingloriousbastards.nl/grindhouse.php |title=Alles Over Quentin Tarantino |accessdate=March 30, 2007 |date=March 18, 2007 |language=Dutch |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211065903/http://www.ingloriousbastards.nl/grindhouse.php |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> The additional material includes scenes that were replaced in the American theatrical release version with a “missing reel” title card, such as the [[lap dance]] scene. A total of 27 minutes were added for this version.  One of the first screenings of ''Death Proof'' was made at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]] on August 20, 2007, with star Zoë Bell attending the screenings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=cannes2007&jump=review&reviewid=VE1117933735&cs=1&p=0 |title=Review of ''Death Proof'' |accessdate=June 22, 2007 |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |date=May 22, 2007 |work=Variety  }}</ref>

The Dutch poster artwork for ''Death Proof'' claimed that the film would feature "coming attractions" from Robert Rodriguez.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.a-film.nl/film.php?id=00002002 |title=Dutch ''Death Proof'' poster art |accessdate=April 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521044112/http://www.a-film.nl/film.php?id=00002002 |archivedate=May 21, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> In the United Kingdom, ''Death Proof'' was released on September 21, 2007, and in Australia on November 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=20659 |title=Grindhouse Dismantled |date=April 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235327/http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=20659 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> Explaining the split in foreign releases, Tarantino stated, "Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition … not only do they not really know what a grindhouse is, they don't even have the double feature tradition.

===Critical reception===
''Death Proof'' has received generally moderate reviews, earning a score of 65% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 40 reviews with an average rating of 5.8/10, the site's critical consensus reads: "''Death Proof'' may feel somewhat minor in the context of Tarantino's larger filmography, but on its own merits, it packs just enough of a wallop to deliver sufficiently high-octane grindhouse goods."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/death_proof/ |title=Death Proof (Grindhouse Presents) (2007) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}</ref>

''Empire'' magazine gave the film four out of five stars and a mostly positive review, describing the film as "Tarantino driving wildly under the influence" and "seriously entertaining".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=134990|title= Empire's Death Proof movie review| accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> The BBC's Anna Smith said that while there was "fun to be had" with the film, "its imitation of a defunct, low-budget style of movie-making is perhaps too accurate when it comes to the genre's flaws",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2007/09/17/death_proof_2007_review.shtml|title=BBC Movies Death Proof review|date=September 21, 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref> and gave the film three out of five stars. [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Grindhouse''  2.5 out of 4 stars, writing that while ''Death Proof'' was the more enjoyable half of the bill, it was still marred by overlong scenes of expository dialogue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071025/REVIEWS/710250304|title=Grindhouse|accessdate=May 12, 2009|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=October 26, 2007|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>

On the more negative end of the scale, ''The Guardian''{{'}}s [[Peter Bradshaw]] expressed admiration for the car crash scene, describing it as "a lethal roar of entertainment", but said that the film was padded with "long, long, long stretches of bizarrely inconsequential conversation […] which are a big comedown from the glorious riffs from ''Reservoir Dogs'' and ''Pulp Fiction''", and that overall "Tarantino's twisted genius is there for all to see – but, it must now be admitted, all too briefly".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/sep/21/quentintarantino.horror|title=The Guardian's Death Proof review|date=September 21, 2007|accessdate=February 23, 2013|location=London|first=Peter|last=Bradshaw}}</ref>

''Death Proof'' is generally considered to be Tarantino's weakest film, a sentiment that Tarantino himself agrees with, though he does not dislike the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAK3aUq25fo&t=51m04s |title=The Directors interview (2012)}}</ref> He said at a director's roundtable, "Death Proof has got to be the worst movie I ever make. And for a left-handed movie, that wasn’t so bad, all right? — so if that’s the worst I ever get, I’m good."<ref>Published November 28, 2012. http://collider.com/quentin-tarantino-death-proof-worst-film-interview/. Retrieved November 24, 2015.</ref>

===Home media===
''Death Proof'' was released on DVD in the US on September 18, 2007, in a two-disc special edition featuring the extended version of the film, documentaries on the casting of the film, the various [[muscle cars]] and Tarantino's relationship with [[Film editing|editor]] [[Sally Menke]], trailers, and an international poster gallery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R7HY0K |title=ASIN: B000R7HY0K |accessdate=June 10, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com }}</ref> On December 16, 2008, a [[Blu-ray Disc|BD]] release of identical content followed.

A Japanese DVD release has the films ''Grindhouse'', ''Death Proof'' and ''Planet Terror'', with extras and fake trailers, in a six-DVD box set (English with optional Japanese subtitles). ''Death Proof'' was also released as a German [[HD DVD]], believed to be the last film published in the now-defunct format.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/2072/deathproof_de.html |title=Death Proof (German Import) |accessdate=January 29, 2009 |work=Highdefdigest.com }}</ref>

The ''Grindhouse'' double feature was eventually released on Blu-ray Disc in October 2010.
