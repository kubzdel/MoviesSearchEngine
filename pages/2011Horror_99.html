'''''Little Deaths''''' is a 2011 British anthology [[horror film]] written and directed by Sean Hogan, Andrew Parkinson, and [[Simon Rumley]]. The film has three segments: ''House & Home'', ''Mutant Tool'', and ''Bitch''. Each segment is directed by a different author and are unrelated to one another in any way other than sharing a theme of sex and death.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rowan Legg|first=Shelagh M|title=Now on DVD: Little Deaths Revels in Sex And, Well, Death|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/08/dvd-review-little-deaths-revels-in-sex-and-well-death.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> Critical reviews for ''Little Deaths'' were polarized and the [[United Kingdom]] DVD release had to have some portions removed due to their sexually violent content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Little Deaths (UK DVD)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/little-deaths-uk-dvd#axzz2i8lnamBA|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Raffel|first=Lawrence P.|title=Interview: Explore The Psycho-Sexual Horror of 'Little Deaths'|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/interview-explore-psycho-sexual-horror-little-deaths|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref>

==Synopsis==

===House and Home===
In Sean Hogan's segment, Richard (Luke de Lacey) and Victoria (Siubhan Harrison) are a married couple that tries to solve their boredom by picking up homeless women under the guise of a [[Christianity|Christian]] charity, with the intent to abuse them sexually. When they pick up Sorrow ([[Holly Lucas]]), they soon discover that they have taken on more than they can handle and that Sorrow is not exactly the homeless woman that she seems to be.

===Mutant Tool===
The second segment was directed by Andrew Parkinson and follows Jen (Jodie Jameson), a prostitute that gains the ability to see frightening visions whenever she touches someone. She is also addicted to the emissions of the captive Mutant (Rob 'Sluggo' Boyce). His captor, Dr. Reese (Brendan Gregory), has been feeding him human kidneys as part of a twisted [[Nazism|Nazi]] experiment.

===Bitch===
[[Simon Rumley|Simon Rumley's]] short focuses on the dysfunctional relationship between Pete (Tom Sawyer) and Claire (Kate Braithwaite). Claire routinely subjects Pete to emotional and physical abuse and, in the bedroom, makes him participate in various [[BDSM]] activities such as forcing him to live and behave as a dog while he gets [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegged]]. Pete longs for his relationship with Claire to get better and for her to give him more respect and acceptance, but is pushed to his limit when Claire decides to sleep with his best friend Al (Tommy Carey).

==Development==
Hogan began planning the film anthology after a prior film project did not come to fruition.<ref name="TF1">{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Peter|title=SXSW 2011: Sean Hogan and Simon Rumley Talk LITTLE DEATHS|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2011/03/sxsw-2011-sean-hogan-and-simon-rumley-talk-about-little-deaths.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> He approached Parkinson and Rumley with the idea, as Hogan believed that the differences in their filmmaking styles would work well in an anthology setting.<ref name="TF1" /> The three collaborated on the film as a whole in the pre-production stages, but "kind of went [their] separate ways" after production began.<ref name="TF1" />

Hogan has stated that he and Rumley initially had difficulty casting the roles for their segments ''House & Home'' and ''Bitch'', as many actors declined to participate after reading the scripts.<ref name="WSJ">{{cite news|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|title=Sean Hogan and Simon Rumley Make Big Waves With â€˜Little Deaths'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/18/sean-hogan-and-simon-rumley-make-big-waves-with-little-deaths/|accessdate=19 October 2013|newspaper=WSJ|date=18 March 2011}}</ref>
