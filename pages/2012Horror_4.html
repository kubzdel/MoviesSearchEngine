==Plot==
The film begins with a baby, Sebastian, being born. After Sebastian viciously murders the doctors who delivered him, his mother ([[Sara Malakul Lane]]) realizes that there is something seriously wrong with the child (it is later revealed that he is the son of the devil).  Over the course of the movie, Sebastian brutally murders many people and tragedy strikes many others. Mahari ([[Jesus Guevara]]) attempts to steal the baby from Sebastian's birth parents many times and eventually does. He steals Sebastian in order to embrace his evil calling. Police officers attempt to kill Mahari but Mahari and his companions use Sebastian to murder them. The movie ends with all the main characters dead, and their deaths were associated in some way to Sebastian.

''[[Dread Central]]'' called it an "[[The Omen|Omen]]-esque horror flick titled after the date on which its hellspawn will be born".<ref name="Dread Central"/>  Filming the project created controversy in Thailand, in which set photos showing Sara Malakul Lane in costume looking as if pregnant were mistakenly thought to be real, for there are cultural taboos there about unwed motherhood.<ref name="Dread Central">{{cite news|last1=Foy|first1=Scott|title=The Spawn of Satan Will be Born on 12-12-12 and We Have His Exclusive First Baby Photos|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/36112/the-spawn-of-satan-will-be-born-on-12-12-12-and-we-have-his-exclusive-first-baby-photos/|accessdate=May 18, 2015|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|date=August 12, 2012}}</ref>
