==Critical reception==
Critical reviews of the movie were quite bad. Agusto M. Torres wrote in [[El País (Spain)|El País]] that there are "irregularities in the development of history" and that "the villain is the most difficult to figure out and lacks any kind of reason, moral or psychological, to be a serial murderer" but he also indicates that it has an "effective and fine humor".<ref>[https://elpais.com/diario/2001/07/20/cine/995580059_850215.html Miedo 'made in Spain'] in El País</ref>[[Carlos Aguilar (writer)|Carlos Aguilar]] in his ''Guía del cine español'' describes the movie as "incoherent and forced" but better than other contemporary Spanish slasher films such as ''[[El arte de morir]]'' or ''[[School Killer]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last= Aguilar |first= Carlos |title= Guía del cine español |url= |accessdate= |language= |others= |year= 2007 |editor= |publisher= Cátedra |isbn=978-84-376-2419-8 |page= 1040 }}</ref>
