==Reviews==
[[Bloody Disgusting]]'s John Leal rated the film 8 out of 10 and wrote in his page; "Overall, The Forbidden Door is a highly recommended Indonesian effort whose storyline gives us a very unique experience that comes well written and with plenty of horror to offset and in fact compliment the drama. Anwarâ€™s direction is equally amazing, giving us a full-frontal approach to the well-executed horror sequences that set this film apart from most of what I have seen in recent time".<ref>John Leal (2009) [http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/film/5387/review/ Forbidden Door review] [[Bloody Disgusting]].

[[Twitch Film]]'s Ard Vijn said in his page that; "Joko Anwar wants to keep his movies accessible for the general public while telling them an outrageous story at the same time, and like with "Kala" it's amazing how well he succeeds. "The Forbidden Door" looks gorgeous (despite its budget!) and jumps effortlessly from genre to genre without alienating its audience." Ard Vijn also wrote in his page that the audience at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam|IFFR]] awarded "The Forbidden Door" a very respectable 4.0 out of 5 so maybe people are used to a lot more gore than I expected...<ref>Vijn, Ard.

In 2009 at the [[New York Asian Film Festival]], the film was described as a "19th century gothic novel adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and directed by David Lynch" and "one of the sickest, kinkiest movies".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2010/02/sfiaaff28-the-forbidden-door-pintu-terlarang-2009-the-twitch-round-up.html|title=SFIAAFF28: THE FORBIDDEN DOOR (PINTU TERLARANG, 2009): The Twitch Round-up |publisher=Twitch Film|last=Guillen|first=Michael|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>
