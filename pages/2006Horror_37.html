{{nihongo|'''''Cat Eyed Boy'''''|猫目小僧|Nekome Kozō|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[shōnen manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Kazuo Umezu]]. The story is narrated by the titular cat-eyed boy, hated by both humans and demons, who gets involved in tales of horror including monsters and children. The manga was initially serialized in 1967 in [[Shōnen Gahōsha]]'s manga magazine ''Shōnen Gaho'' and eventually two other magazines, and has been compiled and published several times in different formats. In 2008, [[Viz Media]] licensed and released the manga in North America in two [[Omnibus edition|omnibus]] volumes. The manga has also been adapted into an [[anime series]] in 1976 and a [[live-action film]] in 2006. The manga has been noted for Umezu's grotesque style of [[Japanese horror]] storytelling and art. Response to the design of the Viz edition has also been positive.

==Reception==
Response to the manga has been positive overall, with critics applauding Umezu's grotesque style of horror, but also recognizing its similarities to low-budget horror of the past. Critics have likened the manga to [[Pulp magazine|pulp horror]] and to the television series ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'', but also acknowledged its divergences such as the focus on the narrator himself. The art has been complimented for creating a dark atmosphere, as well as for Umezu's imaginative monsters. Critics have also noted that the manga will likely be more appealing to audiences interested in manga classics rather than modern horror fans. Opinions on the effectiveness of the short and long stories has been mixed.

Carlo Santos of [[Anime News Network]] criticized the similarities of the stories to [[B movie| B-horror]] movies as well as the weakness of the shorter monster-based stories, but commended Umezu's ability to "create a chilling portrait of the human soul".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=Carlo|title=Cat Eyed Boy GN 2|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cat-eyed-boy/gn-2|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=15 June 2015}}</ref> [[Shaenon K.
