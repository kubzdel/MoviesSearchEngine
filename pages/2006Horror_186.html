'''''Snakes on a Train''''' is a 2006 [[direct-to-video]] [[Action film|action]] [[horror film]] released by [[The Asylum]] as a [[mockbuster]] on August 15, 2006.<ref>[http://www.theasylum.cc/product.php?id=120 The Asylum]</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0843873/ IMDb]</ref> Many aspects of the film are inspired by the film ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'', which was scheduled for theatrical release three days later on August 18, 2006.

==Plot==
Although taking the same basic idea from ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' (lots of deadly [[snakes]] loose on a [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], high speed means of transport), the background story of how the snakes end up on the train is completely different. 

In the film, a woman has been put under a [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n curse which causes snake eggs to hatch inside her belly and eat their way out. In order to recover the "lost pieces" of herself (the snakes), she must travel to [[Los Angeles]] where a powerful Mayan [[shaman]] can lift the curse. She takes the snakes along with her in small jars. While on the train, bandits attack her, allowing the snakes to escape, endangering the rest of the passengers.

Eventually, and inexplicably, she herself transforms into a gigantic snake and swallows the moving train whole.

Six passengers manage to escape unharmed, and one of them performs a magic ritual which causes her to vanish. However, one girl is shown to have been unknowingly bitten, suggesting that the curse will remain.

==Production==
According to co-producer David Rimawi, The Asylum initially had no intention of making the film, but they proceeded when an earlier film project fell through. While looking for international distributors at [[Cannes]], a group of Japanese investors saw the film's poster and asked if there really was a giant snake eating a train (which was originally not part of the film). In response, Rimawi had his crew in Los Angeles add the aforementioned scene to the film to make the Japanese audiences happy.<ref name="Adult Swim">{{cite web |url=http://www.adultswim.com/blog/interviews/how-to-make-a-mockbuster.html |title=How to Make a Mockbuster (In Five Easy Steps) |author=Solomon, Dan |publisher=[[Adult Swim]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-24}} (note that the article misspelled David Rimawi's name as "Rimaldi")</ref>
