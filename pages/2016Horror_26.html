'''''Blair Witch''''' is a 2016 American [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Adam Wingard]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-woods-trailer-adam-wingard-found-footage-horror-20160510|work=Indiewire|title=''The Woods'' Trailer: Adam Wingard Takes Us Camping in New Found-Footage Horror Flick|author=Nordine, Michael|date=May 10, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> and written by [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]]. It is the third official film in the ''[[Blair Witch]]'' series and a direct sequel to the 1999 film ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ignoring the events of its 2000 follow-up film ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'', given the events of that film being a [[play within a play|film within a film]].{{efn|name=BookOfShadows|In the tie-in documentary to ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'', ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'', the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are presented in-universe as a film adaptation based on the "Black Hills murders" that took place shortly after the events of ''The Blair Witch Project''. This documentary presents the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows "the real Jeff Patterson"’s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case’s events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the "real" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.}} ''Blair Witch'' stars [[James Allen McCune]], [[Callie Hernandez]], Brandon Scott, Corbin Reid, Wes Robinson, and [[Valorie Curry]]. The film, shot in a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] style, follows a group of college students and their local guides who venture into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to uncover the mysteries surrounding the disappearance years ago of Heather Donahue, the sister of one of the characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/07/adam-wingards-the-woods-is-actually-a-sequel-to-the-blair-witch-project/|title=Adam Wingard's ''The Woods'' is actually a sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project''|date=July 23, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=July 25, 2016}}</ref> Initially, the film's connection to the ''Blair Witch'' franchise was kept secret, with the film having been shot under the fake title, ''The Woods''. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries must be generic and CANNOT EXCEED 400-700 WORDS. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED NOT TO EXTEND THE SUMMARY ANY FURTHER.-->
In 2014, James Donahue finds a video on [[YouTube]] containing an image of a woman he believes to be his sister [[The Blair Witch Project#Cast|Heather]], who [[The Blair Witch Project#Plot|disappeared in 1994]] near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] while investigating the legend of the [[Blair Witch]]. Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by his friend Peter Jones, Peter’s girlfriend Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''The Absence of Closure''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/891264965/the-absence-of-closure/posts/1665045/ |title=The Absence of Closure by Lisa Arlington |website=Kickstarter.com |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://absenceofclosure.tumblr.com/ |title=The Absence of Closure |website=Absenceofclosure.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them.

While walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices [[twine]] in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friend banish Lane and Talia from their group and head out of the woods. 

After hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, soon being chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears. 

Lane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the dishevelled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away.

A rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears someone he thinks is Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting dishevelled figure;{{efn|name=HeatherDonahue|Though glimpsed briefly, the figure indeed appears to be Heather Donahue as she appeared in the closing scenes of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', complete with her torn cardigan and hat. In an interview with [[Adam Wingard]], the film's director, it was later confirmed that the archival footage of Heather Donahue was intentionally meant to portray the Blair Witch in the form of Heather.}} upon its vanishing he barricades himself.

Lisa spots the unknown entity, a tall, pale, long-limbed creature moving through the trees, and she runs into the house's basement. She finds an aged and hostile Lane who traps her in an underground tunnel as “you have to do what she tells you”. The tunnel connects to a different part of the house, where Lisa stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the [[bootstrap paradox|paradox]] video that lured them all to the woods.{{efn|name=ParadoxExplained|Early on in the film, as the group makes its way deep into the woods, Lisa asks Lane about his camera, an older model that she notes uses the exact same tape as the one he claims to have found. The footage Lisa records on Lane’s camera while running through the shack is the same footage Lane found in the woods before the group ever actually went there, implying that they have been caught in a time loop}}

She reunites with James in the attic and they try to barricade the door. A bright light shines from outside the building, moving until stopping at the door, indicating the arrival of the witch. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her before the witch enters, alongside her creature. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns, and vanishes, leaving her camera behind before it gives out.

==Production==

Wingard first ran into the original ''The Blair Witch Project'' filmmakers, [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[Eduardo Sánchez (director)|Eduardo Sánchez]], while promoting ''[[V/H/S/2]]'' at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], and asked them why there were not any more ''Blair Witch'' films. Although nothing came of the meeting at the time, looking back on it, writer Simon Barrett had opined that the conversation led to them being asked by Lionsgate to produce the sequel.<ref name="storybehind">{{cite web|title=[Interview] The Story Behind the ‘Blair Witch’ Revival|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404167/interview-story-behind-blair-witch-revival/|website=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref> Barrett recalled that, in the initial pitch meeting, Lionsgate had already crafted a synopsis for the film, and simply asked if he would be interested in making it, and the "only thing I really pitched was the other characters; they’d originally conceived the film as more similar to the first film, following its narrative fairly closely, with only three or four characters, I think, but I wanted more characters to give us more scare sequences. I also wanted a unique dynamic within the group from the start, so I pitched the idea of introducing some Burkittsville locals to the group."<ref name="storybehind"/>

Barrett would later note that the team found that the found footage genre more challenging, as they have only previously worked with it on the ''V/H/S'' [[Anthology film|anthology movies]].<ref name="scaryshoot">{{cite web|title=[Interview] ‘Blair Witch’ Was Just as Scary to Make, Explains Writer Simon Barrett|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3404168/interview-writer-simon-barrett-says-making-blair-witch-just-scary-make/|website=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}</ref> Barrett noted that with the ''V/H/S'' series, there was an inherent entertainment value, where the segments "were never meant to feel entirely real", an element that did not work for the ''Blair Witch'' series.<ref name="scaryshoot"/> Speaking on the issue to [[Bloody Disgusting]], Barrett stated "even if our scares didn’t work in ''V/H/S'', hopefully people would still be entertained, and if they weren’t, well, another short would start in a few minutes"; he added that if a scare did not work in ''Blair Witch'', "we’d have nothing to fall back on, we’d just have failed completely, and publicly." To prevent this from happening, Barrett and Winger extensively went over each "scare" to discover why it was scary and how the audience would react to it. For some sequences, multiple approaches were tried differently, "to give us options in the editing room."<ref name="scaryshoot"/>

Principal photography took place in the spring of 2015, in a set of woods in [[British Columbia]] in Canada. Scenes taking place in the famous Blair Witch House where shot in a sound stage where the House was entirely built.

Prior to the film's premiere at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], the fact that the film was a ''Blair Witch'' sequel remained a closely guarded secret,<ref name="blairwitchindiewire">{{cite web|last1=Calvario|first1=Liz|title=''Blair Witch'': How Filmmakers Were Able to Keep the Sequel Under Wraps for Three Years|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/blair-witch-filmmakers-keep-sequel-secret-adam-wingard-1201709261/|website=Indiewire|accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> as the film was shot under the title ''The Woods''.<ref name="blairwitchindiewire"/> According to the film's writer, Barrett, the film's secrecy was done to prevent backlash among Internet commenters, who the filmmakers felt would react negatively to news of a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]].<ref name="blairwitchsecret"/> Prior to the official premiere, Lionsgate went as far as to release a trailer for the film incorporating actual footage, while still keeping the film's lineage a secret.<ref name="blairwitchindiewire"/>  The film was still publicly known as ''The Woods'' even at Comic-Con, prior to its first screening, with [[io9]] reporting that the initial theater for the screening was filled with posters for the fake film.
