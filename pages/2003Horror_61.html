'''''LD 50 Lethal Dose''''' was a 2003 [[horror film]] directed by Simon De Selva, produced by Alistair MacLean-Clark and Basil Stephens and written by Matthew McGuchan. A group of animal rights activists set off to free an imprisoned colleague from a terrifying ordeal but their rescue mission turns into a series of twisted and mind bending incidents. Starring [[Tom Hardy]], Katharine Towne and [[Mel B|Melanie Brown]].

==Plot==
Animal [[activists]] break into an animal research facility, when Gary (McCall) gets caught in a bear trap. Unable to free Gary, the rest of the group flees, leaving Gary to take the blame. A year later, the group has since disbanded until an encrypted e-mail from Gary arrives asking for help. Danny (Bill), who has been visiting Gary in [[prison]], tells the group that Gary has traded his body for experiments in exchange for a reduced sentence.

The group, still stricken by guilt one year later, eagerly reunites to rescue Gary. They also pick up two new recruits â€” a [[Stoner (drug user)|stoner]] and an ex-[[Marine (military)|Marine]]. At the remote lab where Gary is being kept, the group discovers the place abandoned, and soon finds themselves locked in a [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranean]] level full of [[labyrinthine]] hallways and experiment chambers. They also discover that a powerful electrical force is stalking them, and it has full control of the complex. The force plays havoc with the would-be rescuers, turning their righteous cause into a death trap. They must work together to outsmart and defeat the unseen evil.<ref>{{cite web|title=LD 50 Lethal Dose (2003) Movie Review|url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/ld-50-lethal-dose-2003-movie-review/|publisher=Beyond Hollywood|accessdate=31 July 2012|date=31 May 2004}}</ref>
