'''''Zombie King and the Legion of Doom''''', also known as '''''Enter... Zombie King''''' and '''''Zombie Pool Party''''', is a 2003 Canadian [[comedy horror]] [[lucha film]] directed by [[Stacey Case]], written by Bill Marks and Sean K. Robb, and starring Jules Delmore, Raymond Carle, Jennifer Thom, and Rob "El Fuego" Etcheverria as masked Mexican wrestlers (''[[luchadore]]s'') who fight zombies.

== Plot ==
''[[Luchadore]]s'' Ulysses and Blue Saint discover that Tiki is wrestling zombies.  Their worries are put to rest when Tiki reveals that the zombies have been domesticated.  However, Tiki's zombies are soon blamed for a wave of violent zombie attacks.  The ''luchadores'' research the attacks and are led to the lair of the Zombie King, who seeks to conquer the world.

== Cast ==
* Jules Delmore as Ulysses
* Jennifer Thom as Mercedes
* Raymond Carle as Blue Saint
* Rob "El Fuego" Etcheverria as Tiki
* Sean K. Robb as Mister X
* [[Nick Cvjetkovich|Sinn Bodhi]] as Zombie King
* Jason Winn Bareford as Murdelizer
* [[Jim Neidhart]] as Sheriff Logan

== Production ==
Shooting took place in Toronto over a three-week period in December 2002.  Professional wrestlers were hired to train the actors, but they did not have enough time.  Instead, the wrestlers were brought in as actors and stuntmen.  The film was then rewritten to show off the abilities of the wrestlers.  The Zombie King was originally slated to be played by [[George A. Romero]], but Romero had to bow out due to health concerns.  Wrestler Sinn Bodhi replaced Romero.  Rob "El Fuego" Etcheverria, who played Tiki, also worked as the [[stunt coordinator]].  In order to properly emulate [[lucha film]]s, the crew intentionally added continuity errors and poor dubbing.  The film was not meant as a parody, though.<ref name=canoe/>

== Release ==
On November 21, 2003, the film premiered in Toronto, Ontario.<ref name=canoe/>

== Reception ==
Meredith Renwick of [[Canoe.ca]] called the film "a high-camp, low-budget melange of masked wrestlers, hokey dialogue, spurting blood and gratuitous nudity" that is more fun than bigger-budgeted [[high concept]] films.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/11/27/270250.html|title=''Enter...Zombie King'' full of gory goodness|last=Renwick|first=Meredith|work=[[Canoe.ca]]|date=2003-11-27|accessdate=2013-12-12}}</ref>  Mike Adair of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' wrote that the fight scenes are surprisingly simple, but the action scenes are energetic enough to make up for it.  Adair also stated that the film will appeal to any fan of [[B movie]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/Reviews/Dvd/enter_zombie_king-stacey_case?fid5=1|title=Enter...
