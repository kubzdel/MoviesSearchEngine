On their way through the streets of Gothenburg, they run into several obstacles. For example, they come across an Italian assassin and some Swedish reporters on the wrong side of the barricades.

==Soundtrack==
Over 21 bands contributed to the soundtrack, among them [[Dark Funeral]] and [[Sturm Café]]. Sturm Café's song "Die Zombiejäger" was written for the film and is used as a main theme throughout the movie. "Godhate" by Dark Funeral is played in the opening credits and "Related Skin" by Red Cell is played during the final battle and over the closing credits. [[Aardia]] wrote the original score. A soundtrack was released featuring several of the more prominent songs. There were some controversy when it turned out the producers did not have the right to release the songs on a soundtrack CD.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[Jonas Wolcher|Wolcher]] was not prosecuted however.
