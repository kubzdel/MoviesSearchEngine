==Plot==
<!--per WP:FILMPLOT, plots should be between 400 and 700 words-->
<!--As of August 30, 2016 plot is 762 words, please make it shorter, not longer-->
Max Cartwright waits in the car while her actress mother, Amanda, auditions for a film. When she returns, Amanda complains that, for the rest of her career, she will be known for her role as [[scream queen]] Nancy in the 1986 [[slasher film]] ''Camp Bloodbath'', now a [[cult film|cult classic]]. On the way home, the two get into a car accident and Amanda is killed.

Three years later, on the anniversary of her mother's death, Max studies with her friends Gertie and Chris. Gertie's stepbrother Duncan, a horror film fan, shows up and persuades Max to attend a special double-feature showing of ''Camp Bloodbath'' and its sequel, ''Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer''. At the screening, Max is none too happy that Chris' possessive ex-girlfriend – and her former best friend – Vicki is also there. During the film, members of the audience accidentally set the theater ablaze. In order to get the group to safety, Max uses a [[machete]] to cut a hole in the screen and they all step through.

Max, Chris, Gertie, Duncan, and Vicki wake up in the woods. Every 92 minutes, they encounter a van with two characters from ''Camp Bloodbath'', and realize they have somehow been transported inside the movie. The group awkwardly pass themselves off as new camp counselors, and hitch a ride to camp. They let the first couple of murders happen without interference, but when Duncan is killed by the film's machete-wielding villain Billy Murphy, they realize that they too run the risk of becoming victims.

The group decides to stop the cast from having sex, as whenever someone does so in ''Camp Bloodbath'', they fall prey to Billy's machete. Chris distracts Kurt, while Max persuades Nancy to stay a virgin. Vicki sticks with Paula, the movie's [[final girl]] and Gertie bonds with Blake, a counselor. When Gertie brings up the topic of Billy Murphy, the counselors are alerted to the fact that the "[[urban legend]]" of Billy is "real" and will come to kill them. In a panic, the counselors try to flee the camp. Kurt and Paula drive off, but when Duncan emerges still alive, the car hits him then crashes into a totem pole, resulting in their deaths.

Now aware that the characters who originally survived the movie can die, Max and the others decide to save anyone they can. They dress Tina in a life jacket and mittens, to prevent her from undressing. They also decide that Max, the only remaining [[virgin]], is the new final girl, and plot to get Billy's machete into her hands so she can kill him and end the film. Meanwhile, Max and Nancy bond, and theorize that, if Nancy survives the movie, she can go back home with Max and be whomever she wants.

The group booby trap the cabin, then Tina lures Billy to them by performing a striptease. Tina panics and is killed when a trip wire sends her headfirst into a bear trap. Blake, Vicki and Gertie are killed fighting Billy. Chris, Nancy, and Max flee the cabin, and Billy chases after them. Chris is stabbed, and Billy kidnaps Nancy. Max finds her at Billy's barn hideout, and the two women fight him, which results in Max getting stabbed, before they both escape.

After the two retreat to the chapel, Max tells Nancy that her real life counterpart is Max's mother. They bid each other a tearful farewell before Nancy sacrifices herself by luring Billy with a striptease. Max collapses, but, now the final girl, she awakens with the power to kill Billy. They fight and she eventually decapitates him with his own machete. A wounded Chris arrives and the two kiss, while ''Camp Bloodbath''{{'s}} closing credits play in the sky. Later, Max wakes to find herself in the hospital, where she is reunited with her friends. The group hears Billy Murphy's approach tune, and realize they are in the sequel, ''Camp Bloodbath 2: Cruel Summer''. Billy crashes through the glass doors of the hospital as the title appears. Using a drip stand as a weapon, Max lunges at Billy, before the film abruptly ends.

The soundtrack for the film, titled '''''The Final Girls: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''', featuring the original score by Gregory James Jenkins, was released via [[Music download|digital download]] on November 13, 2015 by [[Varèse Sarabande]], prior to a physical CD release on December 4, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/11/03/the-final-girls-soundtrack-announced/|title='The Final Girls' Soundtrack Announced|website=Film Music Reporter|date=November 3, 2015|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}</ref>

Gregory James Jenkins composed the [[Film score|music for the film]], having previously written the music for two of Strauss-Schulson's short films and debut feature ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicreporter.com/2015/11/03/the-final-girls-soundtrack-announced/|title='The Final Girls' Soundtrack Announced|website=Film Music Reporter|date=November 3, 2015}}</ref> Jenkins stated, "One of the biggest challenges was trying to create a score that was heavily steeped in 1980's while still trying to bring something new to the table... This is not your typical film score, as it's mostly electronic based... A lot of analog synths were used."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scoretrackinenglish.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/varese-sarabande-to-release-the-final-girls-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/|title=Varèse Sarabande to Release 'The Final Girls' – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|website=ScoreTrack.net|date=November 3, 2015}}</ref>

It holds a 71% approval rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 58 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Final Girls'' offers an affectionate nod to slasher tropes while adding a surprising layer of genuine emotion to go with the meta amusement."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/The_Final_Girls/|title=The Final Girls (2015)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a rating of 59 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-final-girls|title=The Final Girls Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>

The film was ranked #9 on [[BuzzFeed]]'s 19 Best Horror Films of 2015 list,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/best-horror-films-2015#.beJMn2MX0|title=The 19 Best Horror Films Of 2015|website=[[BuzzFeed]]|first=Louis|last=Peitzman|date=December 30, 2015|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref> and ranked #10 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} 10 Best Horror Movies of 2015 list.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/lists/10-best-horror-movies-of-2015-20151223/the-final-girls-20151223|title=10 Best Horror Movies of 2015|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 23, 2015|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}</ref>

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave a positive review, writing, "Though not quite as inspired or consistent as the similarly self-mocking likes of ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'', ''[[Tucker & Dale vs. Evil]]'' or the first two ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' pics, this is good fun that should delight genre fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-the-final-girls-1201452984/|title=SXSW Film Review: 'The Final Girls'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dennis|last=Harvey|date=March 14, 2015|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}</ref> Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "Genre enthusiasts will get a kick out of [[Todd Strauss-Schulson]]'s creative homage to classic slasher movies, which respects familiar horror conventions while introducing a sly contemporary perspective."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/final-girls-laff-review-805374|title='The Final Girls': LAFF Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Justin|last=Lowe|date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> Laura Kern of ''[[Film Comment]]'' called the film a "sharp, wickedly funny, and unexpectedly heartfelt homage" to slasher films, adding, "It's a gimmicky premise, perhaps, but a highly effective one. No mere meta-exercise, the film innovatively blends the worlds of the 1986 teens of ''Camp Bloodbath'' with the modern-day ones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/review-the-final-girls-todd-strauss-schulson/|title=Short Takes: The Final Girls|website=[[Film Comment]]|first=Laura|last=Kern|date=September 14, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref>
