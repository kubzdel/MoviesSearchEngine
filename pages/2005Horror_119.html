'''''Man-Thing''''' is a 2005 [[Australian-American]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Brett Leonard]] and featuring the [[Marvel Comics]] [[swamp creature]] [[Man-Thing]] created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Roy Thomas]], and [[Gerry Conway]]. The plot is based on a storyline by [[Steve Gerber]], who wrote the best-known series of ''Man-Thing'' comics.
Agents of an oil tycoon vanish while exploring a swamp marked for drilling. The local sheriff investigates and faces a [[Seminole]] legend come to life: Man-Thing, a shambling swamp-monster.
 
The film appeared on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in 2005 under the [[Syfy#Syfy Original Films|Sci Fi Pictures]] label. It starred [[Matthew Le Nevez]], [[Rachael Taylor]], and [[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]. The film was released theatrically in a handful of International markets. The film was a [[box office bomb]] grossing only $1 million and received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
At Dark Waters, a Native American sacred land containing an enigmatic swamp spirit, a teenager is murdered by a plant-like monster. The following day, young replacement sheriff Kyle Williams reaches Bywater and meets with deputy sheriff Fraser, who tells him the previous sheriff is among 47 missing persons since oil tycoon Fred Schist bought the ancient tribal lands from shaman and [[Seminole]] chieftain Ted Sallis, the first to disappear. Schist claimed Sallis had sold the lands legally and then escaped with the money. Schist then asked the sheriff for help: Local protestors opposed his perfectly legal activities, and [[mestizo]] scoundrel Renee Laroque was sabotaging his facilities. Williams investigates this while trying to find an explanation for the missing people, some of which were found brutally murdered with plants growing from inside their bodies. Photographer Mike Ploog and shaman Pete Horn tell Williams local legends about the guardian spirit, suggesting that it could be real.

As sabotage and murder continue, Williams investigates the swamp with Fraser and finds the previous sheriff's corpse. Medical examiner Val Mayerik admits that the previous sheriff had ordered him to file the deaths as alligator attacks, even if Mayerik believed otherwise.

Williams and Fraser try to track Laroque, who lives in the swamp, by using a canoe. At the same time, Schist sends the Thibadeux brothers, local thugs, to track and murder Laroque. The monster in the swamp finds the Thibadeux and kills them. Williams is ensnared by Laroque, who admits having helped Schist buy the lands. Laroque claims that Sallis was opposed to the sale; Laroque insists that the guardian spirit would keep on murdering until Schist stops desecrating the sacred swamp. Fraser tries to help Laroque, but the Man-Thing timely appears and murders Fraser; Laroque knocks Williams down and escapes. Williams wakes up and finds Ploog, who has blurry pictures of the monster; the sheriff seizes the photographs and forbids Ploog to come back to the swamp.

The following day, Williams interviews Horn and Schist, with the help of schoolteacher Teri Richards' help. Williams starts having romantic feelings for Richards. Horn goes to the swamp and tries to stop the Man-Thing with prayers and sacrificing his own life. The monster kills Horn, but is not otherwise affected by his efforts. That night, Mayerik autopsies the old sheriff and finds a bullet. He tries to tell Williams, but he is back at the swamp, unreachable. Mayerik tells Richards, and she goes to the swamp to tell Williams. Meanwhile, Ploog had returned to the swamp, trying to get a picture of the monster. Instead he startles Fred Schist, who was in the swamp to murder Laroque. Schist shoots and kills Ploog. Soon afterward, Laroque ambushes and defeats Schist's son and minion Jake.

Williams finds Ploog's corpse and reasons that Schist murdered Ploog. He then meets Richards, who tells him about Mayerik's autopsy. Williams concludes that Schist is guilty of several murders, trying to incriminate Laroque simply to avoid punishment. According to Schist's confession to Laroque, he murdered Sallis and buried him in Dark Waters. Due to the magic embedded in the soil, Sallis returned as the Man-Thing. Richards reveals that she can guide Williams to Laroque's lair, but the Man-Thing starts chasing them. He chases them to the drilling tower at Dark Waters. In the tower, Schist is leveling his weapon at Laroque in an attempt to prevent Laroque from blowing it away with dynamite. Laroque nonetheless tries to detonate his bomb and is shot and wounded by Schist; Schist then wounds Williams.

However, the Man-Thing arrives and brutally murders Schist by filling his body with oil. The Man-Thing then moves toward Williams and Richards. Laroque sacrifices himself shouting at the monster and blowing the bomb. The monster survives the flames, but then is absorbed back to the land.

===Development===
In 2000, [[Marvel Entertainment]] entered into a joint venture agreement with [[Artisan Entertainment]] to turn at least 15 Marvel superhero franchises into live-action films, television series, direct-to-video films and internet projects. These franchises included an adaptation of Man-Thing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Michael|title=Artisan deal a real Marvel|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/news/artisan-deal-a-real-marvel-1117781709/|accessdate=May 10, 2016|work=Variety|agency=Deadline Hollywood|date=May 16, 2000}}</ref>

===Post-production===
On October 27, 2003 it was reported that [[Artisan Entertainment]], which had partnered with [[Marvel Enterprises]] in production [[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]] and Man-Thing films, was being purchase by [[Lionsgate Films]].<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/features/83599-the-punisher-man-thing-studio-bought-by-lions-gate</ref> In February 2004, the film production and distribution company [[Lionsgate]] merged with Artisan Entertainment and received the film rights to [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Man-Thing]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>http://www.thegeektwins.com/2015/02/who-owns-man-thing-movie-rights-now.html#.V-8G_ev3aK1/ Who Owns the Man-Thing Movie Rights Now?, October 2, 2015
</ref> In January 2004, producer [[Avi Arad]] said Man-Thing was more of a departure from the original comic than were Marvel's other film character in that it was a [[horror film]] with a menacing central character.<ref name=schroeder2006 /> On April 2004, the film had been completed, with the finished print received and waiting to be tested with audiences, after which an exact release date would be determined. The film was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated R]] for violence, grisly images, language and some sexuality by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).<ref name=schroeder2006 />

The film had a production budget of $30 million.<ref name =B/> Avi Arad, then CEO of [[Marvel Studios]], admitted it was a mistake not keeping tabs on the production, as it was being filmed so far away in [[Australia]]. He stated "The one hiccup we had was the one project we didn't micromanage. We were not going to the Outback, there was so much going on. We will never do that again. We should never have trusted anybody that far away without our supervision. Thankfully it was a small movie and not a disaster. If we were there and on top of it, it would have been a[n] amazing movie. I look at the {horror} genre, and I think 'Sh--, I can't believe this'. We've learned our lesson."<ref name =B/>

===Filming===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
''Man-Thing'' was shot completely on location in [[Sydney, Australia]]. Shooting locations included [[Wisemans Ferry, New South Wales|Wisemans Ferry]], Serenity Cove Studios at [[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]] for exterior swamp scenes and [[Homebush Bay]].<ref>http://www.superherohype.com/news/83205-man-thing-set-locations-revealed</ref> The principle photography for ''Man-Thing'' concluded in 2003.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Effects===
[[Marvel Studios]] producer [[Avi Arad]] said "the lead character in the Man-Thing movie would be a combination of prosthetics and computer-generated effects.<ref name=schroeder2006 />
From the outset, Man-Thing was intended to be a prosthetic, CG-enhanced creature", Arad told The Continuum during a visit to Marvel Studios So there was a great deal of R&D.... There's positional stuff happening on location, on the set, but at the same time the stuff you don't currently see in camera was always engineered to be enhanced by digital effects. So when you see the movie, hopefully the line is pretty blurry. It's not an all-CG creature.<ref name=schroeder2006 />

===Design===
Special effects makeup was by the Make-Up Effects Group of [[Australia]].<ref name=schroeder2006 />
The Man-Thing was built as a full-size creature suit, performed by [[Conan Stevens|Mark Stevens]], a 7'1" (216&nbsp;cm) [[Australian people|Australian]] actor, ex-wrestler and stuntman.<ref name=schroeder2006 />

Although no full-digital Man-Thing model was made due to budgetary constraints, the suit was combined with digital moving branches and tendrils for certain sequences, also well as digital augmentation for the eyes.<ref name=schroeder2006 />

==Music==
The band AzUR (DOG Productions' Wayne and Luke, joined with Bec And Freddie) recorded the song The ''Man-Thing Lives Again'' that played over the end credits of the film. It was supposed to be released as a promotional video, but since the film was in a constant state of flux (financial, script, etc...) and was not going to go to theatres (as intended), the music video was pulled for lack of budget. Marvel did not want to leak advance images of the set and creature costume before the film's eventual release.One of the band members has worked on the footage and uploaded a remix on [[YouTube]].<ref name=schroeder2006 />

The US release date was set for [[Halloween]] (October 31) 2004,<ref name=schroeder2006 /> but when [[Marvel Enterprises]] released its second quarter financial report, ''Man-Thing'' was included in the 2005 line-up with a release date to be decided. Reportedly, the film was so bad that the test audience walked out before it was finished. So, Marvel put it back on video in the United States, since it would not be bankable in a domestic release. The film was released it internationally in places like [[Russia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]].
