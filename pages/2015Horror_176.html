==Synopsis==
Angela (Sarah Smyth) used to work at a doctor's office that was shut down after its doctor was shot to death by anti-abortion protester Abraham Baarker (James Wilson), who was arrested soon after. Undeterred, Angela decides to open a home clinic where she provides basic services – something that puts her at odds with the rest of the Baarker family, who believes that she is performing abortions. They also believe that she's to blame for recent infant deaths (implied to be due to water pollution), which they see as a sign of God's disapproval. Things are made more tense when Angela helps the wife ([[Jewel Staite]]) of one of the Baarkers flee an abusive marriage.
