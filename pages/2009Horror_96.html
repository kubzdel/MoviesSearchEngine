'''''The Haunting in Connecticut''''' is a 2009 American [[psychological horror]] film produced by [[Gold Circle Films]] and directed by [[Peter Cornwell (director)|Peter Cornwell]]. The film is alleged to be about Carmen Snedeker and her family, though [[Ray Garton]], author of ''In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting'' (1992), has publicly distanced himself from the accuracy of the events he depicted in the book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/11/08/10/ |title=Episode Notes for A Connecticut Haunting in a Keen Author’s Court |date=August 10, 2011 |work=[[MonsterTalk]] |publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic]] |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.damnedct.com/damned-interview-ray-garton |title=Damned Interview: Ray Garton |last=Bendici |first=Ray |work=Damned Connecticut |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref> The film's story follows the fictional Campbells as they move into a house (a former [[mortuary]]) to mitigate the strains of travel on their cancer-stricken son, Matthew. The family soon becomes haunted by violent and traumatic events from supernatural forces occupying the house.

Although the film was moderately successful at the box office, grossing $77,527,732,<ref name="mojo" /> it received "generally unfavorable reviews" according to [[Metacritic]].<ref name="meta" /> In 2010 Gold Circle Films announced the production of two more entries in the franchise, ''[[The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia]]'' (released 2013) and ''The Amityville Murders: A Haunting on Long Island''. They noted, however, that neither film would be a direct sequel to ''The Haunting in Connecticut'' and would instead be self-contained films with unique characters.<ref name="variety.com">{{cite web|last=Siegel |first=Tatiana |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020512.html?categoryId=13&cs=1 |title=Gold stays ghoul with third 'Haunting' |work=Variety |date=June 11, 2010 |accessdate=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
In 1987, Sara Campbell ([[Virginia Madsen]]) is driving her son Matthew ([[Kyle Gallner]]) home from the hospital where he has been undergoing cancer treatments. Sara and her husband Peter ([[Martin Donovan]]), a recovering alcoholic, discuss finding a rental house closer to the hospital. On another hospital visit, Sara finds a man putting up a “For Rent” sign in front of a large house. The man is frustrated and offers her the first month free if she will rent it immediately.

The following day, Peter arrives with Matt's brother Billy ([[Ty Wood]]) and cousins Wendy ([[Amanda Crew]]) and Mary, and they choose rooms. Matt chooses the basement, where there is a mysterious door. After moving in, Matt suffers a series of visions involving an old, bearded man and corpses with symbols carved into their skin. The next day, Peter learns that the house was supposedly a [[funeral home]]; the room behind the mysterious door is a mortuary.

Matt tells another patient, Reverend Nicholas Popescu ([[Elias Koteas]]), about the visions. Nicholas advises him to find out what the spirit wants. Later, Matt finds a burned figure in his room who begins to move toward him. When the family comes home, they find a shirtless Matt with his fingers blood-covered from scratching at the wall.

The family begins to crack under the stress of Matt's illness and bizarre behavior. The children find a box of photographs, which show Jonah, a young man from Matt's visions, at a [[séance]], emitting [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]. Wendy and Matt find out that the funeral home was run by a man named Ramsey Aickman. Aickman also conducted psychic research and would host séances with Jonah as the [[Mediumship|medium]]. At one séance, all those attending, including Aickman, were found dead and Jonah disappeared.

Nicholas theorizes that Aickman was practicing [[necromancy]] in an attempt to control the dead and bind them to the house. That night, Nicholas finds human remains in the house and removes them. Matt awakens to find Aickman’s symbols carved into his flesh. He is taken to the hospital, where he encounters Jonah. Nicholas and Matt begin to have simultaneous visions. Everyone in the séance is burnt, after a flash of bright light. The barely alive Aickman told Jonah to get out of the house, concerned that the demonic presence will get him next. Jonah uses a dumbwaiter to escape, calling for help. Entering an unknown chamber, Jonah realizes that he has entered the [[crematory]]. The spirit traps Jonah in the crematory, and [[cremation|cremates]] him alive.

Peter and Sara learn that Matt's cancer treatments have had no effect. They then discover that Matt has escaped the hospital. Back at the house, Nicholas leaves a message telling the family to get out of the house immediately – Jonah's spirit was actually protecting them from the spirits. Matt breaks through the walls in the front room with an axe, revealing the dusty corpses Aickman hid in the walls. He forces Wendy and the children to get out, barricading himself inside and tearing down the other walls, as corpses begin to tumble into the room. The view switches from Matt to Jonah, who seems to be occupying Matt's body. Matt lights the bodies and the room on fire. Later on investigators arrive to the house to only find it engulfed in flames.  

As the fire department arrives, Sara and Peter frantically try to get in to save Matt. The spirits, finally freed, disappear. Outside, everyone watches tearfully as the emergency crew attempts to resuscitate a dying Matt. As Matt slips away, he has a vision of himself standing in the graveyard where he sees Jonah, no longer appearing burnt. He seems about to follow Jonah when he hears his mother’s voice.

He returns to his body and Jonah's spirit leaves him. Matt's cancer disappears, and the house was rebuilt and resold with no further reported incidents of haunting.

==True story==
Promotional material for the film claimed that it was "based on true events" experienced by the Snedeker family of [[Southington, Connecticut]] in 1986. [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]] claimed that the Snedeker house was a former funeral home where morticians committed [[necromancy]] and/or [[necrophilia]] with the corpses, and that there were "powerful" supernatural "forces at work" that were cured by an [[exorcism]].<ref name="reel">{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/around-town/archive/A-Connecticut-Haunting-The-Real-Deal-.html|title=A Connecticut Haunting: The Reel Deal|work=NBC Connecticut|date=March 11, 2009|author=Reyes, Kyle|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|year=2008|title=Ghost Hunters of New England|page=7|author=Brown, Alan|isbn=978-1-58465-720-0|publisher=UPNE}}</ref> 
Carmen Snedeker's claims of haunting by an "evil entity" and subsequent [[exorcism]] were dramatized in episodes of the television series ''[[A Haunting]]'', ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'' and ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]''.<ref>{{cite episode | title=Connecticut Haunting | episode-link=Mysteries at the Museum#Season_7_(2014) | url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/video/connecticut-haunting | access-date=September 3, 2016 | series=[[Mysteries at the Museum]] | series-link= | first= | last= | network=[[Travel Channel]] | station= | date=September 12, 2014 | season=7 | series-number= | number=1 | minutes= | time= | transcript= | transcript-url= | language= | format= | lay-url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/episodes/brassiere-brigade-flight-for-life-connecticut-haunting}}</ref>

However, according to skeptical investigator [[Benjamin Radford]], there is "little or no proof that anything supernatural occurred at the house". Radford wrote that author [[Ray Garton]] was employed by the Warrens to write the supposedly "true story" and was instructed by Ed Warren, "You've got some of the story — just use what works and make the rest up… Just make it up and make it scary."<ref name=livescience.com>{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Benjamin|title=The Real Story Behind 'The Haunting in Connecticut'|url=http://www.livescience.com/5346-real-story-haunting-connecticut.html|website=livescience.com|publisher=livescience.com|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Researcher [[Joe Nickell]] has dismissed the story as a [[hoax]]. Nickell noted that since Ed Warren died in 2006, some of his coauthors have admitted he "told them to make up incidents and details to create scary stories."<ref>Nickell, Joe.
