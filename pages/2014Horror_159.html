'''''The Purge: Anarchy''''' is a 2014 American [[utopian and dystopian fiction|dystopian]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[James DeMonaco]]. The film stars [[Frank Grillo]], [[Carmen Ejogo]], [[Zach Gilford]], [[Kiele Sanchez]], [[Zoë Soul]], and [[Michael K. Williams]]. [[Edwin Hodge]] reprised his role from the first film. It was released worldwide on July 18, 2014. It is the [[sequel]] to 2013's ''[[The Purge]]'' and is the second installment in [[The Purge (franchise)|''The Purge'' franchise]].

The film grossed over $111&nbsp;million and received mixed reviews from critics. While the first film was set entirely in one house, ''Anarchy'' takes place around the greater [[Los Angeles area]] and shows more of what happens to the surroundings during the Purge. A third film in the series, ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'', was released on July 1, 2016.

==Plot==
On March 21, 2023, the media credits the annual Purge, a 12-hour period wherein all crimes are legal without authorities intervening, as an economic success. Everywhere, people either prepare to barricade themselves indoors or commit acts of violence. The nation's impoverished population is no longer seen as people, but as living garbage, whom the wealthy denounce as only living to serve their needs. However, before the sixth annual purge begins, a successful anti-purge [[Resistance movement|resistance group]] led by Carmelo Johns and his partner, the Stranger from the [[The Purge|first film]] – revealed as "Dwayne" – hijack government feeds to denounce the New Founding Fathers and their actions.

In [[Los Angeles]], working-class [[waitress]] Eva Sanchez returns home to her 17 year old daughter Cali and terminally ill father Rico, who also despises the New Founding Fathers. As Eva and Cali prepare to barricade themselves into their apartment, Rico retires to his room to be alone as the Purge starts.  As the Purge alarm sounds, Rico slips out to a waiting [[limousine]], leaving a note for his family revealing that he has sold himself as a Purge offering in exchange for $100,000 to be paid to Eva and Cali after the Purge. Eva and Cali are distraught by this situation. 

Married couple Shane and Liz visit a grocery store, only to be ambushed by a masked gang of bikers. As they drive away to avoid them, their car breaks down, as the biker gang had cut their fuel line. Meanwhile, an off-duty [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant, Leo Barnes, plots to kill a man who had inadvertently run down and killed his son while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]] not during the Purge, and was acquitted on legal technicalities. Barnes drives out into the streets heavily armed, posing as a [[vigilante]].

As Shane and Liz try to find safer hiding places, the purge commences. Eva and Cali are attacked by their lustful [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] Diego, who felt insulted in the past by Eva, but he is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, which captures the women to offer them to their leader Big Daddy for his own personal purge. The sergeant rescues them after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. They find Shane and Liz hiding in the sergeant's car. The group flees just as Big Daddy fires at them, damaging the car. As the sergeant's car breaks down, the group flees on foot to reach the home of Eva's co-worker Tanya, and borrow her car. As they navigate the hostile streets, they find evidence that the anti-Purge group has been gaining the upper hand against the Purgers, discovering a paramilitary van surrounded by soldiers who were shot to death by the resistance fighters. After freeing Shane from a trap and taking guns from the abandoned van, they head to the subways. A [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] Purging gang invades the subways and sets hiding people on fire, causing chaos. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's [[all-terrain vehicle]] and its [[propane]] tank with the salvaged [[submachine guns]], killing the entire gang.

After running for their lives, Eva unknowingly signals a [[traffic camera]] to identify them to the NFFA troops who pick up the location of Tanya's apartment building. The group reaches Tanya's house, but learns no car is there. Tanya's family takes them in, offering dinner and medicine. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine proceeds to murder her sister for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family to their fate, only to be captured by the masked gang, who reveal that they had no intention to kill them and are selling them off to an auction, taking them to a theater where upper-class Purgers bid them for [[human hunting]]. After the gang is forced into the arena, the sergeant subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and [[night vision device|night-vision glasses]], using the devices to overpower and kill several other attackers, providing their arms to Shane and the others before the head Purger, Janice, calls in security to suppress the uprising; Shane is shot and killed by security forces. The anti-Purge group attacks the compound, killing the security forces and remaining Purgers; Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters to retaliate against Shane's murderers, while the sergeant, Eva and Cali leave; the sergeant [[carjacking|carjacks]] Janice, holding her at gunpoint and denouncing her before leaving in her car.

The sergeant, Eva, and Cali drive up to a suburban neighborhood, and stop at the home of Warren Grass. He reveals that Grass killed his son while [[drunk driving|driving under the influence]], but was acquitted. He ventures into the house, threatening Warren and his wife. The next scene shows the sergeant exiting the house covered in blood, only to be shot by Big Daddy, who reveals that the New Founding Fathers have secretly dispatched [[death squad]]s to increase the body count because the purge eliminates too few of the lower class, possibly due to purgers murdering those they have personal grudges against and not just random people. Just as he is about to kill the sergeant, Warren appears and shoots Big Daddy with a pistol, killing him, revealing that the sergeant chose to spare him. As Big Daddy's death squad appears, sirens blare to signal the end of the purge (making Big Daddy's death legal and sparing sergeant). Warren drives Eva, Cali, and the sergeant to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city.
