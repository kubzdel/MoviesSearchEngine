'''''Resident Evil: Extinction''''' is a 2007 [[Horror film#Subgenres|action horror]]<ref name="Worldwide"/> film and the third installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]] based on the [[Capcom]] [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Resident Evil]]''. The film follows the heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], along with a group of survivors from [[Raccoon City]], as they attempt to travel across the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave desert]] wilderness to [[Alaska]] and escape a [[zombie apocalypse]].<ref name="Production Notes">{{cite web | author=| year=Fall 2007| title=Resident Evil: Extinction Production Notes| work=sonypictures.com | url = http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilextinction/site/download.php?file=library/ResidentEvilExtinction_ProductionNotes.pdf | accessdate = 2007-12-20}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Russell Mulcahy]] and produced by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]].

The film received mostly negative reviews. It was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in North America on January 1, 2008.

This film was initially titled ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' according to the leaked script.<ref>[http://www.mediafire.com/?s4cczdp81pzruvd Resident Evil: Extinction script] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130128084038/http://www.mediafire.com/?s4cczdp81pzruvd |date=2013-01-28 }}</ref> For unknown reasons, it was renamed to ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. The title ''Afterlife'' was used for the [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|fourth installment]] of the series.

==Plot==
Alice ([[Milla Jovovich]]) wakes up disoriented in a mansion. Wandering through its halls, she is forced to escape several [[Booby trap|security traps]]. However, she is eventually killed by a [[bounding mine]] hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be one of many clones being produced inside of an underground facility whose entrance above ground is surrounded by thousands of zombies.

Despite the best efforts of the bio-tech company [[Umbrella Corporation]] to cover up the [[Resident Evil (film)|contamination of The Hive]] and the release of the T-virus to the surface, going so far as to authorize the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|bombing of Raccoon City]], the T-virus has spread around the world. As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in [[Alaska]].  She later begins to realize that she has developed [[telekinesis|telekinetic abilities]] due to the experiments performed on her.

Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs ([[Iain Glen]]), former head of Project Alice and the head of the North American Umbrella facility seen earlier (based in [[Nevada]]), considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman [[Albert Wesker]] ([[Jason O'Mara]]) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.

Meanwhile, a convoy of survivors led by [[Claire Redfield]] ([[Ali Larter]]) travels across the country in search of supplies. The convoy includes Raccoon City survivors [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]] ([[Oded Fehr]]) and L.J. ([[Mike Epps]]), along with new survivors [[List of Resident Evil film characters#K-Mart|K-Mart]] ([[Spencer Locke]]), Mikey ([[Chris Egan (actor)|Christopher Egan]]), Chase ([[Linden Ashby]]), Otto ([[Joe Hursley]]) and Nurse Betty ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti Douglas]]), among others.

While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is bitten by a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is attacked by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.

Dr. Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater ([[Matthew Marsden]]), is adamant about Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella's regulations. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs' actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.

Umbrella triangulates Alice's location based on the signal sent out by her telekinetic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Mikey and Chase, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground location.

The convoy heads over to the site, which is surrounded by thousands of zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing the rig apart, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives with a group of commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering a mutation that transforms Isaacs into a monstrous [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|creature]]. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.

Entering the facility, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queen's "sister" [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], the White Queen ([[Madeline Carroll]]). The White Queen informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus, while also defending the Red Queen's prior actions. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but appears to die from shock shortly after. Alice soon discovers a replica of the [[Resident Evil (film)|Racoon City mansion]] deep within the complex and finds Isaacs.  The two engage in a fight, eventually leading them to a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, where Isaacs is killed by the laser-defense system. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, whom is revealed to still be alive.

Later, in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], Wesker, who is the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen (all holograms) that the North American facility has been lost. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and she's bringing some of her "friends." Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto a huge number of pods containing numerous developing clones.

===Story development===
The film's story takes place in Death Valley, where the large scale action sequences take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from [[Spaghetti Western|western films]] and [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic movies]], including the [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' series]], ''Extinction'' manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around the [[Peak oil|shortage of oil]], the shortage of supplies, a [[Mad Max 2|convoy traveling across a desert]], and the desert taking over civilized land.<ref name="Production Notes"/>

Anderson stated that the film's story is original and unfolds in a world that fans of the game recognize: "It's all part of trying to deliver a movie-going experience that satisfies the fans of the game but also provides a fun cinematic experience for a broader audience that has never played a ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game."<ref name="Production Notes"/> The story takes place five years after the events of ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''. While previous installments in the series had minor changes to plot and characters, ''Extinction'' branches completely away from the video game series as evidenced by the fact that ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' takes place six years after the events portrayed in ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and the world has not become overrun with zombies. References to ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code Veronica]]'' are made, such as the replica mansion and the viral outbreak itself.<ref name="Production Notes"/> A common element used throughout each ''Resident Evil'' film is the climactic battle which occurs in the finale.<ref name="Production Notes"/> ''Extinction'' marked the first appearance of herbs, a healing item in the video game series, as seen in Dr. Isaac's lab,<ref name="Production Notes"/> and it also referenced the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]] with the inclusion of a replica [[The Hive (Resident Evil)|Hive facility]] designed after the one in [[Raccoon City]], the Raccoon City Hospital, a holographic computer database known as the White Queen, and the replica [[Arklay Research Facility|Spencer Mansion]].<ref name="Production Notes"/>

Numerous references to the video game series have been made, including zombies being unleashed through a T-virus mutation. While the concept of the undead remains the same, this film includes "Super Undead". As Anderson explains, these are "a result of Umbrella experimenting with the Undead and attempting to give them back some of their reasoning power, some of their intelligence and a little of their humanity. Unfortunately, these experiments don't quite work and the side effect is the Super Undead, which are Undead that are faster, stronger and [a] more cunning foe."<ref name="Production Notes"/> Other creatures from the video game series have also made appearances in the film, including the [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]], a swarm of crows, and a pack of [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]]s (although [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|Belgian Shepherd Dog]]s were used during production).<ref name="Production Notes"/>

Two main characters were added to the film's cast: [[Albert Wesker]] (portrayed by [[Jason O'Mara]]) and [[Claire Redfield]] (portrayed by [[Ali Larter]]) from ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''.<ref name="Production Notes"/>

Horror magazine ''[[Fangoria]]'' featured the film in its August 2007 issue and also on the cover of its September 2007 issue, talking with director Russell Mulcahy. The following details reported were inaccurate, possibly indicating to a change in the storyline:
* Alice's convoy are traveling across the Nevada desert trying to reach sanctuary in [[Alaska]] to meet [[Chris Redfield]] and other survivors. In the film, however, there is no mention of Chris, and the convoy is headed by Claire.
* The film would feature new "super zombies" that had been "pumped up on some sort of alter-essence steroids". The final "super zombies" are created using blood taken from clones of Alice.
* Mulcahy stated concerning the (what was then considered to be) ending of the film trilogy, "As far as I'm aware, this is indeed supposed to close the book."
* ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' takes place eight years after ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. In the film, this was contradicted when characters stated that it had been five years since the outbreak.
* The character of Claire Redfield did not exist in the early draft scripts for the film and previously [[Jill Valentine]] (who appeared in ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]'' played by [[Sienna Guillory]]) would continue the role in ''Resident Evil: Extinction''. Later, producers Paul W. S. Anderson and Jeremy Bolt decided to have a separate game character appear alongside Alice, saying, "We thought, rather than bring Jill back, put her with another game heroine."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Waddell |first= Calum |title= Resident Evil: Extinction, Hot Blood in the Sun|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last=Turek| first= Ryan| title=Resident Evil: Extinction Daylight of the Dead| publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=September 2007}}</ref>

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''Extinction'' was negatively received by critics upon release. The film received a [[Rotten Tomatoes]] score of 22% based on 94 reviews<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|resident_evil_extinction}} [[Flixster]]</ref> and Metacritic gave it a "Mixed or average" score of 41 out of 100.<ref>{{Metacritic film|http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil-extinction}}</ref>

Steven Hyden of ''[[The Onion]]''′s [[The A.V. Club|A.V. Club]] said that "the movie delivers some simple-minded thrills" and praised the "solidly effective killer-ravens sequence" but felt the film was too predictable, saying: "Anybody who has ever seen a zombie movie can figure out what happens next. Somebody will get bit without telling the others, which will inevitably backfire. Survivors will be forced to shoot suddenly undead friends in the head. One of them dastardly science folk will protect the monsters in order to study them, which will also inevitably backfire. And legions of undead will be re-killed in surprisingly easy fashion."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/cinema/resident_evil_extinction | title = Resident Evil: Extinction review | first = Steven | last = Hyden | work = [[The A.V. Club]] | publisher = [[The Onion]] | date = September 24, 2007 }}</ref>

Kevin Crust of the [[The Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times'']] praised the film, saying that "the story and characters are surprisingly engaging, with fight scenes and scares effectively placed between plot turns" although he felt that the ending was too "open-ended".<ref>''Resident Evil'': Extinction'' Review|http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/24/entertainment/et-resident24</ref>
[[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave ''Extinction'' half a star out of a possible four, saying that the film was "no more interesting than watching someone else play with his [[PlayStation|Playstation]]".<ref name="Smith">{{cite news | title=Flicked-off video| newspaper=New York Post| url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09222007/entertainment/movies/flicked_off_video.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-09 | first=Kyle | last=Smith | date=2007-09-22}}</ref>
Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that ''Extinction'' "plays like a flabby middle chapter, full of nerdy details but fraudulently short on the ruined Vegas-scape that ads have been promising."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20058691,00.html |title=EW review |accessdate=2008-01-09 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2007-09-26}}</ref> Jack Mathews of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' gave the film a score of one and a half stars out of five, calling the action scenes "monotonous" and urging audiences to "flee this yawn of the dead."<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/22/2007-09-22_resident_evil_extinction_flee_this_yawn_-1.html Resident Evil: Extinction review], Jack Mathews, New York Daily News</ref>
Helen O'Hara of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave ''Extinction'' a score of 4 out of five, saying that the film was "better than ''[[Resident Evil: Apocalypse]]''" and had "an effectively creepy empty world setting"."<ref>[http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=133903 Resident Evil: Extinction review], Helen O'Hara, Empire</ref>

Frank Scheck says that as the film is "fast-paced and filled with brisk action sequences", it should "reasonably satisify the devotees."<ref>''Resident Evil: Extinction'' Review|http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/resident-evil-extinction-158006</ref> [[Maitland McDonagh]] of ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a score of two and a half stars out of four, saying: "Equal parts ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'', [''Extinction''] is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip."<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/resident-evil-extinction/review/290237 Resident Evil: Extinction review], Maitland McDonagh, TV Guide</ref> Pete Vonder Haar of [[Film Threat]] gave ''Extinction'' a score of three out of five, saying that the film had "rather lazy pacing" but added that "the way Anderson keeps upping the ante with regard to Alice's ultimate fate continues to amuse."<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&Id=10300 Resident Evil: Extinction review], Pete Vonder Haar, Film Threat, September 23, 2007</ref>
