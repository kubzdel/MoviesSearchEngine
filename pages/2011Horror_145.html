'''''The Roommate'''''  is a 2011 American [[psychological thriller]] directed by [[Christian E. Christiansen]] and starring [[Minka Kelly]], [[Leighton Meester]], [[Cam Gigandet]], [[Danneel Harris]], [[Matt Lanter]], and [[Aly Michalka]]. It was theatrically released on February 4, 2011. The film is inspired by the 1992 film ''[[Single White Female]]''.

==Plot==
Sara Matthews ([[Minka Kelly]]) is starting her freshman year of college. She meets Tracy ([[Aly Michalka]]), Stephen ([[Cam Gigandet]]) – her love interest, and Rebecca ([[Leighton Meester]]) – her college roommate. The girls begin to bond and Rebecca learns that Sara had an older sister, Emily, who died when Sara was nine, and an ex-boyfriend, Jason ([[Matt Lanter]]), who keeps calling her in attempts to reconcile. As time goes on, Rebecca's obsession with Sara grows, which causes her to drive away anyone who could come between them.

Rebecca attacks Tracy in the shower, pinning her down and ripping out her belly-button ring, and says that she is a bad influence on Sara and threatens to kill Tracy unless she stays away from Sara. Tracy moves to another dorm, fearful of Rebecca. An old friend of Sara's named Irene ([[Danneel Harris]]), who is a lesbian, invites Sara to move in with her when Sara's cat Cuddles is discovered. Rebecca then kills Cuddles by putting her in the dryer and lies to Sara that the cat ran away. Rebecca then inflicts injuries upon herself and says she was assaulted by a thug. Sara feels bad for her and decides to spend the Thanksgiving with Rebecca. When Sara's philandering fashion design professor, Roberts ([[Billy Zane]]), kisses her, Rebecca plans to get the professor out of the picture by seducing him while recording their dialogue on a tape recorder to make it sound like he was trying to rape her.

During her stay, Sara overhears a conversation between Rebecca and her father ([[Tomas Arana]]), hinting Rebecca has had trouble making friends in the past. Rebecca's mother ([[Frances Fisher]]) mentions that Rebecca is supposed to be taking medication. She and Stephen later find a bottle of [[Olanzapine|Zyprexa]] pills, used to treat [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. The bottle is full, implying that Rebecca has not been taking the pills. Sara, worried about what would happen, decides to move in with Irene. Irene goes to a club where she sees Rebecca. They kiss passionately in the club's bathroom and Irene, not knowing that Rebecca is Sara's roommate, takes Rebecca back to her place. The following morning, Sara goes to Irene's apartment but she is not there.

Rebecca gets Sara's sister's name tattooed in the same place on her breast as Sara, saying that Sara can now think of Rebecca as her sister. A shocked Sara realizes that Rebecca is obsessed with her and packs all her things, except her sister's necklace, which she cannot find (the necklace had been stolen by Rebecca). Jason arrives at Sara's dorm and slips a note under her door, saying that he wants to see her. Rebecca reads the note, impersonates Sara with her sister's necklace and tattoo, and dyes her hair to look like Sara. She then goes to Jason's hotel room and stabs him to death.

Later, Sara gets a text from Irene, saying she needs her right away. When she gets there, she finds that Rebecca kidnapped Irene and is holding her captive, bound and gagged so she can't get free or call out for someone to save her. Rebecca reveals that she was responsible for what happened to Tracy, Cuddles, Professor Roberts, Irene, and Jason and that she did it all to win Sara's friendship. Rebecca wants to kill Irene, in order to finally have Sara all to herself. Rebecca reaches for the revolver but struggled with Sara who tried to stop her from shooting Irene.  The gun got free and Sara winded up outside the room while Sara quickly locked the door.  Sara tried to get out the window to get help meanwhile Rebecca tried to break down the door.  Rebecca finally shot the lock and broke into the room and nearly missed Sara with a shot.  Stephen suddenly showed up and tried to subdue Rebecca; however, in the ensuing struggle and enraged, Rebecca attacks Sara and tries to strangle her, but Sara stabs Rebecca in the back with a box cutter, killing her. Irene was still tied up but was eventually untied by Sara. Sara moves back into her dorm and moves the extra bed out of her room with the help of Stephen, proclaiming that she does not want a roommate for a while.

==Reception==
''The Roommate'' was given negative reviews by critics. As of May 30, 2014, the film held a 4% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 84 reviews with a consensus of it being "Devoid of chills, thrills, or even cheap titillation, ''The Roommate'' isn't even bad enough to be good."<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|the_roommate}}</ref>  [[CinemaScore]] polls indicated a "B−" rating from audiences.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/02/box-office-roommate-beats-sanctum-on-slow-super-bowl-weekend.html|title=Box office: 'Roommate' beats 'Sanctum' on slow Super Bowl weekend [Updated]|last=Kaufman|first=Amy|last2=Fritz|first2=Ben|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=February 6, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}</ref>

Keith Staskiewicz of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a D, saying it "is really just a far-below-par thriller that desperately wishes it were a different movie&nbsp;– a longing it shares with the audience," but praises Meester for bringing "the slightest trace of something fascinating to her role. When she smiles, it's perfectly located between a sweet display of affection and a snarling warning."<ref>{{cite news|first=Keith|last=Staskiewicz|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20463974,00.html|title=''The Roommate'' Review|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave it a half star, stating that "''The Roommate''&nbsp;– the umpteenth uncredited remake of 1992's ''[[Single White Female]]''&nbsp;– sucks bad, real bad" and that "Danish director Christian E. Christiansen has no flair for suspense".<ref>{{cite web |first=Peter|last=Travers|authorlink=Peter Travers|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-roommate-20110204/ |title=The Roommate |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=San Francisco, California|date=February 4, 2011 |access-date=November 16, 2017}}</ref> Meester's performance garnered praise from other top critics, including the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', which states: "Here her performance often has the feeling of a sports car in neutral. When she punches it for quick changes of tone from manic to wounded or around the bend, she shows how much more she is capable of."<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Olsen|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-roommate-20110205,0,3499973.story|title=Movie review: 'The Roommate'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Some of the promotional posters and displays for the film used the Christy Administration Building from [[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]] as its backdrop. The college administration voiced concern that permission to use the photograph of the building was not properly obtained and investigated the legality of its use.<ref>{{Cite web|first = Allen|last = Twitchell|url = http://www.winfieldcourier.com/articles/2010/12/03/news/news/doc4cf932cdb33af858348853.txt|title = Image of SC building on movie poster|work = [[The Winfield Daily Courier]]|publisher=Winfield Publishing Company|location=Winfield, Kansas|date = December 3, 2010|accessdate = January 17, 2011}}</ref>

Primary concerns hinged that the image of the college (particularly the image of the building) could be damaged, while other concerns were that the college's primary iconic image was being used for promotion of an unrelated business venture.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://scupdate.org/?p=5240|publisher=[[Southwestern College (Kansas)|Southwestern College]] Student Media|title = Christy photo on movie poster causes concern|first = Korie|last = Hawkins|date = December 9, 2010|accessdate = January 17, 2011}}</ref>

Though the film successfully earned $15.6 million in receipts to top the box office during its debut weekend in the United States, concerns continued. By that time, the image of the building had been replaced on the film's official website and on subsequent promotional material. The photo of the building reportedly was licensed from [[iStockPhoto]] based in [[Calgary, Alberta]]. As of February 8, 2011, no lawsuits had been filed but discussions had taken place.<ref>{{cite web|first=Allen|last=Twitchell|url=http://www.winfieldcourier.com/articles/2011/02/08/news/news/doc4d5183cc7aa41324106218.txt|title=Movie poster image remains a concern for SC administration|work=[[The Winfield Daily Courier]]|publisher=Winfield Publishing Company|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=February 10, 2011}}</ref>

Students at the school reported "mixed feelings" about the topic – some believed that it may have been helpful for the college and others reported that they saw how it could have been harmful to the school's image.<ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Andres|url=http://www.ksn.com/mostpopular/story/Southwestern-College-unhappy-with-national-movie/XvqmwuPHREOM_ZbKJZ7kgw.cspx|title=Southwestern College unhappy with national movie poster (with video)|publisher=[[KSNW|KSN TV 3]]|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=March 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211230733/http://www.ksn.com/mostpopular/story/Southwestern-College-unhappy-with-national-movie/XvqmwuPHREOM_ZbKJZ7kgw.cspx|archivedate=February 11, 2011|df=}}</ref>
