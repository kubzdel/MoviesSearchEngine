'''''George: A Zombie Intervention''''' (also '''''George's Intervention''''') is a 2009 American [[zombie comedy]] directed by [[J. T. Seaton]], written by Seaton and [[Brad Hodson]], and starring Carlos Larkin as a zombie who undergoes an intervention by his friends, who are concerned that he is eating humans.

== Plot ==
After spores cause the dead to rise as zombies, the undead become a natural and accepted part of society. However, George's friends become worried about his behavior after his transformation into a zombie. Convinced that he's been eating humans, they decide to stage an intervention, wherein they will attempt to convince him to attend a zombie rehab that teaches zombies how to control their appetite for human flesh. Sarah, George's ex-girlfriend, recruits a professional interventionist, Barbra, and she and several of George's friends stage a practice run before confronting him directly. George, however, sees nothing wrong with his behavior and resists their demands. As tempers flare, George finds his hunger increasingly difficult to control, and he begins to give in to his urges.
