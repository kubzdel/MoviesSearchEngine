==Plot==
For the past 33 years Jeremiah Hill ([[Roger Hewlett]]) has lived alone, with no contact with the outside world, and he intends to keep it that way. Jeremiah's mother ([[Tracy Scoggins]]) had always warned him not to associate with the outside world, and her brutal rape and killing right before his eyes taught him a lesson he intends never to forget; and those who enter his world will pay a deadly price. As Lehman ([[Mario Lopez]]) and his five friends from [[Los Angeles]] start their weekend camping trip they run into Tyler Trout ([[Gary Busey]]) and Floyd Fryed ([[Rance Howard]]) who represent the gateway into this distorted world that they are about to enter. These things just don't happen in the small mountain town of Sheriff Talmidge ([[Bo Hopkins]]) and Deputy Kevin Gordon ([[Stephen Saux]]). By stumbling upon this lonely cabin in the woods, the men have shattered 33 years of solitude in Jeremiah's world. Soon their weekend trip of [[hiking]] and [[camping]] will become a [[nightmare]] of [[wiktionary:survival|survival]].
