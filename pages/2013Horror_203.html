==Synopsis==
Jennifer ([[Jessica Cameron]]), Ray (Shelby Stehlin), Courtney (Devanny Pinn), Michelle ([[Heather Dorff]]), Tony (Brandon Van Vliet), and John (Jesse Wilson) are all members of a group named the "Truth or Dare-Devils". They're known for their outrageous [[YouTube]] videos where they take the party game [[Truth or Dare?]] to extreme levels, which eventually gains them significant media attention and a decent fan following. It's at one of their guest appearances that they have a confrontation with Derik (Ryan Kiser), an obsessed fan that is angry that they haven't responded to all of his e-mails. He's also upset that there are elements of the group's videos have been faked for dramatic effect and that scenes of gore and violence aren't real. The group ultimately dismisses Derik as just an over-the-top obsessed fan and head to John's home to rest, only to become horrified when they realize that Derik has followed them and is intent on making new Truth or Dare-Devils videos that are all too real.
