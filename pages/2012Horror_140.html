''''' Portrait of a Zombie''''' is a 2012 Irish [[horror film]] directed by [[Bing Bailey]] and written by Bailey and Laura Morand Bailey. It was released on March 3, 2012.  Patrick Murphy plays a young man whose family decides to accept him when he turns into a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]].

== Plot ==
During a zombie outbreak in Ireland, an American documentary film crew become interested in the story of a local Irish family who decide to keep their zombie-turned son a part of the family.  When the film crew arrives in Ireland, they discover that the family's decision has angered their neighbors and a local crime boss.  As tempers rise, the Americans document the controversy.

== Cast ==
* Todd Fletcher as American Filmmaker
* Patrick Murphy as Billy
* Geraldine McAlinden as Lizzy
* Rory Mullen as Danny
* Paul O'Bryan as Darren
* Sonya O'Donoghue as Louise

== Production ==
The film was originally more of a [[genre film]], but budget constraints meant that director Bing Bailey needed to turn it into a hybrid of [[mockumentary]] and genre film.  Bailey said that he wanted to "have his ''[[The Evil Dead|Evil Dead]]'' experience".<ref name=interview/>  Pre-production was done over the Internet, as Bailey was living in the United States at the time.  Shooting took place in October 2009, May 2010, and May 2011; the additional shoots were due to a revamp of the initial concept that involved abandoned man-on-the-street interviews.  Post-production took another 18 months.<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishfilmmakers.com/2012/03/bing-bailey-interview/|title=Portrait of a Zombie Interview|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=IrishFilmmakers.com|accessdate=2014-05-01}}</ref>
