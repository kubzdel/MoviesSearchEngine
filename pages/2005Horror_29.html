==Plot==
While living at her parents' mountain home, Emily (Degroat) is visited by her friend Angelica (Barovich), who invites her to a [[rave]] party in the woods. Her interracial parents, Leo (Richards) and Justine ([[Deborah Lacey|Lacey]]), let her attend, under the condition that she must return by midnight and call if she's going to be late.

Arriving early at the party, Angelica immediately attempts to acquire [[MDMA|ecstasy]] and suspects an attendee named Swan ([[Sage Stallone|Stallone]]) is carrying the drug. When asked about it, Swan informs the two girls that he doesn't have any ecstasy on him, but he has it in a nearby cabin, where his friends live. He invites Emily and Angelica to come to the cabin with him and meet his friends; the two agree. Unknown to the girls, Swan's friends are actually his father Chaos (Gage), a notorious and wanted criminal, and his father's gang, which consists of Chaos' girlfriend Daisy (Quann) and felon Frankie (Wozniak). Chaos had sent his son to the party in order to lure unsuspecting women.

Upon their arrival at the cabin, Emily and Angelica are quickly captured by the gang and taken to an abandoned part of the woods. The girls manage to escape from their captors and split up in an attempt to make it harder for Chaos and his gang to find them. Angelica is ultimately caught by Daisy and brought before Chaos, who cuts off one of her nipples and force-feeds it to her, making her vomit, before he stabs her to death, and then proceeds to [[Necrophilia|violate her corpse]]. Chaos and his group continue their pursuit of Emily, even as the sun sets. They briefly re-encounter her, but Emily manages to steal Daisy's knife in a struggle and stabs Swan in the genitals. Knowing his wound is fatal, Chaos suffocates his son and promises to murder Emily.

Meanwhile, Justine becomes nervous about Emily's whereabouts when she doesn't answer her phone and convinces Leo to call the police. However, Justine suspects that MacDunner (Medlock), the investigating officer, won't attempt to find her because he's a racist who can barely contain his contempt for them. Justine and Leo head into the woods to search for Angelica and Emily by themselves. While searching for Emily, the couple find Angelica's corpse. Chaos and Frankie finally recapture Emily and bind her with rope. In retaliation for his son's death, Chaos uses his knife to slash Emily between her anus and genitals, watching as she bleeds to death and lamenting that he left her in no condition to be raped like he did Angelica. With both girls dead, the gang prepares to leave the area, but Chaos' van fails to start up. Knowing that they'll be caught if they stay in the woods, Chaos and his gang leave the vehicle and look for a car to steal. Their van is then found by MacDunner and his partner Wilson (Barrows), who discover blood-stained clothes.

The gang decides to go to a nearby house, with the intent of stealing the owner's car, unaware that they have arrived at Emily's home. Leo lets Chaos and his group stay at the home, but notices that Daisy is wearing Emily's belt. Suspecting the group of being involved with Emily's disappearance, Leo calls the police, while Chaos and Frankie prepare to hot-wire his car and kill the couple. 

Chaos is confronted by a shotgun-wielding Leo, determined to find out what happened to his daughter. When Frankie arrives with a captured Justine, Chaos disarms Leo and takes the shotgun. Instead of shooting Leo and Justine, however, Chaos shoots Daisy when she tries to convince him to leave the house. In the ensuing confusion, the couple escape. Leo emerges with a chainsaw and slashes Frankie across the stomach, and proceeds to attack Chaos. In the ensuing struggle, Leo manages to get the shotgun back from Chaos and prepares to kill him. Before he can, MacDunner arrives and stupidly orders Leo to drop his weapon, and then shoots and kills Leo when he aims the shotgun at Chaos. Justine retaliates by shooting MacDunner in the back and Wilson is killed by Chaos, who then whirls around and shoots Justine in the stomach, paralyzing her. Chaos then walks up to a gasping, terrified Justine and shoots her in the head, as his laughter is heard over the closing credits.

==Critical response==
[[Image:LastHousePoster.jpg|thumb|right|The poster design for ''Chaos'' (above) was also very similar in design to ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' film poster.]]
''Chaos'' earned a 6% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=rotten>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10005402-chaos/ |title=''Chaos'' Tomatometer |accessdate=2007-03-12 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> The film's [[Metacritic]] rating is 1 out of 100, meaning “overwhelming dislike”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/chaos |title=''Chaos'' reviews |accessdate=2007-03-12 |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> making it one of the worst reviewed films on their site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movie Releases by Score|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/lowscores.shtml|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> 

Joshua Land of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote, "The reference point is obviously Wes Craven's ''Last House on the Left'', but ''Chaos'' lacks the audience-implicating boldness or howling political outrage of that landmark; where ''Last House'' was provocative, ''Chaos'' is merely disgusting."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-08-02/film/chaos| title='Chaos' Review'|accessdate=2011-05-15|author=Land, Joshua|publisher= Village Voice}}</ref>

Conversely, the sole positive review for both Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's listings came from Ken Fox of ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Movie Guide, who gave it 2½ out of 4 stars and said, "Unlike so many other ''Last House on the Left'' rip-offs, this virtual remake is reasonably well shot and convincingly acted."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/detail/movie.aspx?tvobjectid=191927&more=ucmoviereview |title=Review of ''Chaos'' |accessdate=2007-03-12 |author=Fox, Ken|publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref>

===Roger Ebert===
''Chaos'' received some publicity from [[Roger Ebert]]'s zero star review and the filmmaker's response. Ebert wrote in his initial review that "''Chaos'' is ugly, nihilistic, and cruel – a film I regret having seen. I urge you to avoid it. Don't make the mistake of thinking it's 'only' a horror film, or a slasher film. It is an exercise in heartless cruelty and it ends with careless brutality."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/REVIEWS/508110303/1023 |title=Review of ''Chaos'' |accessdate=2007-03-12 |author=Ebert, Roger |date=2005-08-12 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}</ref>

DeFalco responded with a full page letter in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', saying in part, "Mr. Ebert, how do you want 21st century evil to be portrayed in film and in the media? Tame and sanitized? Titillating and exploitive? Or do you want evil portrayed as it really is? 'Ugly, nihilistic and cruel', as you say our film does it?"<ref name="Evil">{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050818/COMMENTARY/508190304 |title=Evil in film: To what end? |accessdate=2007-03-12 |author=Ebert, Roger|date=2005-08-19 |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}</ref>

Ebert replied to DeFalco in the article "Evil in film: To what end?", with "In a time of dismay and dread, is it admirable for filmmakers to depict pure evil? Have [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], suicide bombers, serial killers and kidnappings created a world in which the response of the artist must be nihilistic and hopeless? At the end of your film, after the other characters have been killed in sadistic and gruesome ways, the only survivor is the one who is evil incarnate, and we hear his cold laughter under a screen that has gone dark. [...] Your answer, that the world is evil and therefore it is your responsibility to reflect it, is no answer at all, but a surrender." Ebert also argued that, "Your real purpose in making ''Chaos'', I suspect, was not to educate, but to create a scandal that would draw an audience. There's always money to be made by going further and being more shocking. Sometimes there is also art to be found in that direction, but not this time."<ref name="Evil"/>
