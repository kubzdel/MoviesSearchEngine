'''''Life Blood''''' is a supernatural horror thriller film released in 2009. The film was directed and produced by Ron Carlson.<ref name="Life Blood">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2032412/Life-Blood/|title=Life Blood|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref>

==Plot==
On [[New Year's Eve]] 1968, a lesbian couple, named Brooke and Rhea, encounter the Creator of the Universe while driving on the [[California State Route 138|Pearblossom Highway]] as they leave a party, when Brooke killed a rapist. The women are laid to rest for 40 years and awake New Year's Day 2009... as vampires. The film follows them as they are meant to lead a life of greater purpose.

Instructed to devour evil, and thereby gain eternal life, the story portrays their first 24 hours of survival as these reborn creatures. Brooke starts to go on a killing [[spree]], to prove herself loyal to the Creator, while Rhea tries to put a stop to the chaos that Brooke started after she kills a sheriff, his deputies, a married couple on vacation, and a hitch-hiker.

The film ends with Rhea killing Brooke by impaling her with a stop sign, when Brooke refused to devour evil souls but to devour good souls. After telling her story to Lizzy, Rhea tries to start her life all over again, this time, as a vampire, not knowing that Brooke is still alive, presumably plotting her revenge.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34308/teaser-trailer-and-art-pearblossom Teaser Trailer and Art for Pearblossom]</ref>
