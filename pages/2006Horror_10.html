== Reception ==
[[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that film is too unfocused and should have been set solely in the Old West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/110349/after-sundown-v-2/?tab=overview|title=After Sundown (V)|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2006-12-01|accessdate=2015-02-25}}</ref>  Jon Condit of [[Dread Central]] rated it 1/5 stars and wrote that the plot holes ruin the film despite the attempts by the cast to take the film seriously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4276/after-sundown-dvd/|title=After Sundown (DVD)|last=Condit|first=Jon|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2006-07-23|accessdate=2015-02-25}}</ref>  Ian Jane of [[DVD Talk]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "In short, the filmmakers show potential and are obviously an ambitious lot â€“ they just didn't have either the means or the experience to pull it off this time."<ref name=dvdtalk/> Mac McEntire of [[DVD Verdict]] wrote, "''After Sundown'' promises low budget cowboy vampire zombie action, and that's just what it delivers. I doubt it'll ever be considered a horror classic, but fans of the genre could do a lot worse."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/aftersundown.php|title=After Sundown|last=McEntire|first=Mac|work=[[DVD Verdict]]|date=2006-09-15|accessdate=2015-02-25}}</ref>
