'''''The Windmill Massacre''''', known as '''''The Windmill''''' in the US, is a 2016 English-language Dutch [[slasher film]] directed by Nick Jongerius.  [[Charlotte Beaumont]] stars as an Australian fugitive in the Netherlands who joins a tour group to escape extradition.  After their bus breaks down by a windmill reputed to be haunted by an avenging demon, the tourists begin mysteriously dying.  It premiered at the [[London FrightFest Film Festival]] in August 2016 and received a limited theatrical release in the US in October.

== Plot ==
After fleeing Australia, Jennifer takes a job as a nanny in the Netherlands.  Her employer eventually discovers her true identity and that she is a fugitive.  Looking for a way to quickly leave Amsterdam, she attempts to bluff her way onto a tour bus.  Abe, the driver, allows her to board without a ticket, joking that "there's always room for another sinner".  The other tourists include the British businessman Douglas and his son, Curt; Jackson, a British soldier who accidentally killed a prostitute prior to boarding; Ruby, a French photographer sent to take pictures of windmills; Takashi, a university student who speaks only Japanese; and Nicholas, a troubled British physician.

Takashi recognizes Ruby as a promotional model who starred in a popular Japanese advertising campaign.  Responding to him in Japanese, Ruby downplays her fame and asks him not to cause a scene.  Jennifer drops a pill bottle, and Nicholas hands it back to her after examining the label.  After seeing her dead father standing in the road, Jennifer claims the bus has struck a man.  The other passengers become annoyed when she insists on checking, and the situation only worsens when Abe can not restart the bus.  Abe suggests they wait for help to arrive, but Jackson and Jennifer leave to investigate a nearby windmill.  After having flashbacks of killing the prostitute, Jackson is suddenly maimed by a scythe-wielding demon.  Jennifer flees as the demon kills Jackson.

The other tourists do not believe her, and Nicholas points out that the bottle she dropped earlier was for an antipsychotic.  Jennifer angrily denies being crazy.  The others attempt to calm her but do not believing her story about a demon.  As they argue, the bus wobbled precariously.  The panicked passengers quickly disembark, and Jennifer accidentally causes Curt to injure his hand.  Douglas announces that his son is a [[hemophilia|hemophiliac]] and accuses Jennifer of causing all their problems.  Abe leads them to an abandoned cabin and leaves to seek help from the miller at windmill, over Jennifer's objections.  Takashi wanders off alone and, after seeing a ghostly apparition of his beloved grandmother, expresses remorse for abandoning her.  He is apparently killed by the demon.

After returning, Abe finds an ancient document that says a local Devil-worshipping miller became an avenging demon after he was burned alive.  Each of the tourists find personal items in the cabin that remind them of dark secrets, and they experience nightmares or flashbacks.  Jennifer is revealed to have unintentionally caused her younger brother's death while killing their abusive father.  After treating Curt, Nicholas wanders outside, where he denounces a silent, ghostly patient for ruining his career because he was drunk while operating on her, causing her death.  Takashi returns to the others, witnessing the demon as it kills Nicholas.  The others at first blame Jennifer for Nicholas' death, but Takashi says, through Ruby's translation, that the demon spared him because of his remorse.

As the others come to believe Jennifer, they admit their sins: Ruby says she hired a yakuza to disfigure a rival model in Japan, and Douglas admits to killing his wife.  Ruby drowns after admiring her reflection in a pool of water, and the demonic miller decapitates Douglas.  Abe kills Takahashi, revealing himself as the miller's assistant, since the miller can not kill innocents or remorseful people.  Abe lures Curt and Jennifer back to the windmill under the pretense of helping them to set it on fire.  Jennifer expresses no regret for killing her abusive father, and the miller attacks her.  She is saved when Curt escapes Abe and sets the windmill on fire. As the miller disappears, Jennifer remembers her dead brother and risks her life to rescue Curt, slashing Abe's neck.

Abe survives his wound by using the dead tourists' ground bones in the mill to staunch the bleeding.  As he taunts Jennifer, telling her she can not escape her fate, the miller reappears and kills her in front of Curt.  Later, Abe picks up another bus load of tourists.  When one of them can not pay, Abe allows him on the bus, repeating the same line from earlier.

== Production ==
Nick Jongerius grew up near a windmill and said he always found them creepy.  The film was based on a concept trailer that proved popular on YouTube.  Once he had funding, however, Jongerius rethought many of the themes and changed their focus.<ref name=starburst/>  Jongerius cited [[Brian De Palma]] as an influence on his filmmaking, though he said he did not realize the extent of the influence until after completing ''The Windmill Massacre''.  Other influenced were [[Amicus Productions]] horror films and [[Agatha Christie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-filmmaker-nick-jongerius-on-the-windmill-screening-tonight-for-free-in-nyc/|title=Q&A: Filmmaker Nick Jongerius on ''The Windmill'', screening tonight for free in NYC!|last=Hanley|first=Ken W.|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2016-10-24|accessdate=2017-08-31}}</ref>
