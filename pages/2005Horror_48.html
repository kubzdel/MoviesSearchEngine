==Plot==

A fallen foot tall [[Homunculus]] called Marvin (a part human/part reptile creature) is imprisoned in a birdcage by a vengeful lover who is bidding to become the world's most powerful vampire.

Footage from ''[[Vampire Journals]]'' (a spin off from ''[[Subspecies]]'') is used at the beginning of the movie to explain how Morella, the vampire Queen, left her bloodline behind in Europe. The movie ends with Morella transformed into a [[Homunculus]] and having sex in the cage with Marvin.

==Reception==

The movie was released to mostly negative reviews. Despite this, a figure of the creature 'Marvin' was produced; a growing trend for Charles Band and Full Moon.

==Sequel==

''[[Decadent Evil II]]'' followed in 2007.<ref>http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/6433412/Decadent-Evil-Dead-2/Product.html</ref> The movie reunited Jill Michelle with Danniel Lennox, although Ivan Burroughs was played by [[Ricardo Gil]]. Fondacaro does, however, appear as Ivan Burroughs in ''[[Evil Bong]]''.
