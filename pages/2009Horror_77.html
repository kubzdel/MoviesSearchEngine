'''''The Final Destination''''' (alternatively known as '''''Final Destination 4''''') is a 2009 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] written by [[Eric Bress]] and directed by [[David R. Ellis]], both of whom also worked on ''[[Final Destination 2]]''. Released on August 28, 2009, it is the fourth installment of the [[Final Destination (film series)|''Final Destination'' film series]], and the first to be shot in [[High-definition video|HD]] [[3D film|3D]]. It is currently the highest-grossing ''Final Destination'' film, earning $186 million worldwide but also received the worst critical reception of the franchise. It was followed by ''[[Final Destination 5]].''

==Plot==
College student [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Nick O.27Bannon|Nick O'Bannon]] visits the McKinley Speedway with his girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Lori Milligan|Lori Milligan]] and their friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Hunt Wynorski|Hunt Wynorski]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Daniels|Janet Cunningham]]. While watching the race, Nick has a [[premonition]] of a horrible car accident that sends debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse. When Nick panics a fight breaks out and several people leave the stadium, including, Lori, Hunt, Janet, security guard [[List of Final Destination characters#George Lanter|George Lanter]], mechanic [[List of Final Destination characters#Andy Kewzer|Andy Kewzer]], his girlfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Nadia Monroy|Nadia Monroy]], racist tow truck driver [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Daniels|Carter Daniels]], and mother [[List of Final Destination characters#Samantha|Samantha Lane]]. As Nadia berates the group a stray tire suddenly flies out the stadium and decapitates her.

Several days after the accident, Carter tries to set a cross on fire on George's lawn for preventing him from saving his wife, but a chain reaction causes him to be dragged down the street on fire before his tow truck explodes. The next day, Samantha is leaving the [[hair salon|beauty salon]] when a rock propelled by a lawn mower is suddenly shot through her eye, killing her. After reading about the events in the paper and past disasters (of the previous films), Nick becomes convinced that Death is still after them. Hunt and Janet refuse to believe them, but they manage to convince George to help. The group visits the mechanic shop to warn Andy, but he is killed when a CO2 tank launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone to a country club pool. At the same time, George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes trapped in a malfunctioning car wash, and they manage to save her at the last second. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after accidentally turning the pool's drain on and when he dives in he is sucked down to the drain, where the increasing suction eventually sucks his organs through the drain pipe. Afterward, George admits that he tried to commit [[suicide]] several times, but every attempt has failed. Nick believes saving Janet must have ruined Death's plan and the group celebrates.

Four days later, Nick begins to see more omens and remembers asking [[cowboy]] [[List of Final Destination characters#Jonathan Groves|Jonathan Groves]] to switch seats prior to the accident, meaning he is actually next. Nick and George track Jonathan down at a hospital, where he remained in [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]] recovering from the accident, and they witness him being crushed by an overflowing bathtub that falls through the ceiling. As they leave, George is suddenly hit by a speeding ambulance and Nick realizes that Lori and Janet are still in danger. He tracks them down at a mall cinema and convinces Lori to leave, but Janet refuses and is killed by flying debris when a chain reaction causes the screen to explode. A multitude of explosions race Nick and Lori through the mall until they are trapped on a malfunctioning escalator and Lori is dragged into the gears and killed. This turns out to be another premonition, but George is killed by the ambulance before Nick can warn him. 

At the mall, Lori begins seeing omens as well. Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back to the mall to stop the explosion before it occurs. He is pinned to a wall by a nail gun but manages to stop the fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone. Two weeks later, Nick notices a loose scaffold prop while heading into a café and warns a construction worker about it before going inside. While talking with Lori and Janet, he starts to see more omens and alludes the theory that his predictions were [[red herrings]] meant to lead them to where they needed to be for Death to strike. Just as he realizes this the scaffold outside collapses, causing a truck to swerve and crash into the coffee shop, killing all three of them. Janet is crushed under the tires, Lori is decapitated by the impact, and Nick is propelled into a wall, dislocating his jaw.

===Development===
After the success of ''[[Final Destination 3]]'', which was initially planned to be in 3D,<ref>{{cite news|last=Miska|first=Brad|title=SET VISIT PART I: FINAL DESTINATION 4: 3-D Explodes in Our Face!|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEjm7pklbAwCml|work=[[Bloody-Disgusting]]|date=November 20, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}</ref> Eric Bress wrote a script, which impressed producer Craig Perry and [[Warner Bros.]] enough to green-light a fourth installment. [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] was on board to direct, but because of scheduling conflicts with ''[[Dragonball Evolution]]'', he decided to drop out. Consequently, the studio executives opted for [[David R. Ellis]] to return because of his work on ''[[Final Destination 2]]''.

The soundtrack attracted generally favorable reviews. Christian Clemmensen of [[Filmtracks.com]] gave the score 3 out of 5 stars and felt Tyler was "capable [...] to further explore new stylistic territory while making substantial use of the structures and tone of [predecessor composer] [[Shirley Walker]]'s music." His approach to the scores were called "intelligent", and provide "adequate if not strikingly overachieving recordings is testimony to his immense talents."

The reviewers were also impressed with the extension of the sound used by Walker in ''[[Final Destination 3]]''. "It relates to an affection for Walker's contribution to the industry," said an unnamed critic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/final_destination09.html |title=''The Final Destination'' review |work=Filmtracks.com | date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>

A SoundNotes reviewer grades the film with an impressive score of 7.5/10, remarking "Brian Tyler slugs his way through the inadequacies of ''The Final Destination'' and produces a score with reasonable entertainment value and enough of an appeal to make it function well apart from the woeful film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scorenotes.com/soundtracks/finaldestination.html |title=''The Final Destination'': Soundtrack Review |work= ScoreNotes.com}}</ref>

===Home media===
''The Final Destination'' was initially scheduled for a DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc]] release on December 22, 2009. The film was pushed back to January 5, 2010 in the US. Both the DVD and Blu-ray Disc included two pairs of 3D glasses with each set and featured a 2D version on the disc, along with additional scenes. Only the Blu-ray Disc version included two alternate endings, a "making of" featurette about the deaths, storyboard visualization and a preview of ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010 film)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (2010).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34418/the-final-destination-crashes-blu-ray-and-dvd |title=''The Final Destination'' Crashes onto Blu-ray and DVD |work=[[DreadCentral]] | date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> The Blu-ray Disc release, also a combo pack, includes a standard DVD of the film.

In [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores, some of the DVDs included an exclusive ''Final Destination'' comic book.

The movie was released uncut in Australian theaters with an [[Australian Classification Board#Film and video game classifications|MA15+]] (Strong horror violence, sex scene) rating. When the movie's DVD/Blu-ray Disc release was reviewed, the ACB (Australian Classification Board) noted several scenes in the 2D version that exceeded the guidelines of the MA15+ category. There were two editions released in Australia: a DVD version which only contains a censored 2D version (most of the blood effects taken off and gore trimmed) and a DVD release awarded an R18+ rating (High impact violence) with both uncensored 2D and 3D versions (and 3D glasses included). The covers between the two releases vary.

==Reception==
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 29% of 95 critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 4.2 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/final_destination_final_death_trip_3D/ |title=The Final Destination |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=June 20, 2010}}</ref> The site's consensus is: "With little of the ingenuity of previous installments, ''The Final Destination'' is predictable, disposable horror fare." [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, has a rating score of 30 based on 14 reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/finaldestination4 | title=''The Final Destination'': Reviews | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | date = January 14, 2009}}</ref>
