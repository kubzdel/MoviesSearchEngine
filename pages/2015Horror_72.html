==Reception==
Prior to its release ''The Entity'' received comparisons to similarly themed films such as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', and ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''.<ref name=LP /> Review websites Flickering Myth and Nerdly commented upon these comparisons, as both felt that ''The Entity'' suffered from being too overly familiar to pre-existing works.<ref name=nerdly>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=Frightfest 2015: ‘The Entity’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/08/28/frightfest-2015-the-entity-review/|publisher=Nerdly|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>[[Twitch Film]] was more positive, writing "Seasoned horror fans will find nothing new here, being able to guess most of the plot beats; but then again, Peruvian directors are just starting to try their hand at a genre which has been around for a long while. As more of them attempt to scare audiences, they'll hopefully improve on what came before. With its effective creepy atmosphere and solid use of an often-maligned gimmick, ''La Entidad'' is a good step in the right direction."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miñano|first1=Ernesto Zelaya|title=Review: LA ENTIDAD Is A Small Step Forward For Peruvian Horror|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2015/01/review-la-entidad-is-a-small-step-forward-for-peruvian-horror.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=11 November 2015}}</ref>
