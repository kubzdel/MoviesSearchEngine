'''''The Mother of Tears''''' ({{lang-it|La Terza madre}}, literally ''The Third Mother'') is a 2007 Italian-American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Dario Argento]], and starring [[Asia Argento]], [[Daria Nicolodi]], [[Moran Atias]], [[Udo Kier]] and Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni. The film has also been billed in English-speaking media as ''Mater Lachrymarum'', ''The Third Mother'' (English translation of the film's original Italian title) and ''Mother of Tears: The Third Mother''.<!-- Note: The spelling of "Lachrymarum" varies within this article intentionally. Argento uses "i" but de Quincey and Fangoria spell it with a "y" instead. Please do not change, for factual accuracy, the two different versions to a uniform spelling. -->

Written by Argento, [[Jace Anderson]], Walter Fasano, [[Adam Gierasch]] and Simona Simonetti, the film is the concluding installment of Argento's supernatural horror trilogy ''[[The Three Mothers]]'', which began with ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977) and succeeded by ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'' (1980). The film depicts the confrontation with the final "Mother" [[witchcraft|witch]], known as Mater Lachrymarum.

==Plot==
The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum ([[Moran Atias]]), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.

The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy ([[Asia Argento]]), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name "Mater Lachrymarum". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.

Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won't return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him. As she makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a witch, Katerina, who catches and corners her on the train.

At the priest's home, Sarah meets Marta, a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah's deceased mother. Realizing that Sarah's mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers. In response to this, Suspiriorum caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah's parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum's backstory to them by a patient of his. Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum's goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta's house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum's minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover's still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.

Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum's dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of "The Three Mothers" to read, and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum's lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion. At this point, she is joined by one of the police detectives hunting her and the two go into the catacombs to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum's minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers. Sarah, having healed the detective's wounds, uses a spear to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother's followers crushed as the cave collapses, Sarah and the detective laugh in horror and shock as they reach the surface, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.

====''The Three Mothers'' trilogy====
{{Main|The Three Mothers}}

''The Third Mother'' is the final film in Argento's trilogy known as ''[[The Three Mothers]]''. The trilogy is loosely based on characters from "[[Levana]] and Our Ladies of Sorrow", a section of [[Thomas De Quincey]]'s ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]''. The prose poem outlines the existence of three women that are the personification of sorrow: Mater Lachrymarum, Mater Suspiriorum and Mater Tenebrarum. Argento and [[Daria Nicolodi]] recast De Quincey's Three Sorrows as three malevolent witches who rule the world with tears, sighs and shadows. When released in 1977, the first film, ''[[Suspiria]]'', introduced the major stylistic elements of the series, including the bold use of [[primary color]]s and elaborate [[setpiece]]s for each murder. The sequel, ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'', developed the overarching plot continuities concerning the three central witches when released in 1980.

====Nicolodi script (1980s)====
As early as 1984 [[Daria Nicolodi]] asserted in an interview with ''Fangoria'' – alongside Argento – that they had "finished the script for the third [film] but there are a few things we are still working on to perfect the project, a couple of special effects and locations, that sort of thing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.argento.vervost.de/argento/interview_inferno.html|last=Argento|first=Dario|title=Interview with Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi Taken from FANGORIA Magazine – Volume No. 35 Issue 4|publisher=Master of Colors Dario Argento website|accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050306220246/http://argento.vervost.de/argento/interview_inferno.html |archivedate = 6 March 2005}}</ref> Although Nicolodi mentioned her version of the script again in an interview for Alan Jones' book, ''Profondo Argento: The Man, the Myths and the Magic'', it was not used in whole or part for ''The Third Mother''.

====Argento script (2003/4)====
On 29 November 2003, at the Trieste Science Plus Fiction Festival in Northern Italy, Argento revealed that he hoped to start filming ''The Third Mother'' in August 2004 and was currently working on the script.<ref name=fan-dec9>{{cite news | url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=1746 | title=Argento to raise THE THIRD MOTHER | date=9 December 2003 | publisher=[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065124/http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=1746 | archivedate=7 November 2007 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Thematically it concerned "[[mysticism]], [[alchemy]], terrorism and [[Gnosticism]] [...]. So many people were tortured because the Church said Gnosticism was heresy, and that will be the starting point for the story. [...] It has been over 20 years since I left the Three Mothers behind [...] and it has felt surprisingly good to go back and explore the whole story from a retrospective point of view."<ref name=fan-dec9/> The film was to be set in Rome and begin with Mater Lachrymarum in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=fan-dec9/> Argento originally hoped to cast a Russian model in the role of Mater Lachrymarum.<ref name=fan-dec9/> (He later chose Israeli actress [[Moran Atias]].<ref name=jones-set-report/>) Argento also said that a Hollywood studio might finance the film.<ref name=fan-dec9/>

====Anderson and Gierasch script (2005/6)====
In late 2005 Argento travelled to the North of Europe to begin conceptual work on ''The Third Mother''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Spettacoli/2005/07_Luglio/31/dario_argento.shtml |title=A Dario Argento "Piace Hitchcock" |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date=22 September 2005 |work=Corriere della Sera |author=Muglia, Alessandra |language=Italian}}</ref> Soon after, it was announced that Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch had been asked by Argento to help him write the film's script. "When we got there [Rome,] Dario had already done his own pass on the treatment, and we spent three weeks holed up in an apartment, meeting with Dario, visiting the catacombs, and getting the first draft done."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.horrorchannel.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3821 |title=HorrorChannel.com article (url no longer working) |year=2005 |publisher=HorrorChannel.com}}</ref> Around this time, ''Fangoria'' reported that the film would be entitled ''Mater Lachrymarum''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=5168 |title=Scripters talk Argento's MOTHER OF TEARS |accessdate=23 September 2007 |author=Decker, Sean |date= 23 November 2005 |publisher=Fangoria.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231072411/http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=5168 |archivedate=31 December 2005}}</ref>

The script for ''The Third Mother'' was still being refined in February 2006, with Anderson and Gierasch having composed a first draft which Argento then revised.<ref name=rosso-script>{{cite web |url=http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag02.htm |title=Dario Argento |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date=February 2006 |language=Italian, English |publisher=Profondo Rosso| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060506061938/http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag02.htm| archivedate = 6 May 2006}}</ref> This early script began immediately after ''[[Inferno (1980 film)|Inferno]]'', with a witch who survived the destruction of Mater Tenebrarum's home watching a detective ([[Ennio Fantastichini]]) investigating a series of murders at a University.<ref name=cine>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematografo.it/cinemedia/00004905.html |title=Set pronto per Argento |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date=17 May 2006 |publisher=Cinematografo |author=Editorial staff |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184649/http://www.cinematografo.it/cinemedia/00004905.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Other tentative cast members were [[Chiara Caselli]] as a psychiatrist, [[Max von Sydow]] as a mysterious university professor, and [[Giordano Petri]] as a young investigator who takes the case when Fantastichini's character is killed.<ref name=cine/> At this point, shooting was set to begin in late spring of the same year and was to be released between November 2006 and January 2007.<ref name=rosso-script/> However, in early 2006 rumors circulated that Argento had dismissed Anderson and Gierasch after being displeased with their script. French horror magazine ''L'Écran Fantastique'' reported that Argento alone would receive a screenwriting credit. On the tenth of March it was announced that shooting ''The Third Mother'' would be delayed until September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag02.htm |title=Dario Argento |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date=10 March 2006 |language=Italian, English |publisher=Profondo Rosso| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060506061938/http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag02.htm| archivedate = 6 May 2006}}</ref> In mid-April it was announced that Argento would return to Italy in June to immediately begin filming ''The Third Mother'', which would be "a big budget feature, produced by Medusa along with a major American company [Myriad]."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag04.htm |title=Dario Argento |accessdate=19 June 2007 |date=11 April 2006 |language=Italian, English |publisher=Profondo Rosso| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608070905/http://www.profondorossostore.com/News/news_pag04.htm| archivedate = 8 June 2007}}</ref> In May 2006 the title ''Mother of Tears'' surfaced as a possible name for the film. According to journalist Alan Jones, this title "was never in the running as far as Dario was concerned.

==Response==

===Critical reaction===
Critical response was mixed, although many reviewers felt the film, despite its flaws, was entertaining. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 50% approval rating with an average rating of 5.3/10 based on 72 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "As excessive and ketchup laden as predecessors ''Suspiria'' and ''Inferno'', Dario Argento's ''Mother of Tears'' completes the trilogy with the same baroque grandeur and soggy 1970s sensibilities."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1189181-1189181-mother_of_tears/ |title=La Terza Madre (Mother of Tears: The Third Mother) (2007) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 52 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mother-of-tears |title=Mother of Tears Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> The concluding film of ''The Three Mothers'' trilogy provided some reviewers with an opportunity to reflect on Argento's career as a whole, and parallels were often drawn between ''The Mother of Tears'' and Argento's films from the 1970s and 1980s.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Dennis Harvey wrote "This hectic pileup of supernatural nonsense is a treasure trove of seemingly unintentional hilarity...this "Mother" is a cheesy, breathless future [[Camp (style)|camp]] classic."<ref name=Harvey>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934653.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&query=Mother+of+Tears |title=Mother of Tears: The Third Mother |accessdate=7 June 2008 |author=Harvey, Dennis |date=8 September 2007 |work=Variety }}</ref>  Stephanie Zacharek of [[Salon.com]] opined that "''Mother of Tears'' is depraved, bloody and unrepentantly exploitive, and the plot makes virtually no sense—it's the sort of movie nobody, save Argento himself, is crazy enough to make these days. It's also so full of life that it dwarfs contemporary horror pictures of the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' variety."<ref name=Zacharek>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2008/06/06/mother_of_tears/index.html |title=Mother of Tears: The Third Mother |accessdate=8 June 2008 |author=Zacharek, Stephanie |date=8 September 2008 |publisher=Salon.com }}</ref> Jim Ridley in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' felt the film was further evidence of the declining quality of a once great director's abilities, stating that "for people who revere the horror maestro's vital work—roughly the period between his debut, 1970's proto–[[Brian De Palma|De Palma]] [[giallo]] ''[[The Bird with the Crystal Plumage]]'', and his 1990 segment of the anthology film ''[[Two Evil Eyes]]'' — it's painful to watch the [[Hieronymus Bosch]] of '70s horror sink this low...If you believe someone of Dario Argento's proven talent would make a movie so deliberately sucky, feel free to join in."<ref name=Ridley>{{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0823,one-bad-mother,458787,20.html |title=The Mother of Tears: Dario Argento Clowns Himself |accessdate=8 June 2008 |author=Ridley, Jim |date=3 June 2008 |publisher=Village Voice.com }}</ref>  [[Maitland McDonagh]] hated the film, describing it as "sadly lacking in the baroque atmosphere and visual aesthetic that elevated Argento above the horror hacks—it's flatly lit, indifferently staged, coarsely violent and brutally straightforward.

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Nathan Lee described the film as "...silly, awkward, vulgar, outlandish, hysterical, inventive, revolting, flamboyant, titillating, ridiculous, mischievous, uproarious, cheap, priceless, tasteless and sublime...[I]t may be the most entertaining film of [Argento's] career...It's true that ''The Mother of Tears'', strictly as visual storytelling, suffers by comparison with the first and second Mother movies, or one of Mr. Argento's better baroque thrillers, like ''The Bird with the Crystal Plumage''. But it does something as well as, if not better than, anything in his oeuvre: it goes all the way."<ref name=Lee>{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/movies/06arge.html?em&ex=1212984000&en=b0ce706138274654&ei=5087%0A&8mu& |title=Mother of Tears, The: Supernatural Stew, Served With Camp |accessdate=7 June 2008 |author=Lee, Nathan |date=6 June 2008 |publisher=New York Times.com }}</ref> Scooter McCrae of ''[[Fangoria]]'' was extremely enthusiastic about the film, and said that "''Mother of Tears'' is a great movie, and well worth the wait. Does it have flaws? Oh yeah, but so do ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]'', ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'', ''Suspiria'' and ''Inferno'', and they're now all part of the accepted canon of classic Argento cinema."<ref name=McCrae>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/ghastly_review.php?id=6203 |title=Mother of Tears |accessdate=7 June 2008 |author=McCrae, Scooter |publisher=Fangoria.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080403055406/http://www.fangoria.com/ghastly_review.php?id=6203| archivedate = 3 April 2008}}</ref> ''[[Cinefantastique]]''{{'}}s Steve Biodrowski also felt the film was worthy of praise, noting that "the experience of watching ''Mother of Tears'' is like a delirious descent into primordial chaos, where the powers of darkness hold sway...As a long-awaited coda to Argento's "Three Mothers" trilogy, [it] may not be exactly what was expected, but it is perfectly satisfying resolution...."<ref name=Biodrowski>{{cite web |url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/06/06/film-review-mother-of-tears-2007 |title=Mother of Tears |accessdate=10 June 2008 |author=Biodrowski, Steve |date=6 June 2008|publisher=cfq.com }}</ref>

Argento has noted that he is dismissive of critical reaction, saying that "the critics don't understand very well. But critics are not important – absolutely not important. Because now audiences don't believe anymore in critics. Many years ago critics wrote long articles about films. Now in seven lines they are finished: 'The story is this. The actor is this. The color is good.'"<ref>

==Soundtrack==
[[Claudio Simonetti]] composed the soundtrack for ''The Third Mother'', which was completed in early April 2007 after four months of work.<ref name=simonetti/> He chose a [[Classical music|classical style]] with [[Medieval music|Gothic]] influences present in many of the choruses. Simonetti described the score as "very different" from his previous work due to the subject matter of the film.<ref name=simonetti/> The music was influenced by his own work for Argento's ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' episodes ("[[Jenifer (Masters of Horror episode)|Jenifer]]" and "[[Pelts (Masters of Horror episode)|Pelts]]") as well as composers such as [[Carl Orff]], [[Jerry Goldsmith]], and [[Bernard Herrmann]] (among others).<ref name=simonetti/> The score also incorporates [[electronic music]] and influences from Simonetti's earlier work on Argento films, such as ''[[Suspiria]]'' and ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]''.<ref name=simonetti/>

The piece at the end of Simonetti's "Mater Lachrimarum" is called "Dulcis in Fondo" and was performed by his heavy metal band, Daemonia.<ref name=simonetti/> [[Cradle of Filth]] frontman [[Dani Filth]] recorded a song with Simonetti, ''Mater Lacrimarum'', for the soundtrack of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.it/news/story.aspx?newsitemID=17749 |title=CRADLE OF FILTH |author=Roadrunner Records |accessdate=11 August 2007 |date=10 August 2007 |language=Italian| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927040316/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.it/news/story.aspx?newsitemID=17749| archivedate = 27 September 2007}}</ref>

The soundtrack was recorded in the Acquario Studio of Castelnuovo in Porto-Roma. The symphonic orchestra parts were performed by the Orchestra D.I.M.I. The choral parts were performed by the [[Nova Lyrica]] chorus in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novalyrica.it/pagine/coro.html |title=Nova Lyrica – Coro lirico – Roma |accessdate=4 May 2007 |language=Italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081250/http://www.novalyrica.it/pagine/coro.html |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Both were recorded in Lead Studios in Rome with the help of sound-man Giuseppe Ranieri. Filmmakers finished dubbing the soundtrack into the film on 5 April 2007.<ref name=simonetti/> At the preview during the Cannes Film Festival, journalist Alan Jones described Simonetti's score as an "unqualified success".<ref name=jones-cannes/>
