{{more plot|date=May 2018}}
Chloe Severin, a student of archaeology in the first semester, is participating in an excavation under the direction of Professor Vernet. According to legend, the heavily wooded location, [[Brocéliande]], is the burial site of [[King Arthur]] and the wizard [[Merlin]]. Soon after their arrival, a series of mysterious murders begins to thin the ranks of the participants, all victims brandishing wounds from Druids sickles. Upon pursuing the mystery and the excavation, Chloe encounters a very lively pagan cult and its horned priest.<ref>[http://www.cinemovies.fr/fiche_film.php?IDfilm=888 Brocéliande - Film de Doug Headline avec Cédric Chevalme] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005093751/http://www.cinemovies.fr/fiche_film.php?IDfilm=888 |date=5 October 2008 }}</ref>
