=== Critical reception ===
Omer Bashir of ''[[Dawn.com]]'' gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote <nowiki>''</nowiki>In the end, while ''Hotal''’s plot failed to connect on any emotional level, it raises important questions about our film industry, the mainly homogenous titles it brings forth and the lack of diversity in roles offered to female leads.<nowiki>''</nowiki><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1175361|title=Review: My trip to Hotal with Meera Jee raised serious questions about Pakistani cinema|last=Bashir|first=Omer|date=2016-05-17|work=Images|access-date=2018-05-19|language=en-US}}</ref>
