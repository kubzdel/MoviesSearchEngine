==Synopsis==
A brother and sister, Devon ([[Tim Draxl]]) and Regina ([[Christine Lakin]]), survive a brutal attack in the small town in which their mother was raised.  As adults they return to the town to sell their mother's property and get on with their lives.  They return to the town with three friends: Tom ([[Justin Hartley]]), Samir (Ankur Bhatt), and Terra ([[Katie Maguire]]).

But in returning home they run into old friend Harley ([[Noah Fleiss]]) and old enemy Mac ([[Norman Reedus]]), and returning to that dark place awakens a killing rage in a town where everyone has ties that bind.  Regina learns that no one and nothing can be trusted â€” not even her own memories. She learns the past doesn't simply haunt, it hurts.
