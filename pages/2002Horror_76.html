'''''Second Name''''' (''El Segundo Nombre'' in Spanish) is a 2002 Spanish [[horror film]]. The film is based on 2001 horror novel ''Pact of the Fathers'' by English horror writer [[Ramsey Campbell]].

==Plot==
{{rewrite section|date=March 2018}}
After the suicide of her father, Daniella (Erica Prior) investigates her family's past.

The plot involves a [[sect]] called the [[Abrahamites]], who (according to the movie) sacrifice their first borns following an alternative interpretation of God's Will in the [[Binding of Isaac|near-sacrifice of Isaac]].

[[Caravaggio]]'s [[Sacrifice of Isaac (Caravaggio)|Ufizzi version]] of the biblical scene is shown in the movie to illustrate this alternative belief.

The movie version of the Abrahamites traditionally give their first borns the father's middle name, hence the title of the movie.
