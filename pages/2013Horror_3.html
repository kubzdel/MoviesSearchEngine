For a thousand years man has been adding a day to the calendar every 4 years and in doing so violated mankind's interpretation of the Mayan Calendar's prediction that the world would end in 2012. On the 13th day of the 13th month of the new millennium, survivors confront a world of demons. On 13/13/13 the entire human race (with the exception of those born on a leap year) go insane.

==Critical response==
''[[Fangoria]]'' panned the film, noting that The Asylum took a break from its fare of oversized monsters to present this film "devoid of any creatures that instead tries its hand at suspense—and ultimately leaves one wishing for more shark tales."<ref name="Fangoria 1"/>  Director James Cullen Bressack presented his supernatural take on ''[[The Crazies (2010 film)|The Crazies]]'' but, being backed by The Asylum meant "a tiny budget, brief shooting schedule and lack of quality talent",<ref name="Fangoria 1"/> resulting in a film that failed to give a compelling story. The dialogue was considered "groan-inducing" and the score "grating". The storyline had characters going "bonkers" and the film was weakened by simply spending "too much time showing people sitting around and laughing at each other".  Add Trae Ireland's lead character of Jack offering a "pointless backstory at the wrong time, and you’ve got a film where everyone is going insane, but perhaps none more than the viewer."<ref name="Fangoria 1"/>  They offered that the film missed its intended mark. "The photography, audio and editing are all inconsistent—though they’re what one might expect from a film whose DVD cover image never appears in the movie itself. Interesting fact about the Mayan calendar: On the date of 13/13/13, there won’t be any color correction. The unimpressive special features include a making-of segment, a gag reel and some trailers",<ref name="Fangoria 1"/> and concluded "''13/13/13'' is an effort that offers very little worth. If only the Mayans could have seen this coming, they might have adjusted their calendar accordingly".<ref name="Fangoria 1">{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=J.D.|title="13/13/13" (DVD Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/131313-dvd-review/|accessdate=May 20, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520153309/http://www.fangoria.com/new/131313-dvd-review/|archivedate=May 20, 2015|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=December 26, 2013}}</ref>

''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Magazine]]'' noted that despite Bressack having a strong background in film ''13/13/13'' "is a bad film. It is a poorly conceived, ill-judged piece of filmmaking that relies entirely on disappointingly tiresome shock tactics to draw any cohesive response from its audience".<ref name="Starburst Magazine">{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=John|title=13/13/13 review|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/11193-131313-dvd|accessdate=May 20, 2015|publisher=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Magazine]]|date=February 18, 2015}}</ref>

Contrarily, ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' felt that despite some weaknesses the film contained enough expected surprises to be worth a watch, writing "one of the things that makes Bressack’s films appealing to me is the personal level which he is unafraid to venture to."<ref name="Ain't It Cool News"/>  The film contained "some very effective scenes, mostly involving kids who get either caught in the mêlée or affected by the disease, but for the most part it doesn’t plumb the depths to which Bressack’s other films dare go".<ref name="Ain't It Cool News">{{cite news|last1=Bug|first1=Ambush|title=AICN Horror looks at 13/13/13|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/65019#7|accessdate=May 20, 2015|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>
