'''''The Wicker Man''''' is a 2006 [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Neil LaBute]] and starring [[Nicolas Cage]].<ref name="The Wicker Man 2006">{{cite web|url=http://alt.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/641977/Wicker-Man-The/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 2006|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref> The film primarily is a [[remake]] of the 1973 film ''[[The Wicker Man]]'', but also draws from its source material, David Pinner's 1967 novel ''[[Ritual (1967 novel)|Ritual]]''. The film concerns a policeman named Edward Malus who is informed by his ex-fiancée Willow Woodward that her daughter Rowan has disappeared and asks for his assistance in her search. When he arrives at the island where Rowan was last seen he begins to suspect something sinister is afoot with the [[Modern paganism|neo-pagans]] who reside on the island.

The film received hostile reviews from film critics at the time of its release; critics pointed to the film's unintentional comedy, weak acting, and poor screenwriting. The film was also a financial flop, grossing over $38 million against a $40 million production budget. Since its original release, it has developed a [[cult following]] as an entertaining unintentional comedy, particularly due to Cage's over-the-top performance.

Cage dedicated the film to his friend [[Johnny Ramone]], the guitarist of the band [[The Ramones]], who had died in 2004.

==Plot==
Policeman Edward Malus ([[Nicolas Cage]]) receives news from his ex-fiancée, Willow Woodward ([[Kate Beahan]]), that her daughter, Rowan (Erika Shaye Gair), is missing. He travels to the western United States and takes a ferry to a coastal area where he gets a pilot ([[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]]) to take him to an island off the coast of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] where a group of [[Modern paganism|neo-pagans]] live.

The island is led by Sister Summersisle ([[Ellen Burstyn]]), an elderly woman who supposedly represents the [[goddess]] they worship. Sister Summersisle explains to Edward that her ancestors had left England to avoid persecution, only to settle near Salem and find renewed persecution in the [[Salem witch trials]], before arriving on the island. Sister Summersisle explains that their population is predominantly female as they choose the strongest stock&mdash;evading Edward's concern about the birth of unwanted males. The economy of the island relies on the production of local honey, which Edward learns has declined recently.

Edward asks the villagers about Rowan, but they give him evasive answers. He later sees two men carrying a large bag that appears to be dripping blood, and then he finds a fresh, unmarked grave in the churchyard. The grave turns out to contain only a burned doll, but Edward finds Rowan's sweater in the churchyard.

At the village school, teacher Sister Rose ([[Molly Parker]]) tries to prevent Edward from seeing the class register. When he sees that Rowan's name has been crossed out he becomes enraged at the teacher's and Rowan's classmates' lies. Rose demands Edward talk outside and, after a short discussion of the island people's view of death, Rose explains that Rowan is "letting it snow". Edward asks how Rowan died and Sister Rose tells him first that "She'll burn to death". When Edward catches the tense she used, Sister Rose corrects herself quickly, saying, "She burned to death", and rushes back to her class.

When Edward questions Willow about the grave, she reveals that Rowan is his daughter.

As Edward searches through the island for clues and answers, he eventually grows to realise the community is a [[matriarchal religion|matriarchal]] [[dystopian]] society.

On the day of the [[fertility rite]], Edward frantically searches the village for Rowan. He attacks Sister Beech ([[Diane Delano]]), who has a bear costume for the ritual. Edward incapacitates Sister Honey ([[Leelee Sobieski]]), dons the bear suit, and joins the parade led by Sister Summersisle.

The parade ends at the site of the festival. Rowan is tied to a large tree, seemingly about to be burned. Edward rescues Rowan and they run away through the woods, but Rowan leads him back to Sister Summersisle. Sister Summersisle thanks Rowan for her help, and Edward realizes that the search for Rowan was a trap. Sister Willow is Sister Summersisle's daughter, and his fate was sealed many years ago, when Sister Willow chose him. The villagers attack Edward and overpower him, viciously breaking his legs with a mallet to prevent him from escaping. They then place a cage-like helmet on his head, and pour live bees into it, which sting him mercilessly. Throughout all this, he keeps asking how can he be a good sacrifice if he does not believe in their religion. The women carry him to a giant [[wicker man]] and shut him inside. Rowan sets fire to the wicker man and Edward is sacrificed amid his screams and a giant blaze. The crowd chants "The drone must die!", believing that Edward's sacrifice will restore their honey production.

Six months later, sisters Willow and Honey enter a bar and start talking with two off-duty police officers ([[James Franco]] and [[Jason Ritter]]). Sister Honey offers to go home with one of the cops, presumably in hopes of using them as they used Edward. The buzzing of bees and screaming from Edward Malus can be heard over Sister Honey as the film cuts to black.

==Production==
[[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] had been planning a remake of the 1973 [[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|film of the same name]]<ref name="The Wicker Man 1973">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95785/The-Wicker-Man/full-credits.html|title=The Wicker Man 1973|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|location=[[Atlanta]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref> since the 1990s. The British film had been in the licensing library of [[Canal+]], which was optioned by producer [[JoAnne Sellar]] to Universal. In March 2002 it was revealed that Neil LaBute was writing and directing ''The Wicker Man'' for Universal and [[Nicolas Cage]]'s production company Saturn Films.<ref name=laddie>{{cite news|author = Jonathan Bing | url =https://variety.com/2002/film/news/wicker-horror-war-erupts-1117864269|title=‘Wicker’ horror war erupts|work=Variety|date=March 20, 2002|accessdate = March 18, 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, the original film's director [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]] and star [[Christopher Lee]] were preparing a semi-remake of their 1973 film, titled ''The Riding of the Laddie'', with [[Vanessa Redgrave]] and Lee's ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' co-star [[Sean Astin]] attached. Hardy stated Lee would not play the villain as he did in the original ''Wicker Man'', but instead a door-to-door born again Christian preacher who comes to Scotland along with his wife (Redgrave) as they are introduced to the neo-pagan cult. Hardy hoped for filming to begin in Glasgow, Scotland in 2003, but ''The Riding of the Laddie'' would not materialize until years later, when it had undergone many changes to become the film ''[[The Wicker Tree]]''. Universal's remake with LaBute moved forward, who changed the Scots setting to contemporary America.<ref name=laddie/> The remake rights eventually moved from Universal to [[Millennium Films]]. Filming began in Vancouver, Canada in July 2005.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dana Harris| url = https://variety.com/2005/film/news/nic-s-next-pic-is-indie-wicker-1117918868|title=Nic’s next pic is indie ‘Wicker’|work=Variety|date=March 3, 2005|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Upon release the film received mainly negative reviews from film critics. The film holds a 15% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 107 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] score of  3.5/10. The site's consensus says, "Puzzlingly misguided, Neil LaBute's update ''The Wicker Man'' struggles against unintentional comedy and fails."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_wicker_man_2006/ | title=''The Wicker Man'' (2006)| work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] | accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a [[standard score|normalized score]] of 36% from 19 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-wicker-man | title=''The Wicker Man'' Reviews| work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] gave it rating of "F" based on surveys from general audiences. On ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]'', the film received two thumbs down from [[Richard Roeper]] and [[Aisha Tyler]], although they both said the film was "entertainingly bad". The film was not without its positive reviews, however, as film critic [[Owen Gleiberman]] of [[Entertainment Weekly]], saw the film in a more positive light, with Gleiberman saying that director Neil LaBute brought some "innovation" over the original film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1528109,00.html|title=The Wicker Man Movie Review|author=[[Owen Gleiberman]]|date=30 August 2006|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref>

The original film's director, [[Robin Hardy (film director)|Robin Hardy]], had expressed skepticism over the Hollywood remake, and had his lawyers make [[Warner Bros.]] remove his name from the remake's promotional material. According to Hardy, he was given writing credit for the screenplay, when he had not received any for the original. [[Christopher Lee]], who played Lord Summerisle in the original film, commented: "I don't believe in remakes. You can make a follow up to a film, but to remake a movie with such history and success just doesn't make sense to me."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LEE%3A+THE+WICKER+MOAN%3B+Exclusive+Screen+legend+celebrates+six+decades...-a0147030053| location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | title=Scotsman.com News | date=11 September 2005}}</ref>

Cage himself acknowledged that the film was "absurd". He remarked in 2010: "There is a mischievous mind at work on ''The Wicker Man'', you know? You know what I mean? And I finally kind of said, 'I might have known that the movie was meant to be absurd.' But saying that now after the fact is OK, but to say it before the fact is not, because you have to let the movie have its own life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/video/watch/16737337001/76466640001|title= Interview with Nicolas Cage|author=[[Drew McWeeny]]|date=7 April 2010|publisher=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=22 August 2011}}</ref> In February 2012, Cage gave a live webchat with fans to promote ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]''. When asked what roles from his career he would most like to revisit, Cage responded, "I would like to hook up with one of the great Japanese filmmakers, like [[Hideo Nakata|the master]] that made ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'', and I would like to take ''The Wicker Man'' to Japan, except this time he's a ghost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1444|title=Exclusive Nicolas Cage Webchat|author=Cage, Nicolas|date= February 2012|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

Since the film's release, the scene where Nicolas Cage's character gets tortured by bees as well as the scene where he discovered the burned doll have become [[internet memes]].

===Box office===
''The Wicker Man'' opened on September 1, 2006 in 2,784 venues and earned $9,610,204 in its opening weekend, ranking third in the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&wknd=35&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for September 1-3, 2006 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=September 4, 2006 | accessdate=August 16, 2015}}</ref> The film closed on November 16, 2006 after eleven weeks of release, grossing $23,649,127 domestically and $15,105,946 overseas for a worldwide total of $38,755,073. Based on a $40 million budget, the film was a [[box office bomb]].<ref name="mojo">{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=wickerman.htm | title=The Wicker Man (2006) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref>
