'''''Finale''''' is a 2009 [[horror film]] directed by [[John Michael Elfers]] and starring [[Carolyn von Hauck]]. Inspired by actual events from the director's life, FINALE is reminiscent of ''Suspiria'', ''Hellraiser'' and ''Rosemary's Baby'', shot in super 16mm to capture an authentic 1970s feel, with all practical in-camera effects, borrowed from the lost arts of early film magicians.

The film was released in the United States on May 25, 2010, after premiering at [[A Night of Horror]] in Sydney Australia, and [[Screamfest]] in the U.S. in 2009.<ref name="screamfest opens">{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematical.com/2009/10/16/screamfest-la-starts-today/ |title=Screamfest LA Starts Today |accessdate=2009-10-16|work=cenmatical}}</ref>
