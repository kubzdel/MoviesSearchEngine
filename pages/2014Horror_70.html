'''''Dracula Untold''''' is a 2014 American [[dark fantasy]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Gary Shore]] in [[List of directorial debuts|his feature film debut]] and written by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]].<ref name="Gary" /> Rather than using the storyline of [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'', the film creates an [[origin story]] for its title character, [[Count Dracula]]; in this version, Dracula is [[Vlad the Impaler]]. [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]] portrays the title character, and [[Sarah Gadon]], [[Dominic Cooper]], [[Art Parkinson]], and [[Charles Dance]] appear in supporting roles.

[[Principal photography]] began in [[Northern Ireland]] on August 5, 2013. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] released the film in regular and [[IMAX]] cinemas on October 10, 2014.

Despite being a box office success, grossing $217 million worldwide, ''Dracula Untold'' received negative critical reviews, with praise for Luke Evans's performance and the story, and criticism of the characterization.

==Plot==
<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summary for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. At the time of this notice this summary is exactly 700 words -->
Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Țepeș]] is the Prince of [[Wallachia]] and [[Transylvania]]. As a child, he was a royal hostage in the palace of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite [[Janissaries]] corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called [[Vlad the Impaler]] after slaughtering thousands by [[Impalement|impaling]] them on spears.

Now ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's [[retinue]]. Returning to his castle, Vlad learns from a local [[monk]] that the creature is a [[vampire]], who was magically trapped in the cave many years ago. Vlad celebrates an [[Easter]] feast with his wife Mirena and son Îngeraș, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the [[Ambassador|emissary]] wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition.

Knowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad singlehandedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to [[Cozia Monastery]] for safety.

Mirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attacking them for blood. Vlad's sudden increased strength also arouses suspicion among his subjects.

That night, the Ottoman army marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap Ingeras. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Despite his superhuman speed, Vlad cannot reach her in time. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises and lifts his curse, so that he will have the strength to save their son. Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to block out the sun. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.

At the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding Îngeraș captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human — and impairing his vision — as Mehmed fights him with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name "Dracula, Son of the Devil", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood. Vlad then sends Îngeraș away before his vampire army preys on him, and dispels the storm clouds so that the vampires, including himself, will burn away and die in the light. However, a man who had previously observed Vlad's nature and wished to serve him drags his dying body out of the sunlight and offers him his blood, which restores Vlad to life. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, Îngeraș is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia.

In the present day, Vlad meets a woman named [[Mina Harker|Mina]], who strikingly resembles Mirena, in the streets of a modern city (London), while the vampire who cursed Vlad watches them from afar. As they walk away, he follows, saying "Let the games begin".

[[Richard Corliss]] from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] compared Dracula's origin story to [[Jesus Christ]]'s story due to Dracula spending his childhood in a foreign land, and due to Dracula choosing to die (or become undead) in order to save his people. Corliss also complimented the film's use of its PG-13 rating by describing it as "robust". In his review, he stated, "Most reviewers have slammed the movie, but it's not nearly as awful, or offal, as its critical odor."
