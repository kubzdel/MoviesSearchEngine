'''''Dante's Hell Animated''''' is a 2013 American animated short film produced and directed by Boris Acosta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Screening of "Dante's Inferno" and "Dante's Hell" by Boris Acosta – Feb. 10|date=February 9, 2015|url=http://www.italianfoundation.org/screening-dantes-inferno-dantes-hell-boris-acosta-feb-10/|work=Fondazione Italia}}</ref>

The story is based on the first part of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' – ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.

==Plot==
This film has two versions, narrated in English and recited in Italian. The Italian version is recited in primitive Italian and [[Dante Alighieri]]'s own words as he wrote the poem.

Dante gets lost in a dark wood, his way is blocked and he is threatened by three beasts: a lion, a lynx and a she-wolf. Beatrice descends from Heaven into Limbo to ask the poet Virgil to go to Dante's rescue and guide him through Inferno and Purgatorio. The film depicts a chronological descent to the nine circles of hell by Dante and Virgil through the exit into Purgatorio.
