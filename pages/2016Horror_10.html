== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}

In his appreciative film review,  Mike Haberfelner concluded by offering the film "is a nice throwback to grindhouse horror of the 1970s, it's blunt and violent, but understands when to show its shocks and when to actually better hide them for full effect, it makes up for its low budget with a well-structured story and a very steady pace, and its no-frills directorial effort really works for the movie's impact. And a solid ensemble cast doesn't hurt, either. Cool genre entertainment, really!"<ref name="SMT">[http://www.searchmytrash.com/movies/amityvillelegacy%282016%29.shtml Review: ''The Amityville Legacy''], ''Search My Trash'', by Mike Haberfelner</ref>
