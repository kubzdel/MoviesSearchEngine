'''''Sick Nurses''''' ({{lang-th|สวยลากไส้}} or ''Suay Laak Sai'') is a 2007 [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] [[Slasher film|slasher]] film, written and directed by [[Piraphan Laoyont]] and [[Thodsapol Siriwiwat]].

==Plot==
In a run-down, suburban [[Bangkok]] hospital, young Dr. Tar (Wichan Jarujinda) and seven nurses have been running a scheme to sell dead bodies on the black market. However, one nurse, Tahwaan (Chol Wachananont), has found out that her boyfriend, Dr. Tar, has been having an affair with her sister, Nook (Chidjun Rujiphan). Growing tired of the body-selling scam and enraged by her sister and boyfriend's betrayal, Tahwaan threatens to call the police.

However, before Tahwaan can take action, the doctor and six resident nurses at the hospital strap Tahwaan to an operating table, kill her, and then wrap her in a black plastic garbage bag. They then dump her in the trunk of the doctor’s car, where her corpse will be kept on dry ice until it can be sold.

All the women have their own obsessions and weaknesses. The spirit of Tahwaan uses these obsessions to torment and ultimately kill the other six nurses. Scenes shown toward the end of the film indicate that many of these obsessions were in part encouraged by Dr. Tar, or in some cases, used by him to seduce some of the women. For example, Aeh ([[Kanya Rattanapetch]]) seems unhealthily attracted to material possession such as jewelry, dresses, and handbags. One brief scene shows Dr. Tar giving Aeh a handbag that was shown sewn to her head and neck earlier in such a manner that when Nook tries to undo the stitching, Aeh is left decapitated.

It is eventually revealed that Tahwaan was once a homosexual male who had undergone a sex change so that he could marry Dr. Tar. She finally kills her own sister by being literally reborn through her and as she stares at Tar, she mutters "marry me" and the screen goes black

==Release and reception==
''Sick Nurses'' was released in [[List of cinemas in Thailand|Thailand cinemas]] on June 14, 2007, where critical and box-office response was muted and maybe due to less cinema release of 50 and runs only for 2 weeks. According to Box-officeMojo.com its total gross to date is $335,399  <ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/thailand/?yr=2007&wk=25&p=.htm Suay Laak Sai (Sick Nurses) total gross] Thailand Box Office June 21–24, 2007</ref> excluding the DVD sales worldwide.

''[[Bangkok Post]]'' film critic Kong Rithdee characterized the film as exploitive and complained that the film's general release was allowed by the same [[Censorship in Thailand|Board of Censors]] that had earlier in the year banned director [[Apichatpong Weerasethakul]]'s drama film, ''[[Syndromes and a Century]]'', because of what the board said were objectionable portrayals of medical professionals. "What's more saddening than seeing bad exploitation movies is the double standards of the people who have power. Unfortunately we have both of them right here in Thailand," he wrote.<ref>[http://www.thaifilm.com/articleDetail_en.asp?id=104 Just plain queasy], Kong Rithdee, ''Bangkok Post'' via Thai Film Foundation; retrieved 2007-11-26</ref>

In July 2007, at a workshop discussion on censorship in Thailand, producer [[Prachya Pinkaew]] revealed that the Board of Censors had in fact called for cuts to be made in the film, asking that a scene in which a [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|medical cross symbol]] falls off the hospital building and kills a character be altered to eliminate the killing, because the censors believed that was a bad association for the symbol.

The film was shown at the 2007 [[Hawaii International Film Festival]] in the "Extreme Asia" section, where it received a positive review from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', which called the film "slickly executed".<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935345.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 Sick Nurses (review)], Richard Kuipers, ''Variety''; retrieved 2007-11-26</ref>

As of 2008, the film has been released on DVD in Thailand with no English subs and in America with English and Spanish subs.

The late Brazilian [[Boca do Lixo]] director [[Carlos Reichenbach]] screened the film in one of the last sessions he used to organize, the Sessão do Comodoro, in São Paulo.
