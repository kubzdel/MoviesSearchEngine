==Synopsis==
When he was a child Roscoe (James Sizemore and Emmett Eckert) was frequently visited by Dimwos (John Chatham), an elder demon, at night. One day Dimwos lures Roscoe into a portal that takes him to a strange world where Dimwos teaches Roscoe various things, including his ancient language. Dimwos withholds nothing from Roscoe, save one single secret that ends up becoming Roscoe's downfall, when he releases three deadly demons. Roscoe manages to flee by crossing back through the portal to the human world, but ends up taking the three demons with him. Once back in the human world, Roscoe recollects his previous human existence and the childhood friend he left behind, Eva (Ashleigh Jo Sizemore and Grace Kilgore), who has grown into a beautiful woman. This all causes conflict within Roscoe, as this clashes with what Dimwos had led him to believe. Now Roscoe must track down the three demons and battle them into submission while also trying to deal with the evil they're unleashing on the unsuspecting world.
