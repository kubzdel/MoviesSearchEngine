'''''The Last Winter''''' is a 2006 [[thriller film]] directed by [[Larry Fessenden]]. ''The Last Winter'' premiered in The Contemporary World Cinema Programme at the 2006 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2006. The [[Script (recorded media)|script]] for the film originally featured a more woodsy [[Alaska]] with pine trees and it was after a research trip to [[Prudhoe Bay]] that they discovered the harsh flat conditions that ultimately ended up in the film.<ref>[http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=1379 A Chat with Larry Fessenden] on Shock till you Drop.com, September 17, 2007</ref>

== Plot ==
The American oil company KIK Corporation is building an ice road to explore the remote northern [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] seeking [[United States energy independence|energy independence]]. Independent [[environmentalists]] work together in a drilling base headed by the tough Ed Pollack in a sort of agreement with the [[government]], approving procedures and sending reports of the operation. When one team member is found dead and naked on the [[snow]], the environmentalist James Hoffman suspects that [[sour gas]] ([[natural gas]] containing [[hydrogen sulfide]]) may have been leaked out as a result of [[runaway climate change]] ([[arctic methane release]]).  The sour gas might then be provoking [[hallucination]]s and [[insanity]] in the group.  After a second fatal incident, he convinces Ed to travel with the team to a [[hospital]] for examination. However, weird events end up trapping the group at the base.

One of the characters presently opines that Nature itself has turned against mankind. [[Documentation]] and research found in an abandoned [[shack]] in the middle of the Arctic by another team member suggest that the [[Earth]] is releasing 'The Last Winter'. This implies that the rapacious, virus-like behavior of oil-seeking humans has resurrected the 'ghosts' of the fossil-fuels being siphoned out of the ground. The chief catalyst here is allegedly the Spirit of the [[Wendigo]]. These ghosts and other bizarre occurrences kill off most of the remaining characters. In the penultimate scene, Hoffman must decide whether to fire a [[flare gun]] at a ghost stalking Pollack, or up into the air to summon help from a nearby town, opting for the latter. This action causes the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] to focus on Hoffman instead of Pollack, and it grabs him and carries him off.  The scene then segues into a montage of past life images which interrupt themselves long enough to reveal Pollack being attacked and presumably killed by a trio of spectral creatures.

The ending scene is that of the only surviving researcher,  Abby Sellers, waking up alone in a deserted hospital with no recollection of arriving there. A news anchorman is broadcasting over a television in the waiting room about natural disasters occurring nationwide. She discovers a male [[employee]] who has committed [[suicide]] by [[hanging]] himself in one of the rooms. She proceeds outside, and the camera's perspective switches to a claustrophobic overhead shot that gives away very little of what she is witnessing. There are pools of [[water]] on the ground nearby. In the background she hears car alarms and the sound of the wind, as well as a fluttering noise similar to that made by the murderous "ghost" creatures further north in the Alaskan snow fields.

== Production ==
Fessenden's first idea for the script involved a Muslim and a non-Muslim forced to depend on each other in a remote location.  This was later mixed with and refined by other ideas that involved the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and global warming.<ref name=slant>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/this-is-the-way-the-world-ends-an-interview-with-the-last-winter-writerdirector-larry-fessenden|title=This Is the Way the World Ends: An Interview with The Last Winter Writer-Director Larry Fessenden|last=Kipp|first=Jeremiah|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  The idea of stranding two people with radically different outlooks was subsequently incorporated into the film's ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_LarryFessenden.htm|title=ICONS Interview with Larry Fessenden|work=Icons of Fright|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  The setting was partially inspired by ''[[Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage]]'', a non-fiction book about wilderness survival in the Antarctic.  Fessenden brought in co-writer Robert Leaver to collaborate with, and the two went back and forth on various ideas.  Fessenden said, "Ultimately I wanted to show how an individual’s worldview affects how he or she deals with reality."<ref name=iw>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2007/09/indiewire-interview-the-last-winter-director-larry-fessenden-73869/|title=indieWIRE INTERVIEW {{!}} ''The Last Winter'' Director Larry Fessenden|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=2007-09-18|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  When writing the characters, Fessenden gave Pollack ideas and personality traits that he could relate to while keeping the character's outlook reactionary.  For Fessenden, this demonstrated a common American outlook that he wanted to highlight as having to change to fit the needs a changing world.  Fessenden said the monsters are not to be taken literally and are "a manifestation within Hoffman's mind".<ref name=slant/>

When casting the film, Fessenden looked to recruit Perlman because of his gruff performance as the title character in ''[[Hellboy (2004 film)|Hellboy]]''.<ref name=slant/>  LeGros and Britton are actors that Fessenden enjoys, and he wanted to give them starring roles.<ref name=iw/>  Funding came from the Icelandic Film Commission and Katapult.  Shooting took place in both Iceland and Alaska.  Iceland was chosen because of the poor film infrastructure in Alaska, and Canada – the other obvious shooting location – was not flat or snowy enough.<ref name=slant/>  Fessenden credited shooting some scenes in Alaska with adding authenticity to the film and further inspiring him to make changes to the script as he scouted locations.<ref name=iw/>

== Release ==
''The Last Winter'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/winter-gets-ifcs-calendar-140095|title=''Winter'' gets on IFC's calendar|last=Goldstein|first=Gregg|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2007-06-22|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  The U.S. cable channel [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] had been supportive of Fessenden's career and often played his films.

== Reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 76% of 50 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.7/10.  The site's consensus reads: "''The Last Winter'' creatively and effectively uses horror tactics – fear, tension, anticipation, and just enough gore – to shock, but never repulse, its audience."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/last_winter/|title=The Last Winter (2007)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  [[Metacritic]] rated it 69/100 based on 17 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-last-winter|title=The Last Winter|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "an imperfect but compelling thriller" that returns to Fessenden's interest in character dynamics, atmosphere, and offbeat narrative ideas rather than genre cliches.<ref name=variety/>  [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' selected it as a "NYT Critics' Pick" and wrote that it "breathes fresh air into a stale setup", comparing it to the "elegantly restrained horror" of [[Val Lewton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/movies/19wint.html|title=That Red on White Is Blood on Snow|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-09-19|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>  In describing it as a traditional Gothic horror story, Carina Chocano of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that it "accomplishes with a modest budget and a talented cast what bigger, slicker, gorier contemporary horror movies rarely do".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/21/entertainment/et-winter21|title=''Last Winter'': Gothic horror rises in Arctic|last=Chocano|first=Carina|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2017-02-23}}</ref>
