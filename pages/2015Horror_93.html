== Synopsis ==
Nellie (Emma Smith) is a young orphan that has arrived at an orphanage run by Mrs. Pryor ([[Maria Olsen]]), a cruel woman who only sees the facility as a way to earn money. To make matters worse, the orphanage's maintenance man (Bill Townsend) appears to be even more depraved than she is. However, not all is bad, as Nellie is able to make a few friends, including Miss Lillian ([[Keri Maletto]]), who helps run the orphanage. However, as her stay lengthens, Nellie begins to realize that she may not leave the orphanage alive.

==Reception==
[[Dread Central]]'s review stated, "Flashes of brilliance from Lapisardi are observed with a few scenes where the kids were allowed to be kids when the evil Mrs. Pryor stepped away from the sightline, and how their happiness went swirling down the hopper when she returned – something so simply shot can result in a great scene of filmmaking, I don’t care how much (or how little) dough is dumped into the project. Alas, what could have been transformed into a straight-up mental twister of a thriller slides down that slippery crap-slope into useless violence in the hopes of reeling in the crowd, and that’s where I almost tuned out."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Gore Orphanage (2015) (review)|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/115346/gore-orphanage-2015/|website = Dread Central|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = en-US|last = Boiselle|first = Matt}}</ref>
