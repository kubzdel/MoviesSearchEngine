'''''Birdemic: Shock and Terror''''' (often shortened to '''''Birdemic''''') is a 2010 American [[Independent film|independent]] [[Romance film|romantic]] [[horror film]]<ref name = "BD">{{ cite web| url = http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18800 | title = Tim & Eric Host the Greatest Night of Your Life: World Premiere of 'Birdemic'!| work = [[Bloody Disgusting]]| date = January 21, 2010| accessdate = November 26, 2010}}</ref> written, directed, and produced by [[James Nguyen]], and starring Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore. Inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'', ''Birdemic'' tells the story of a romance between the two main characters as their small town is attacked by birds.

The film was largely self-financed and was produced through Nguyen's Moviehead Pictures company for a budget of less than $10,000. The film has gained notoriety for its poor quality, with many critics citing it as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films of all time]].<ref name="huffpo" /><ref name="slate" /> After a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]], the film gained a [[Cult film|cult following]] and was picked up for distribution by [[Severin Films]] in 2010.

==Plot==
Rod (Alan Bagh) is a young [[software]] [[salesman]] living a successful life in [[Silicon Valley]]. He meets up with old classmate and aspiring [[fashion model]] Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and begins dating her. Things go well for the couple, with Rod receiving a large bonus that he uses to start his own business, while Nathalie is chosen as a [[Victoria's Secret]] model. As they grow closer, the couple remains oblivious to signs of something going wrong around them, such as unexplained wildfires and the carcasses of diseased birds turning up on beaches.

After consummating their relationship in a motel, Rod and Nathalie wake up to find that their town is under attack from [[eagle]]s and [[vultures]]. The birds spit acid and explode into flames upon striking the ground. (On the DVD commentary, the director explained that was because they became mutated and toxic due to [[global warming]].<ref name="Birdemic DVD Commentary">Birdemic DVD Commentary</ref>) Rod and Nathalie escape from the motel by joining up with an ex-[[marine (military)|Marine]] named Ramsey (Adam Sessa) and his girlfriend Becky (Catherine Batcha). As they leave town, they rescue two young children, Susan (Janae Caster) and Tony (Colton Osborne), whose parents have been killed by the birds.

The group proceeds to drive from one town to the next, fending off more bird attacks along the way and briefly meeting a scientist named Dr. Jones (Rick Camp) studying the phenomenon. Becky is killed by the birds. Ramsey tries to save a busload of tourists. As they leave the bus, Ramsey and the tourists are killed by acid that is dropped by the birds. Nathalie stops Rod from attempting to rescue Ramsey because she fears the birds will kill him, too.

Rod, Nathalie and the kids continue to flee from the birds, driving into a forest where they briefly meet a "[[environmentalist|Tree Hugger]]" named Tom Hill (Stephen Gustavson), who talks to them about the dangers of global warming. (On the DVD commentary, the director explained that the birds were attacking people in retaliation for global warming, and that they were targeting gas stations and cars, since they burn carbon dioxide [sic].<ref name="Birdemic DVD Commentary"/>) After escaping a forest fire, the quartet ultimately settles on a small beach, where Rod fishes for dinner. As they prepare to eat, they are attacked by the birds, but then [[doves]] appear and all the birds leave in peace. The film ends as Rod, Nathalie and the kids watch the birds fly off into the horizon.

==Production==
[[File:Birdemic bus.jpg|thumb|right|A bus featured in one sequence.]]
Nguyen was inspired to write the script for ''Birdemic: Shock and Terror'' while spending time relaxing in [[Half Moon Bay]], [[California]],<ref name="int2">{{cite web | url = http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19437 | title = Video Interview with 'Birdemic' Director Part 2, New York Premiere Announced! | date = May 11, 2010 | accessdate = June 17, 2010 | work = [[Bloody Disgusting]]}}</ref> and much of the filming took place in the area surrounding the community. ''Birdemic'' began production in 2006 and took four years to produce,<ref>{{cite web |last=Riley |first=Jenelle |title=For the Birds |url=http://www.backstage.com/bso/news-and-features-features/for-the-birds-1004077669.story |publisher=Backstage |date=23 March 2010 |access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref> partly due to time limitations—filming was done mostly on weekends over the course of seven months<ref name="howdidthisgetmade">[http://www.earwolf.com/episode/birdemic-shock-and-terror-live/ Birdemic: LIVE!, episode #31 of How Did This Get Made]</ref>—and also due to financial restraints, as it was financed through Nguyen's day job, plus the time it took for Nguyen to find a distributor.

The movie was also inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 film ''The Birds.'' ''The Birds'' starred actress [[Tippi Hedren]], who appeared in Nguyen's earlier film ''Julie and Jack.'' ''Birdemic'' includes footage of that appearance, playing on a television.

The movie contains several anti-war statements. On the DVD commentary, the director explained that one early inspiration for the movie was the anti-war movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', and that at the end of the movie the birds stopped their attack because they wanted to have peace, and to give humans a second chance to help the environment. He said that as production continued, he became more influenced by [[Al Gore]]'s movie ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' which is about global warming. The movie was one of several in an uptick of bird horror films inspired by Hitchcock's movie, beginning in 2007 with ''[[Kaw  (film)|Kaw]]'' and continuing with ''[[Flu Bird Horror]]'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Animal Horror Cinema: Genre, History and Criticism|editor1-last=Gregersdotter|editor1-first=Katarina|editor2-last=Höglund|editor2-first=Johan|editor3-last=Hållén|editor3-first=Nicklas|chapter=A History of Animal Horror Cinema|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-1-137-49639-3|page=29||last1=Gregersdotter|first1=Katarina|last3=Höglund|first3=Johan|last2=Hållén|first2=Nicklas|doi=10.1057/9781137496393_2|date=2015}}</ref>

During filming of ''Birdemic'', Nguyen instructed star Whitney Moore not to socialize with her costar Alan Bagh after filming. On the commentary, Moore said they didn't get permits to film at specific locations, instead just showing up, and sometimes getting kicked out. She said that at one point, they were filming on a public jogging trail, and Nguyen started yelling at joggers who were getting in the shot. Moore told him not to yell at people who weren't associated with the film, and he responded by refusing to talk to her for three weeks. He gave her direction using her costar Bagh as an intermediary.<ref name="Birdemic DVD Commentary"/>

The film was produced with a budget of $10,000, but the distributors have spent more on marketing than it cost to produce the film and purchase the rights.<ref name = "bbc">{{cite video | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8604858.stm | title = BBC:Is Birdemic worst film ever made? | date = April 6, 2010 | accessdate = November 26, 2010 | publisher = [[BBC News]]}}</ref> There weren't a lot of crew members on the movie, and the actors performed many of the roles that would normally be performed by crew members. They often held their own microphones, sometimes between their knees. Moore was in charge of the makeup, after the first two makeup women quit. The film uses fake names for crew members in the credits, in order to appear more legitimate.<ref name="Birdemic DVD Commentary"/>

On April 3, 2009, Moviehead Pictures self-released ''Birdemic'' on DVD, selling it exclusively through Moviehead's official website and manufactured on demand through [[Amazon.com]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/BIRDEMIC-Whitney-Caster-Colton-Osborne/dp/B0024NL906 'Birdemic: Shock and Terror' on Amazon]</ref> In early 2010, ''Birdemic'' was picked up by [[Severin Films]]<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35643/birdemic-flies-its-way-theaters Birdemic Flies Its Way to Theaters!]</ref> with plans to release the film on home media. ''Birdemic'' was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on February 22, 2011. The DVD's special features include an audio commentary by James Nguyen as well as one by lead actors Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, two deleted scenes, a feature on the Birdemic Experience Tour, and an episode of the public-access San Francisco TV show ''Movie Close Up'' which features Nguyen and was aired as ''Birdemic'' was still under production (the host of the show, Bonnie Steiger, later played an extra in the bus rescue scene of ''Birdemic'').

==Reception==
''Birdemic'' has been noted for its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting and dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and, in particular, its special effects, consisting entirely of poorly rendered [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] eagles and vultures that, in addition to performing physically awkward aerial maneuvers (non-animated bird [[Sprites (computer graphics)|sprites]] in the background will simply rotate 360° in mid-air), spit acid and explode with unrealistic smoke upon impact with the ground with a plane dive sound effect.<ref name="Demon">Morbid. [http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/12/18/birdemic/ 'Birdemic: Shock and Terror'] www.dreamindemon.com. December 18, 2009.</ref> It has also been noted that the birds do not appear until nearly halfway (47 minutes) into the film.

On a 2009 "Best of" list, [[Bloody Disgusting]] listed ''Birdemic'' amongst its honorable mentions, calling it "the best worst film you'll see in 2010".<ref>Massacre, Tex.
