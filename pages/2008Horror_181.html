== Reception ==

[[Bloody Disgusting]] gave ''Sight'' a 1½ out of 5, the website's primary criticisms of the film being the muddled plot, and the sound quality.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/111799/sight-v-2/|title = ''Sight'' (V)|last = |first = |publisher = Bloody Disgusting|date = 13 November 2008|website = bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate = 27 December 2014}} </ref> A ½ was awarded by Steve Barton of [[Dread Central]], who succinctly stated, "The only constructive thing I can say about this dark, dreary, time-consuming, black hole of a film is that it was less than an hour and a half long and had some okay sound design".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/7150/sight-dvd/|title = ''Sight'' (DVD)|last = Barton|first = Steve|publisher = Dread Central|date = 16 May 2008|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 27 December 2014}} </ref> [[DVD Talk]]'s Justin Felix, who gave the film a 2½ out of 5, said, "Acting aside, ''Sight'' is ultimately a worthwhile low budget exercise in eerie mood and spectral scares, though I'm not sure it warrants repeat viewings".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33114/sight/|title = ''Sight''|last = Felix|first = Justin|publisher = DVD Talk|date = 20 May 2008|website = dvdtalk.com|accessdate = 27 December 2014}} </ref> The film was deemed "slightly annoying" in a review for [[DVD Verdict]] written by David Johnson, who concluded his coverage of ''Sight'' with, "A well-acted horror film that relies too heavily on the jump scare and a twist ending that fails to wow, ''Sight'' probably isn't worth taking a look at".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/sight.php|title = ''Sight''|last = Johnson|first = David|publisher = DVD Verdict|date = 9 May 2008|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 27 December 2014}} </ref>
