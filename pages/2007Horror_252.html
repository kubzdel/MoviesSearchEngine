== Reception ==
Scott Foy of [[Dread Central]] rated the film 3/5 stars and called it "a fun little piece of pulp action horror – a modern day drive-in movie, breezy and cheesy, but done so with an unmistakable enthusiasm."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/zombie-wars-2008|title=Zombie Wars (2008)|last=Foy|first=Scott|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2008-02-22|accessdate=2013-12-02}}</ref>  David Walker of [[DVD Talk]] rated the film 1/5 stars and said, "''Zombie Wars'' is not a terrible film in the sense that it is not completely unwatchable. It is, however, a terrible film in that the script is bad, the direction is lackluster, the acting is marginal and the premise, which has hints of ''Planet of the Apes'', is laughable in its execution."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/33923/zombie-wars/|title=Zombie Wars|last=Walker|first=David|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2008-07-16|accessdate=2013-12-02}}</ref>  [[Peter Dendle]] wrote that the film is "conceptually ambitious" but dragged down by its poor writing, acting, and production values.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia: Volume 2, 2000-2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=McFarland Publishing|year=2012|isbn=9780786461639|pages=232–233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMFGJbVpumQC&pg=PA232}}</ref>
