'''''Satan's Playground''''', also known as '''''Chemistry''''', is a 2006 American [[horror film]] directed and written by [[Dante Tomaselli]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Heading to ''Satan's Playground'' with Dante Tomaselli|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3163442/heading-to-satan-s-playground-with-dante-tomaselli/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref> The film stars [[Felissa Rose]], [[Ellen Sandweiss]], and [[Edwin Neal]]. 

This was Sandweiss' first film appearance since 1981's ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', and was the first time Tomaselli did not serve as the producer of his own film.

== Plot==
Donna ([[Felissa Rose]]) and Frank (Salvatore Paul Piro) Bruno have decided to take a trip into the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|Pine Barrens]] with their autistic son Sean ([[Danny Lopes]]), new mother Paula ([[Ellen Sandweiss]]), and her baby Anthony (Marco Rose). When their car breaks down in the middle of the forest Frank goes off to find help and comes across the house of Mrs. Leeds (Irma St. Paule), a palm reader that lives there with her mute daughter Judy (Christie Sanford) and her son. Mrs. Leeds rushes him into the house, insisting that the [[Jersey Devil]] lives in the forest. However, despite her concern, it soon becomes apparent that her family is just as dangerous when Judy murders Frank.

One by one the people remaining in the car go out to search for their lost family members. Donna goes off in search of Frank and is assaulted and captured by the Leeds. Sean wanders off and gets lost in the woods. Paula initially tries to stay in the car and keep her baby safe, but inevitably leaves the car to investigate a police cruiser. However rather than containing help, it contains the corpse of an officer killed by the Jersey Devil. When she returns to the car she finds that Anthony has been taken and she goes off in search of him, which takes her to the Leeds house, where she's killed by the Leeds. Sean eventually makes it to the Leeds house where he is given a palm reading and then sent back into the night, where he gets sucked underground by what appears to be [[quicksand]]. This leaves only Donna alive, who manages to escape by bribing the Leeds son with [[diazepam]]. She eventually makes it to safety and wakes up in a hospital bed, where she is told that the Leeds house has been abandoned for years. Donna manages to persuade the police to check out the Leeds house in the hopes of finding Anthony, only for the Leeds to murder the police officer accompanying her. Terrified, Donna flees the house and tries to once again make it to safety, but is then killed by the Jersey Devil.
