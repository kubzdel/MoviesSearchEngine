== Plot ==

On Halloween in 1999, young [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] donned a clown mask and stabbed his older sister [[List of Halloween characters#Judith Myers|Judith]] (who had just had sex with her boyfriend) to death in their suburban home in Haddonfield, Illinois. Michael was sent to an asylum in the nearby [[Bellevue, Illinois|Bellevue]], and placed under the care of Doctor [[Samuel Loomis]]. On the fifteenth anniversary of Judith's death, Michael escapes by hijacking one of the institution's vehicles, returns to his old home, and spies on [[Laurie Strode]] as she drops off the house's keys at the behest of her realtor father.

Ignoring a colleague's orders to let the authorities deal with Michael, Loomis (after receiving fellatio from a nurse, an impulsive act he blames on "the evil") follows Michael to Haddonfield, and teams-up with the town's sheriff, [[List of Halloween characters#Sheriff Leigh Brackett|Leigh Brackett]]. While Loomis and Brackett discuss how to deal with the situation outside the Myers house, Michael (who has acquired a white mask) stalks Laurie and her friends [[List of Halloween characters#Lynda Van Der Klok|Lynda]] and [[List of Halloween characters#Annie Brackett|Annie]], following the latter home. Annie mistakes Michael for her boyfriend, [[Rape by deception|has sex with him]], and is murdered. Lynda and her boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Bob Simms|Bob]] then stop by, and have sex in one of the bedrooms. When the two finish, Michael attacks them, stabbing Bob, and strangling Lynda.

Worried because Annie, Lynda and Bob are not answering her calls, Laurie goes over to Annie's house, and finds her friends' bodies. Frightened, Laurie runs back home, and is followed by Michael, but she evades the maniac long enough for Loomis to appear and shoot him several times. Michael disappears after being shot, and while Loomis goes off in search of him, Sheriff Brackett stays behind to guard Laurie while she takes a shower (it being implied she soiled herself out of fear). Once cleaned up, Laurie approaches the sheriff, and convinces him to sleep with her, having decided it is high time she lost her virginity. Post-coitus, Laurie grabs a hidden knife, and the film ends as she attacks the sheriff with it.
