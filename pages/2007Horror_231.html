'''''Unearthed''''' is a 2007 [[horror film]], directed by [[Matthew Leutwyler]] (''[[Dead & Breakfast]]'') and starring [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] (''[[Saw II]]'') and [[Luke Goss]]. This monster movie opened on November 9, 2007 as one of the "[[8 Films to Die For]]" in the [[After Dark Films]] Horrorfest.

==Plot==
After a sinister crash on the highway in a small New Mexican town, people start disappearing and animals begin dying. The cause of the crash is later revealed to be a 900-year-old creature which was unearthed during an archaeological dig in the area.

Meanwhile, a gas station owner informs a group of people that the gas tank never arrived, which meant that the small group needed to spend the night at the gas station. Sheriff Annie is called to investigate the crash, and finds a strange piece of evidence.

Annie then takes it to the gas station, where Nodin investigates it. It is clearly not human, and has many elements of DNA in it. It is later explained the creature is an alien weapon, devised by an extremely ancient civilization to collect DNA like some kind of probe or exploration device created using bio-technology, however it tends to do so in a decidedly lethal manner.

At the bar, Carla finds male customers dead in the back lot. She runs back into the bar, and the creature then breaks in. It first injures her arm (and also causes her to shoot herself in the foot), and then it eventually butchers her.

Back at the gas station, Caya and Charlie are flirting inside the motel room. Ally goes outside to throw out some garbage, and encounters Grandpa, thinking Ally was a coyote rustling through the trash. Ally then returns to the motel, but before she can enter, the creature rips its claw into her torso.

Ally's dead body is thrown back into the room and onto the stove. Her dead body burns, causing a fire, and a gas leak. Annie, Nodin, and Grandpa go into the room where the creature is outside banging on the walls. Grandpa is then killed, and Nodin begins to panic.

Annie then knocks her unconscious and they go out to the truck, after the room explodes into flames.

After battling the monster countlessly, most of the group is killed. At the end, Annie confronts the monster, and believes she kills it by smashing it against a water tank with her car but the monster was only made unconscious for a while. Annie injects herself with the poison containing uranium (the only substance that makes the poison work against the monster) that was prepared by Nodin in order to kill the monster. The monster kills Annie and dies itself as soon as it comes in contact with the uranium in the poison. The remaining survivors, Caya and Nodin, place Annie's body in the back of their truck. They then drive off, leaving the monster in the dirt, where it is most likely going to become buried again.
