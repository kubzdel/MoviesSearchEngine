Based on the horrific true story of the 1996 Vampire Killings in Florida,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Crime Library]]|title=The Vampire Killers|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/8.html}}</ref> the film follows the police investigation of five Goth teenagers who claimed to be real-life vampires. They drank each other's blood and embraced the occult. But they were also ordinary, middle-class kids looking for an outlet for their angst and morbid curiosity. Somewhere along their road trip to New Orleans, their fantasy life became all too real. Now the police have two savagely beaten corpses on their hands—parents of the teenaged vampires. What really happened? And how did these normal kids become such monsters?

I just couldn’t find an anchor to the story and I truly, and I mean TRULY, despised the characters in it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Vampire Clan (review)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/vampire-clan|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> ''Variety'' panned the movie, writing "From its ripped-from-the-headlines topic of teen bloodsuckers to the blandness of a low-budgeter shockingly low on shocks, true story of the murder of a family is translated by scripter Aaron Pope into a woefully standard depiction of wayward youth."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Koehler|first1=Robert|title=Review: ‘Vampire Clan’|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/reviews/vampire-clan-1200546547/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref>
