== Plot ==
<!-- Keep the plot to 400-700 words per WP:PLOTSUMMARIZE -->
[[List of Resident Evil characters#James Marcus|Dr. James Marcus]], the original founder of the Umbrella Corporation, had a daughter who was dying of [[Progeria|premature aging]]. Desperate to save her, Marcus discovered the T-virus. Unfortunately, the virus had the side effect of sudden and uncontrollable mutation; in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], a boy dies in a cable car ascending to [[Table Mountain]], then reanimates and kills the other passengers. Marcus tried to have the program shut down, despite protests from his colleague Dr. Alexander Isaacs ([[Iain Glen]]). When Marcus refused, Isaacs ordered Albert Wesker to kill him. The Red Queen is then created using childhood images of Marcus' daughter.

Some time after the events of [[Resident Evil: Retribution|the previous film]], Alice awakens in the now-ruined [[White House]] after being betrayed once again by Wesker. While she is searching for survivors, the Red Queen appears and tells Alice she must return to the Hive, over 400 miles west on [[I-64]] in Raccoon City, within 48 hours. The Umbrella Corporation has developed an airborne antivirus, which can kill every organism infected by the T-virus (which may or may not include Alice), and is just waiting for the remaining few thousand humans to be wiped out. When asked why she is betraying her creators, the Red Queen says that she will explain once Alice arrives at the Hive.

On her way to Raccoon City, Alice is captured by Isaacs—learning the one she [[Resident Evil: Extinction|previously killed]] was just a clone—though she manages to escape his convoy. Alice later arrives in Raccoon City and is ambushed by a group of survivors, consisting of Doc, Abigail, Christian, Cobalt, Razor, and Alice's friend [[Claire Redfield]], who survived the [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|attack on Arcadia]]. With Isaacs' convoy approaching, trailed by a horde of zombies, the group prepares for battle. They defeat the convoy, retrieve Isaacs' few human captives and burn the horde, though Cobalt is killed. With more undead on the way and no defenses left, Alice and crew head for the Hive entrance, located at the bottom of the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|crater from the nuclear bomb]] dropped on the city. Wesker, having taken control of the Hive, releases mutated guard dogs, killing Christian and a freed captive.

Inside the Hive, the Red Queen appears to Alice and explains her reason for betraying Umbrella. She reveals that a video was uploaded to her program which contained the recording of Isaacs explaining to Umbrella's executives the plan to release the T-virus, cleansing the world of man-made catastrophes while saving the rich and powerful in cryogenic capsules hidden in the Hive, and later rebuild the world in their image. The Red Queen program is in conflict, as she can never hurt an Umbrella employee but also must value remaining human life, which is why she enlists Alice's help in order to stop Isaacs. Before proceeding onwards, Alice is silently warned by the Red Queen that someone in her group is a spy for Umbrella.

Navigating the Hive, the group encounter several traps, resulting in the deaths of Abigail and Razor along with the remaining freed captive. Alice and Doc plant bombs throughout the Hive taken from the leftover equipment [[Resident Evil (film)|of the original team to investigate the Hive]]. Alice confronts the real (tech-upgraded) Isaacs, whereupon she is held at gunpoint by Doc—Umbrella's spy—while Claire is captured by Wesker. A cryogenic capsule opens, releasing Alicia Marcus, Umbrella's co-leader and Marcus' daughter. Isaacs reveals to Alice that she is actually a clone of Alicia, before going on to explain his plan in eliminating the pair so that he can assume full control of Umbrella. Though Isaacs is the co-founder of Umbrella, Alicia points out that Wesker is merely an employee and proceeds to "fire" him, allowing the Red Queen to crush his legs with a security door. Doc tries to shoot Alice, but he finds his gun empty—as Alice had earlier deduced his treachery—and Claire executes him. After giving Wesker the [[deadman's switch]] to the bombs she planted, Alice and Claire pursue Isaacs while Alicia willingly stays behind to review her childhood memories with her father.

Upon catching up to Isaacs, Alice and Claire fight him as the trio are lifted back up to the Hive.  Isaacs overpowers Claire and attacks Alice in the Laser Corridor.  Alice manages to dodge the lasers before re-engaging Isaacs, eventually beating him when she secretly activates a grenade in his pocket.  She escapes to the surface with the antivirus, but Isaacs reboots and follows; he catches her just as she's about to release the antivirus.  Before he can kill Alice, however, Isaacs is confronted and instantly killed by his clone, which Alice encountered ''en route'' to Raccoon City; the clone is then devoured by the undead.  The distraction allows Alice to release the antivirus, killing all of the undead around her before she passes out.  Wesker simultaneously drops the deadman's switch, destroying the Hive along with the hibernating Umbrella elite; Alicia and Wesker are killed in the process.

Claire wakes Alice, who survived because the antivirus killed only the T-virus within her body, not the healthy cells.  The Red Queen gives Alice an upload of all of Alicia's memories, granting her a childhood.  Alice travels into [[Manhattan]], saying that the antivirus, carried only by the winds, will take years to reach all corners of the globe.  Until then, says Alice, her mission is not finished.

Despite the film being trimmed by 7 minutes, totaling only 99 minutes, likely thanks to the violence-intolerant [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fergus|first1=Ryan|title=China Censors Slash Resident Evil Final Chapter|url=http://chinafilminsider.com/china-censors-slash-resident-evil/|website=China Film Insider|accessdate=11 June 2017}}</ref> the film opened on February 24, 2017, in China across 11,000 screens, earning $30 million on its opening day. Through its opening weekend, the film made 636.9 million yuan ($92.7 million). This marks the biggest Friday-through-Sunday debut ever for an imported film, topping such heavyweights as ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]'' (632 million yuan) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (628 million yuan) and the second-biggest for all films, behind only ''[[Lost in Thailand]]''.<ref name="CFI3"/>

However, figures varied slightly by different outlets—Shanghai-based cinema consulting firm Artisan Gateway had its opening weekend at $93.9 million while the film's studio, Sony Pictures came in even higher with $94.3 million.<ref name="CFI3">{{cite web|url=http://chinafilminsider.com/china-box-office-evil-takes-up-residence/|title=China Box Office: Evil Takes Up Residence, Sets New Precedent|author=Jonathan Papish|work=China Film Insider|date=February 28, 2017|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref>

===Critical response===
''Resident Evil: The Final Chapter'' received mixed reviews from critics.<ref name="reviews">{{cite web |url=http://wwg.com/2017/01/27/resident-evil-the-final-chapter-review-roundup/ |title=Resident Evil: The Final Chapter Review Roundup |website=WWG.com |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref> On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 36% based on 91 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Resident Evil: The Final Chapter'' may prove mind-numbingly chaotic for the unconverted, but for fans of the venerable franchise, it offers a fittingly kinetic conclusion to its violent post-apocalyptic saga".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_the_final_chapter |title= Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2017) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score 49 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil-the-final-chapter |title=Resident Evil: The Final Chapter Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Alex Welch of [[IGN]] was critical of the film, giving 3/10 and calling it "a pointless mess from beginning to end", and "nothing more than a barrage of cliched character beats, unbearable CGI action, and headache-inducing editing".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Welch|first1=Alex|title=Resident Evil: The Final Chapter Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/27/resident-evil-the-final-chapter-review|accessdate=27 January 2017|publisher=IGN|date=27 January 2017}}</ref> [[Glenn Kenny]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes, "This is, I think, the weakest picture in the franchise".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kenny Glenn|first1=Glenn|title=Review: Alice Returns in ‘Resident Evil: The Final Chapter’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/movies/resident-evil-review-the-final-chapter.html?_r=0|accessdate=27 January 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 January 2017}}</ref>

The decision not to bring back surviving characters from the previous films - notably Jill, Leon and Ada - was a particular draw for criticism, with many voicing disappointment over a lack of closure for said characters and a sense of anti-climax following the cliff-hanger ending of the previous movie that had implied their inclusion in a follow-up.<ref name="Resident Evil: The Final Chapter movie review">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/resident-evil-the-final-chapter-movie-review/ |title=Resident Evil: The Final Chapter Movie Review |work=Digital Trends |date=27 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="Review: Resident Evil: The Final Chapter">{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3422360/review-resident-evil-the-final-chapter-fitting-conclusion-made-fans/ |title=[Review] Resident Evil: The Final Chapter |work=Bloody Disgusting|date=27 January 2017}}</ref><ref name="Review: 'Resident Evil: The Final Chapter' Is A Disappointing Series Finale">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/01/27/review-resident-evil-the-final-chapter-is-a-disappointing-series-finale/#2c3f797c5b18 |title=Review: 'Resident Evil: The Final Chapter' Is A Disappointing Series Finale |work=Forbes|date=27 January 2017}}</ref>

In contrast, Bill Zwecker of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying it "[gets] the storyline right off the bat". He adds, "For fans of ''[[Resident Evil (film series)|Resident Evil]],'' I believe this final film will not disappoint, but it also will likely encourage newcomers to the saga to go back and play a bit of catch-up by watching the earlier movies".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zwecker|first1=Bill|title=Like the zombies, ‘Resident Evil’ finale keeps moving forward|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/like-the-zombies-resident-evil-finale-keeps-moving-forward/|accessdate=27 January 2017|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=26 January 2017}}</ref>
