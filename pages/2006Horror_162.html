Roommates Yoo-jin, Eun-soo, Bo-ram, and Da-young are cramming for a college entrance exam. It's difficult for them to adapt to the stifling atmosphere of the all female lodging institute and to get along with each other, due to their differing personalities. Yoo-jin has the most difficulty with the stuffy institute life. She begins to have visions of events that took place at the institute in the past, such as the tragic fire that occurred years ago. Yoo-jin gradually becomes consumed with fear, and the relationship among the four begins to suffer with dangerous results.
