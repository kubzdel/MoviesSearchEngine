'''''InAlienable''''' is a 2008 [[science fiction film]] with [[Horror film|horror]] and comic elements, written and executive produced by [[Walter Koenig]], and directed by Robert Dyke. It was the first collaboration of Koenig and Dyke since their 1989 production of ''[[Moontrap]]''. Koenig said that "the story really involves that relationship between the human being and the alien. At first, it's assumed that the alien [is] a parasite growing in a host, but because it has some of the human DNA, it's significantly more than that. Even though it comes from another world, it's a part of our world. Really, it's a love story."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_action=doc&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=AWNB&p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%2011980E49509D1510%20)&p_docid=11980E49509D1510&p_theme=aggdocs&p_queryname=11980E49509D1510&f_openurl=yes&p_nbid=Q60M49QHMTM1OTAzNTkzOS40ODA2OTg6MToxMjoxNjkuMTM5LjE5LjA&&p_multi=MDTB |author= Wildsmith, Steve |title= WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE: 'Trek' actor tries hand at writing, producing and starring in new sci-fi film |location= Maryville, Tenn. |newspaper= The Daily Times |date= May 31, 2007 |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref>

==Plot==

Dr. Eric Norris remains wracked with guilt after a terrible tragedy that cost him his family, and when he learns that an alien parasite is not only growing inside him but shares his DNA, he develops a fiercely paternal bond with the creature. The alien "might regenerate into a surrogate son to replace his own child who was lost years earlier."<ref>{{cite journal |author= Latchem, John |title= InAlienable |journal= [[Home Media Magazine]] |volume= 31 |number= 47 |date= Nov 23, 2009 |page= 18}}</ref> Koenig plays the [[antagonist]], a scientific research institute administrator who dislikes Norris because he had been mutually in love with Norris's wife, who died; he blames Norris for his own now bleak life and enjoys insulting him. Norris, new love interest Amanda, and attorney Howard Ellis must defend the new child, Benjamin, from being imprisoned by government forces or, worse, destroyed. The courtroom trial covers such issues as [[habeas corpus]] and [[miscegenation]].

At first horrified by the growth within him, Eric Norris comes to love the child that he "gives birth to" and names Benjamin. When a court trial begins to take Benjamin away from him, all sorts of arguments are raised about the real meaning of the word "alien." A disturbed man, Emil ([[Andrew Koenig]], Walter Koenig's son), brings a gun into the courtroom and shoots Benjamin, to the loss of all concerned.

== Production ==
The screenplay was written by Walter Koenig of the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series. He told ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' magazine that he was watching the [[2000 World Series]] with friends, one of whom had appeared in ''[[The Blob]]''. "We proceeded to have other conversations along the way about making a film that, at least initially, began the same way as ''The Blob'', with something landing from outer space. And I really took it from there."<ref name= "Star">{{cite web |url= http://www.mediabistro.com/portfolios/samples_files/VlCeeZ0pGReK3by0RwcbEUQw7.pdf |author= Waldon, Dave |title= ''Star Trek'' star Walter Koenig discusses his new TV movie ''InAlienable'', along with his fellow cast and crew |date= January 2008 |publisher= ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref> He told interviewer Chris Wood (who identifies the friend as Anthony Franke), "I wanted to examine the intensity of [[Paternal bond|familial bonding]]. That was one thing. I also wanted to explore the concept of [[Civil and political rights|civil]] and [[human rights]]. But the actual event that sat me down at the computer was when two friends of mine who didn't know each other joined me to watch the New York Yankees play in the World Series back in 2001. My friend Tony Franke had been in the original film of ''The Blob'' (1958) and Sky Conway had always been a big fan of the movie. Inspired by Tony's stories, Sky confessed to always wanting to shoot a film about a meteor landing with an alien presence aboard. I holed myself up in my room and took it from there."<ref name= "Pyke">{{cite web |url= http://subspacecommunique.com/node/679 |author= Wood, Chris (as Captain Pyke) |title= Walter Koenig's "InAlienable" Heading To DVD Plus Interview |publisher= Subspace Communiqué: Trek Culture Served Daily |date= February 1, 2010 |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref>

It took Koenig a decade to bring the film to fruition.<ref name= "Pyke" /> He initially wrote the lead role for himself, but reevaluated his view "that the audience would buy me as a romantic interest", and offered it to ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'s'' Richard Hatch.<ref name=screenstar>[http://www.screenstar.com/News/Article/453 Interview: Walter Koenig (Writer/Producer of ''InAlienable'')], ScreenStar movie news</ref> He also considered playing attorney Ellis: "In retrospect, I might have had a great deal of fun playing the lawyer — which, I have to admit, Erick Avari so brilliantly played — but I love comedy and I think maybe I could've brought something to it."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.yesweekly.com/triad/article-8434-walter-koenig-explores-a-new-frontier-in-inalienable.html |author= Burger, Mark |title= Walter Koenig explores a new frontier in ''InAlienable'' |newspaper= [[Yes!

Hatch talked about why he accepted the role: "It was very character-driven. It was about
people and relationships. It wasn't [just] about some monster or strange creature; it was
about human beings having to deal with very morally conflicted situations. I wasn't
choosing ''InAlienable'' because it was a science-fiction piece, although I love science
fiction. I was choosing it, as I choose any movie that I go watch, because it was about
something meaningful. It was about real people having to struggle with issues that all of
us have to face in our lives."<ref name= "Star" />

Marina Sirtis of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and other familiar actors from sci-fi franchises were also willing to participate. Koenig's wife, son and daughter had roles on screen.<ref name=screenstar/>

It was shot on location in [[Southern California]]. It is the first feature film made by Renegade Studios, and was released over the internet on a [[pay-per-view]] basis.<ref name=prweb>[http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/11/prweb568399.htm "InAlienable" Set for Release], PRWeb,com, November 12, 2007</ref>

The film's debut public screening was cut short by Koenig, as the visual quality on the screen at ''Conglomeration! 2008'' was not up to his standards.<ref>''Reporter-Times'', Martinsville & Morgan County, Indiana.

==Release==
This [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] film made its debut on the Internet on a [[pay-per-view]] basis; it premiered online on December 15, 2008 with a nominal $2.99 fee charged for watching it.<ref name= "Star" />

==Cultural allusions==
* ''[[The X-Files]]'' - Shilling says, "Norris's friend found a foreign organism attached to a piece of the meteor, and he gave it to him. According to what Norris told him, the thing has gotten inside of him and is growing at an accelerated pace. Norris believes that it is some sort of alien parasite that's determined to free itself and, in the process, kill him."  Gerhard, a government scientist, wonders, "Didn't I see this on ''X-Files''?"
* Attorney Ellis says to Amanda, "I know there're aliens out there. At least, I'm pretty sure there're aliens out there. I mean, how else would you explain [[Andy Kaufman]] or [[Jim Carrey]]?"
* [[Newspaper]]s - Ellis, advising a letter-writing campaign to protect Benjamin, urges, "Avoid the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] at all costs. Especially ''The World'', ''[[Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'', and that rag, ''The Star''." While Koenig likely was using typical tabloid-type titles, ''The World'' might refer to ''[[News of the World]]'' or ''[[World (magazine)|World]]'', and ''The Star'' likely refers to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s ''[[Star (magazine)|The Star]]''. In the same conversation, Ellis refers to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 
* [[Nazism]] or [[Totalitarianism]] - Ellis asks the judge, "Would anyone dare suggest that the United States government has the right to detain, to conduct experiments on, and deprive a child the love and comfort of a parent just because he's different? What does that sound like to you, your Honor? Do I have to [[Jackboot#As an allegory|click my boots]] to make the point?"
* [[Joseph Merrick|The Elephant Man]] - Attorney Barry argues in court that "the Elephant Man was a human being... This creature is not a human being, not even remotely."
* ''[[Ozymandias]]'' - Attorney Barry quotes [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s poem in court: "Would you want this thing crawling around out there? Would you want this thing marry your families? [[Ozymandias|Look on my work, you mighty, and despair!]]"

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. Review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' summary, taken from Jason Buchanan of [[Rovi Corporation|Rovi]], declared: "A thought-provoking sci-fi drama headed up by a stellar cast, ''InAlienable'' tells the tale of a successful researcher who gives birth to an extraterrestrial child, and wages a passionate fight to defend his offspring from society and government scientists."<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inalienable_2009/#audience_reviews</ref>

The website Brutal As Hell wrote that the movie is "a film cheesier than a Kraft dairy farm and far more likable than it has any right to be," while faulting it for being "preachy, corny and overlong, with a shameless heart-string yanking climax."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.brutalashell.com/2010/02/dvd-review-inalienable/ |author= Riordan, Annie |title= DVD Review: InAlienable |date= February 14, 2010 |publisher= Brutalashell.com |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'' wrote, "Like an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', the story veers from expectations, merging traditional sci-fi motifs with the framework of a conventional [[Legal drama|courtroom drama]]... It's more thought-provoking than typical [[B movie|'B'-movie]] fare, even if the proceedings are a bit hackneyed."<ref>{{cite journal |author= Latchem, John |title= InAlienable |journal= [[Home Media Magazine]] |volume= 32 |number= 4 |date= January 25, 2010 |page= 20}}</ref> ''[[Dreamwatch|Total Sci-Fi Online]]'' granted only 1 star out of 10, saying, "At the core of ''InAlienable'' is an idea around which a terrific movie could be made, but unfortunately this isn't it."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://totalscifionline.com/reviews/4539-inalienable |author= Holm, Patrick |title= InAlienable |date= 20 January 2010 |publisher= ''[[Dreamwatch|Total Sci-Fi Online]]''|accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref> The website [[DVD Verdict]] wrote, "A courtroom thriller masquerading as a sci-fi drama, ''InAlienable'' is an intriguing effort with higher acting caliber than one might expect... ''InAlienable'' is far from groundbreaking cinema, but Koenig plays around with a lot of interesting ideas and themes. Not only does he play the slimy Schilling with tang, he also builds up his story well, keeping us hooked most of the way... What anchors the film is Hatch's powerful performance, but Peldon also makes a strong impression as his partner and lover."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/inalienable.php |author= Kulik, Christopher |date= January 26, 2010 |title= InAlienable |publisher= [[DVD Verdict]] |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref>
