==Plot==
In 1348 in a plague-ridden medieval England, Osmund, a young monk, is in love despite his vows with a girl named Averill, who tells him that when she leaves the monastery to escape the disease, she will wait for him for one week at a meeting place in the forest so they can run away together. Shortly after, a group of mercenaries led by the knight Ulric arrives and takes Osmund as a guide on a quest in the forest, which Ulric later reveals to be a search for a remote marshland village which has remained untouched by the Black Death, and is said to sacrifice people in order to remain free of the plague and to be led by a [[necromancer]] whom the group intends to bring back to the Bishop.

On the way to the village, Osmund leaves the group while they are sleeping to meet with Averill at their meeting spot, but only finds her horse and torn blood-stained clothing. The group is attacked by bandits, resulting in Osmund being severely wounded, and ultimately find the village, an eerie disease-free utopia led by a beautiful woman, Langiva. Pretending to seek shelter to draw the necromancer out, the group grows suspicious of the villagers, as they find evidence of the passage of another group previously sent before them.

Langiva takes Osmund to the body of Averill, claiming to have found her injured in the woods. That night, while the town has a feast to welcome their guests, Langiva leads Osmund into the forest where many women are performing a ritual during which Langiva appears to raise Averill from the dead. Osmund finds the crucified corpses of previous men sent by the church, and the entire group is taken prisoner and tied in a pit of water. Revealing that they knows of the group's true intentions, the Langiva and the villages invite the group to renounce God, leading to one being killed; another accepts, but is killed in secret anyway. Langiva tells Osmund that if he renounces God, he will be reunited with a resurrected Averill; however, Osmund realizes that despite looking alive, she cannot speak or even recognize him, and as the result kills her to free her soul from her undead state. As he is beaten up by the villagers, Osmund manage to drop a knife next to the remaining prisoners. Before being executed, Ulric reveals that he is infected with the plague, as that as such, he has been infecting the water pit ever since the group got trapped in it, therefore infecting the previously plague-free village; his gruesome execution only makes the infection more certain.

After the surviving mercenaries free themselves and fight the villager, Langiva claims to Osmund that she was never a witch, but simply a herbalist who is skilled with plants and drugs, and that Averill had never been dead at all; instead, she had simply been drugged, meaning that Osmund actually killed her. She then disappears into the mist and escapes. Osmund and the last surviving mercenary finally leave the village, bringing Langiva's second-in-command back to the Church. In the following years, the village becomes touched by the plague, while Osmund looses his heart, growing cold and cruel, dedicating himself to find Langiva; he punishes countless women in the name of God, believing them to be Langiva, and having seemingly lost his mind.

Ultimately it could not get off the ground in the UK and became a 100% German production.The film was financed solely out of [[Germany]], with Jens Meurer of Egoli Tossell Films acting as producer.<ref name="hr"/>

The film was originally due to be directed by [[Geoffrey Sax]]. [[Rupert Friend]] and [[Lena Headey]] were attached to star. [[Famke Janssen]] was later considered for Headey's role.<ref name = hr /><ref>{{cite web |title=Chris Smith Takes Over Black Death |first=Ryan |last=Rotten |date=2008-11-28 |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8652 |publisher=Shock Till You Drop |accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> After he was attached to direct ''Black Death'', Smith suggested Carice van Houten, Tim McInnerny, and John Lynch for their respective roles.<ref name = Smithinterview />

The film was shot in the German [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] at [[Blankenburg Castle (Harz)|Blankenburg Castle]] in the city of [[Blankenburg (Harz)|Blankenburg]] and [[:de:Burg Querfurt|Castle Querfurt]] in [[Querfurt]] and [[Zehdenick]], [[Brandenburg]] in the first half of 2009.<ref>{{cite news | title = Chris Smith Takes Over Black Death | first = Jo | last = Sharpe | url = http://www.themightybean.com/blackdeath.htm | work = The Mighty Bean | date = 2010-03-19 | accessdate = 2010-03-19 }}</ref> Van Houten's first day on set was 14 May 2009.<ref name = screen>{{cite news | title = HanWay Films sells "Black Death" to 12 Distributors | first = Martin | last = Blaney | url = http://www.screendaily.com/hanway-films-sells-black-death-to-12-distributors/5001088.article | work = [[Screen International]] | date = 2009-05-15 | accessdate = 2010-04-03 }}</ref> Technical elements included [[Production designer|production design]] by John Frankish, a spartan score by composer Christian Henson, and [[cinematography]] by Sebastian Edschmid.<ref name = variety /><ref>http://horrormoviesreviews.wordpress.com/</ref>

===Smith's approach to the film and script changes===
Smith explained his approach to the film:

{{quote|It's a 'medieval guys on a mission' movie. The period of the black death – what's fantastical and rich about that period? I said, 'What if we took a realistic approach?' The people of the time believe the plague was sent by God to punish them for their sins, or by the Devil to torment them. I wanted to find out what the characters felt and posit them on a journey of 'is it real? Or is it not real?' What would a necromancer be like if he existed? We added this fundamentalist knight, so it touches on fundamentalism. It's a super dark film but it's exciting. It's like a dark parable about how things haven't really moved on in the last 600 years.<ref>{{cite news | title = Director Chris Smith on Black Death | first = Ryan | last = Rotten | url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=13895 | work = Shock Till You Drop | date = 2010-01-29 | accessdate = 2010-04-03 }}</ref>}}

In the original script, the second half of the film turned to be entirely supernatural: Langiva was revealed to be the reincarnation of the Devil, while Osmund "was actually in Hell and Hell being in the physical place". Smith changed these elements to represent the idea that to him "Hell is the Hell you are in within yourself", as he tried to represent in ''[[Triangle (2009 British film)|Triangle]]''. Because it was considered too dark, producers tried to cut Smith's ending from the shooting schedule. However they changed their minds two days before the shootings of the epilogue.<ref name = Smithinterview />

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2016}}
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] provides links to 59 reviews of the film, 68% of which are positive. The critical consensus states: "''Black Death'' delivers the fire and brimstone violence its subject matter warrants, while posing some interesting questions of faith and religion."<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_death-2010/</ref> In an advance review, Leslie Felperin of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote "A savvy, stylish horror-actioner that's more than the sum of its genre parts, ''Black Death'' manages to deliver enough suspense and bloodletting to appease gore fans... Use of grainy stock and a preference for special effects rather than visual or CGI effects gives it a pleasingly retro feel, as does its willingness to explore uncomfortable moral ambiguities. Tech credits create a strong, fetid atmosphere on what looks like a low budget. German locations in Saxony look appropriately beautiful, sinister and ancient all at the same time."<ref name = variety>{{cite news | title = Berlin &ndash; ''Black Death'' Review | first = Leslie | last = Felperin | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942272.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2010-02-22 | accessdate = 2010-04-03 }}</ref>

Alan Jones from [[Film4]]'s FrightFest concluded: "Some may find the climax rather disconcerting as Smith pulls the rug from under one’s feet. However, the greater percentage will thrill to the way the eerie and puzzling intensity builds up a compelling head of scream as the stark brand of ''Witchfinder General'' shock value rears its head in the most startling of codas. This intelligent original represents a commendable break from the genre norm and is one of the most powerful films made about God, the godless and what the Devil truly represents."<ref>{{cite news |title=Film4 FrightFest &ndash; ''Black Death'' Review |first=Alan |last=Jones |url=http://www.frightfest.co.uk/blackdeathreview.html |work=[[Film4]] |accessdate=2010-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327163231/http://www.frightfest.co.uk/blackdeathreview.html |archivedate=27 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref>
