== Synopsis ==
Dan (Adam Somes) was an average student at Miskatonic University until he shot his friend Edward (James Payne), who was a patient at Arkham Asylum. Dan had been tried and sentenced to life at Arkham Penitentiary, but was later found dead in his cell, with only a manuscript to explain his deeds.

In it he details that Edward had begun seeing a new girlfriend, Asenath (Melissa Georgiou), whom he claimed could take over his body while he slept, part of powers that she gained from taking part in a cult. Things grow worse when Edward is implicated in a series of murders and imprisoned. Dan is brought in to the investigation by Inspector LeGrasse (Paul Douglas) and the two discover that Edward was involved with a cult that worshiped Cthulhu and were intent to use the being's power to their own ends. They enlist the help of one of the university professors, Armitage (Marcel Miller), to try to stop this from happening, only for this to result in the deaths of both Armitage and LeGrasse. Dan is then horrified to discover that his friend is possessed by Yog Sogof, which led him to murder Edward.

== Production ==
The film was primarily shot in [[Canberra]] over a two-week period during the winter of 1996 and additional scenes were shot during early 1997. Post-production on the film was completed in 1998. A large number of the interior locations were shot in the (now demolished) [[Royal Canberra Hospital]] which was de-commissioned in 1991 and remained vacant for many years before the building was imploded in July 1997. ''Cthulhu'' was produced on a very low budget and was shot on 16mm film and was later transferred to digital [[Betacam]] for finishing. A rough cut, dual head print was screened for [[Miramax]] in the [[Australian Film, Television and Radio School]]'s theatre in the hopes of obtaining finishing funds but was not ultimately purchased. The Producers abandoned hope of a theatrical release and raised additional funds to finish on video for a [[DVD]] release.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}}

==Critical reaction==

In their book ''Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft'', Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: "Even though the seams show, the plot creaks, and the acting clips in and out of reality, the makers of ''Cthulhu'' really do mean it, and sometimes meaning it is enough. In the end it's an earnest effort at weaving together different Lovecraftian motifs into a cohesive movie."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Migliore |first1=Andrew |last2=Strysik |first2=John |title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H.
