Freeing himself, he hops on a passing freight train and encounters a mysterious hobo (Lloyd W.L. Barnes, Jr.) who shares the secret of Mae’s activities.  Jake goes into seclusion for years, then returns to seek his revenge on Mae.<ref name="TV Guide Online review">[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/texas-night-train/135436 TV Guide Online review]</ref>

==Production and reception==
''Texas Night Train'' was produced on a US$7,200 budget.  According to the filmmaker, it was inspired by the [[rockabilly]] song "Moppin’ the Floor with My Baby’s Head."<ref name="TV Guide Online review"/>

The film had its theatrical premiere in [[New York City]] on September 21, 2001, and reviews were overwhelmingly negative. Rob Nelson, writing in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', called it "repugnant" and "a slow train to nowhere."<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0137,nelson,28024,20.html Village Voice review]</ref> Lawrence Van Gelder, reviewing the film for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said the production "amounts to about 10 minutes of storytelling in 75 minutes of repetitive film, ill-defined characters, wretched acting and droning voice-over maunderings."<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E2DC113BF932A1575AC0A9679C8B63 New York Times review]</ref> Rob Firsching’s review at the Amazing World of Cult Movies web site stated: "Every copy should be destroyed and Shanti Guy should be legally prohibited from ever picking up a camera again."<ref>[http://www.awcm.us/ccc/0027.htm Amazing World of Cult Movies review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930053845/http://www.awcm.us/ccc/0027.htm |date=2009-09-30 }}</ref>

Despite the negative critical reaction, filmmaker Shanti Guy told the media that audiences were more receptive. As he stated in an interview: “There are three standard reactions that I got. Number one: we are proud of you whatever you do. Number two: that was some much cooler than I thought it would be. And number three: so, what was it about? I plan to try the film in some festivals and see if it gets picked up there. If nothing happens with that, I will distribute it myself in the hopes that it will become an underground rockabilly cult film.”<ref>[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&Id=141 Film Threat interview with Shanti Guy]</ref>
