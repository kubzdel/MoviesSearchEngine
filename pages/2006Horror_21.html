'''''Black Christmas''''' (abbreviated as '''''Black X-Mas''''') is a 2006 [[slasher film]] written and directed by [[Glen Morgan]] and starring [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Michelle Trachtenberg]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Oliver Hudson]], [[Lacey Chabert]], [[Kristen Cloke]], and [[Andrea Martin]]. The film takes place several days before Christmas and tells the story of a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by the house's former inhabitants during a winter storm. It is a loose [[remake]] of the 1974 [[Black Christmas (1974 film)|film of the same name]]. A co-production of Canada and the United States, the film was produced by Morgan and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] through their production company Hard Eight Pictures, along with [[2929 Productions]], Adelstein-Parouse Productions and Hoban Segal Productions.

Director Glen Morgan signed on to write and direct the film after the release of his 2003 remake of ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]''. Shooting took place  in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, in 2005. The film was co-distributed by [[Dimension Films]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. According to Morgan, he and Wong had numerous disputes with Dimension executives [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] regarding the tone of the script as well as the film's conclusion, which resulted in numerous re-writes and re-shoots.

In December 2006, upon anticipation of its release, the film garnered criticism from [[Religious denomination|religious groups]] due to its depiction of graphic content in a holiday setting, as well as the distributor's decision to release the film on [[Christmas Day]] in the United States. The film opened in the United Kingdom on December 15, 2006, and, premiered at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California on December 19. Despite backlash from some religious organizations, ''Black Christmas'' was released in the United States on December 25, 2006. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and went on to gross $21 million worldwide against a $9 million budget.

==Plot==
[[Billy (Black Christmas)|William Edward "Billy" Lenz]], a boy born with severe [[jaundice]], is constantly abused by his hateful mother, Constance Lenz.  With the help of her lover, Constance murders Billy's father, Frank, on [[Christmas Eve]] 1975 and buries his body in the house's crawlspace.  To prevent Billy from talking, she imprisons him in the attic.  Years later, Constance attempts to conceive another child, but realizes that her boyfriend is [[impotence|impotent]].  She goes to the attic and rapes twelve-year-old Billy. Nine months later, Constance gives birth to their daughter, Agnes.

Constance uses the occasion of Agnes' birth to further reject Billy, and her boyfriend believes he fathered Agnes.  On [[Christmas Day]] 1991, Billy escapes from the attic and disfigures eight-year-old Agnes by gouging out her eye.  He then brutally murders his mother and her lover.  He is caught by police eating cookies made out of his mother's flesh, and is sent to a mental asylum.

Fifteen years later, on Christmas Eve, Billy, now 35, escapes from his cell and heads to his former home, now a sorority house for Delta Alpha Kappa at [[Lists of fictional locations|Clemson University]] outside [[Boston]].  At the house, Clair Crosby, one of the sorority girls, is murdered in her bedroom by an unknown figure.  Meanwhile, Megan Helms begins to hear noises and goes up to the attic to investigate. Upon finding Clair's body in a rocking chair, Megan is attacked and killed by the same assailant.  In the living room, the other sorority sisters, Kelli Presley, Melissa Kitt, Heather Fitzgerald, Dana Mathis and Lauren Hannon, along with their housemother Mrs. Mac, receive a threatening call from a stranger.

Clair's half-sister Leigh Colvin soon arrives, searching for her.  The withdrawn Eve Agnew presents Heather with a glass unicorn before leaving the sorority house to go home for the holidays. Meanwhile, Kelli's boyfriend, Kyle Autry, arrives but is kicked out when Kelli discovers a video of he and Megan having sex.  When the lights suddenly go out, Dana goes to check the power under the house, but encounters the figure in the crawlspace and is dragged underneath and killed with a [[garden fork]].  The girls in the house subsequently receive an indecipherable call from Dana's cell phone. Outside while searching for Dana, they find Eve's severed head in her car.

With the police are unable to arrive in time due to a snow storm, Kelli, Melissa and Leigh decide to stay inside the house whilst Heather and Mrs. Mac flee.  In the car, Heather is murdered, and Mrs. Mac is impaled by a falling icicle.  While Kelli and Leigh descend to the garage to investigate, Melissa is attacked and killed by an assailant with a pair of ice skates.  Kelli and Leigh return upstairs and find Lauren's eyeless corpse in bed.  Kyle returns to the house, and the three go to investigate the attic; while ascending the ladder, Kyle is dragged into the attic and stabbed to death.  The killer is revealed to be Agnes, now an adult; Kelli and Leigh watch in horror as Billy appears in the attic as well.  Agnes, along with Billy, attacks Kelli, knocking three of them into the empty space between the walls of the house.

Kelli and Leigh manage to escape before starting a fire, and leave Billy and Agnes to burn to death.  Later, Kelli and Leigh recover at the hospital.  Billy, who is partially burned, kills the morgue assistant. While Kelli goes for an x-ray, Agnes (also survived from being burned to death) appears in her hospital room and kills Leigh.  When Kelli returns to her room, Agnes appears through the ceiling and attacks her, but Kelli uses a defibrillator to kill Agnes. Moments later, Billy enters through the ceiling and chases Kelli to the stairwell.  They briefly fight, ending with Kelli pushing Billy off the railing where he is subsequently impaled on the tip of a Christmas tree, killing him.

{{quote box|width=20%|align=right|bgcolor=cornsilk|quote=I think a slasher movie is really a modern monster movie. The difference between the [[Val Lewton]] movies [and] ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' is just exploitation.|source=Morgan on his concepts of slasher films, 2006<ref name=may>{{cite av media|title=May All Your Christmases Be Black|year=2006|publisher=Genius Productions, Inc.|format=DVD|work=Black Christmas|people=Morgan, Glen (director), et al.}}</ref>}}
After his debut feature, ''[[Willard (2003 film)|Willard]]'' (2003)—a remake of an earlier [[Willard (1971 film)|1971 film]]—failed to perform well at the box office, Morgan was approached by Dimension Films to write and direct a remake of ''Black Christmas'' (1974).<ref name=may/> Morgan was a fan of the original film, and cited it as a predecessor to the modern slasher film, which influenced his decision to commit to the remake.<ref name=whathave>{{cite av media|title=What Have You Done? The Remaking of 'Black Christmas'|year=2006|publisher=Genius Productions, Inc.|format=DVD|work=Black Christmas|people=Morgan, Glen (director), et al.}}</ref> Star Crystal Lowe noted Morgan's admiration and aim to "take the film to a different level," while "respecting the fact that [the original] was a great movie to begin with."<ref name=whathave/> 
[[File:Kempermugshot.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Morgan was inspired by the crimes of serial killer [[Edmund Kemper]] when writing the film.]]
In conceiving a new script, Morgan had intended to rework elements of the original film that were left ambiguous or implied, such as the cryptic phone calls received by the sorority house.<ref name=whathave/> While writing the screenplay, Morgan received input from the film's original director, [[Bob Clark]], who also signed on to co-produce the remake.<ref name=whathave/> Clark gave Morgan his "blessing," stating in an interview that the remake was "still ''Black Christmas''," but explored new subplots that had not been fleshed out in the 1974 film.<ref name=whathave/>

Morgan created an extensive subplot for the film's killer, Billy, which introduced a secondary killer in Billy's younger sister, Agnes (in the original film, the names Billy and Agnes figure prominently in the obscene calls received by the sorority sisters).<ref name=whathave/>{{sfn|Hantke|2010|p=112}} In writing the character of Billy, Morgan was inspired by the life of [[Edmund Kemper]], a real-life serial killer who as a child had been locked in the basement of his home by his mother, whom he later murdered.<ref name=whathave/> The introduction of Agnes as a second killer was, according to Mary Elizabeth Winstead, incorporated in-part to extend the film's narrative arc, given that the "[[The babysitter and the man upstairs|phone calls coming from inside the house]]" plot twist from the 1974 film was too familiar for contemporary audiences.<ref name=whathave/> The relationship between Billy and Agnes also allowed Morgan room to explore themes of family, which are also prevalent in the relationships between the female characters.<ref name=whathave/> In a 2014 interview with Morgan, he claimed that his inclusion of a second killer was under the urging of Dimension Films executives: "I felt that a ten million dollar movie of ''Black Christmas'' didn’t need anyone’s help, and they should have left us alone. But they had to have the two killers, and then they were after kids from ''[[The O.C.]]'' We compromised a lot."{{sfn|Vander Kaay|Fernandez-Vander Kaay|2014|p=169}}

===Casting===
In casting the sorority sister characters, Morgan sought actresses who were "of the same calibre," in order to avoid [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] of the [[final girl]] and the supporting characters.<ref name=whathave/> Katie Cassidy, who also had recently had a supporting part in the ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' remake, was cast in the lead role of Kelli Presley.<ref name=whathave/> Michelle Trachtenberg, who had gained notoriety for her role as [[Dawn Summers]] on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', had initially wanted to avoid returning to the horror genre unless she were "given the opportunity to die" onscreen.<ref name=may/> Trachtenberg read the script for the film in the middle of the night while alone in her home, and was unnerved by it, which influenced her decision to sign onto the project; she was cast in the supporting role of Melissa Kitt.<ref name=may/> Canadian actress Crystal Lowe was cast as Lauren Hannon, a feisty sorority sister from a dysfunctional family,<ref name=whathave/> while Lacey Chabert was cast in the role of Dana Mathis, a conceited woman from a privileged background.<ref name=whathave/>

Oliver Hudson was cast as Kyle Autry, the male lead and [[red herring]]<ref name=whathave/> after finding the script effective, as well being impressed by Morgan's remake of ''Willard'': "The style of [that film] complemented the script, and I thought if Glen could marry the two, it would be cool, and a little different."<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207115517/http://www.ign.com/videos/2006/12/20/black-christmas-movie-interview-katie-cassidy-oliver-hudson|url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2006/12/20/black-christmas-movie-interview-katie-cassidy-oliver-hudson|date=December 20, 2006|accessdate=October 2, 2017|archivedate=February 7, 2017|title=Katie Cassidy & Oliver Hudson|work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> [[Andrea Martin]], who had played the role of Phyllis in the 1974 film, was cast as the sorority housemother, Ms. Mac.<ref name=whathave/>

===Filming===
''Black Christmas'' was shot on location in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.<ref name=whathave/> Given that a great deal of the film takes place during a blackout inside a home, the cinematographers and lighting department were forced to find inventive ways to achieve appropriate lighting on the actors, which included cutting holes in the walls.<ref name=whathave/> The film's prominent exhibition of Christmas decorations and its overtly red [[Color scheme|color palette]] were deliberately chosen by Morgan, who wanted to evoke an "American Christmas," which he characterized as being a cross between "[[Washington Irving]] and [[Coca-Cola]]."<ref name=whathave/>

On her first day of shooting during a fight scene with the killer, Lacey Chabert injured her leg and had to fly to Los Angeles to see a doctor; however, she was able to return to the set the following day and continue filming.<ref name=whathave/>

===Studio intervention===
[[File: Harvey Weinstein 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Harvey Weinstein]] had additional footage shot for television spots.]]
According to Morgan, he and James Wong had various disputes with Dimension Films executives [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]], specifically about the film's tone and the way it should end.{{sfn|Vander Kaay|Fernandez-Vander Kaay|2014|pages=168–9}} Morgan's original script ended with Kelli and Leigh in the hospital receiving a phone call from Billy, whom they believed to be dead; this scene, which Morgan filmed, was intended to pay [[homage (arts)|homage]] to the conclusion of the original film.{{sfn|Vander Kaay|Fernandez-Vander Kaay|2014|p=168}} This ending, however, was scrapped by Bob Weinstein, who requested Morgan write and shoot a different ending. This ultimately resulted in the more violent conclusion that appears in the theatrical cut, which has Billy being impaled on the hospital's Christmas tree topper.{{sfn|Vander Kaay|Fernandez-Vander Kaay|2014|pages=168–9}}

As a result of various cuts made during post-production, there are at least two different cuts of ''Black Christmas'' that exist: One which was released in Europe, and the cut released in North America, which feature slight variations.<ref name=censor>{{cite web|work=Movie-Censorship|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4710|title=Black Christmas|accessdate=March 1, 2018}}</ref> The European cut, which is four minutes shorter than the North American cut,<ref name=bbfc/> features an alternate death scene and ending.<ref>{{cite av media|work=Black Christmas|series=Deleted Scenes|title=Melissa's Death (International version)|year=2007|publisher=Genius Productions, Inc.|format=DVD|isbn=1-594-44545-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite av media|title=Black Christmas|people=Morgan, Glen (director)|year=2007|publisher=Genius Productions, Inc.|format=DVD|isbn=1-594-44545-1}}</ref>

The film holds a 14% approval rating on the internet [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], labeled "rotten" based on 58 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: "A gratuitous remake of the 1974 slasher, ''Black Christmas'' pumps out the gore and blood with zero creativity, humor, or visual flair."<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Christmas|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_christmas/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate= March 3, 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film was given an average rating of 22/100 based on 17 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Christmas Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-christmas|work=Metacritic|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> The film has been characterized by film scholars and critics as an example of a contemporary [[slasher film]].{{sfn|Hantke|2010|p=48}}

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the film: "With a peephole-riddled set and a flashback-heavy screenplay, ''Black Christmas'' smothers terror beneath a blanket of unnecessary information, revealing too much and teasing too little. And despite some nifty camerawork — a shot of an asylum inmate gobbling Christmas dinner cuts seamlessly to a couple snogging in a car — the movie is a dismal Christmas card to its predecessor."<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|author=Catsoulis, Jeannette|date=December 27, 2006|accessdate=October 2, 2017|title=Psycho Killer Holiday Tip: Use Eyeballs as Ornaments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/movies/27blac.html}}</ref> Sam Adams of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "Like an ugly tie or a pair of slipper socks, ''Black Christmas'' is destined to be forgotten the instant it's unwrapped, gathering dust until the season rolls around again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/26/entertainment/et-black26 |title=Slay bells ring, but don't listen |date= December 26, 2006|author=Adams, Sam|accessdate=October 2, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', however, said, "This film is an evocative, effective entry into the holiday blood-spray subgenre in its own right. And if it doesn't make your skin crawl ... you probably ate too much Christmas dinner."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A430304 |title=Black Christmas

In the United Kingdom, Jamie Russell of [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] also praised the film, writing: "It's no ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'', but it lives up to its title, a black (comedy) Christmas movie, with halls decked with holly, mistletoe and a Christmas tree full of popped eyeballs. Unlike the recent ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' remake (which also starred Cassidy), ''Black Christmas'' has the smarts to be playful, with a choice selection of festive slasher gags pushing the envelope of bad taste: a candy cane's sucked into a stabbing weapon and angel-shaped cookie cutters do more than cut cookies. The result's an undemanding multiplex filler–a ho-ho-horror movie that knows it's the season to be jolly."<ref name=bbc/>

Horror review website [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that the film should not be compared to the original.  The site concluded that the film is "a pretty good modern slasher."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109302/black-christmas-remake-2/ |title = Black Christmas (remake)|work=Bloody-Disgusting | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607071816/http://bloody-disgusting.com:80/reviews/109302/black-christmas-remake-2/|archivedate=June 7, 2012|deadurl=yes|date=December 25, 2016 |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> The ''[[Radio Times]]'' also gave the film a favorable review, giving the film three stars out of five and calling the film a "cheeky but no less brutal remake."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/nbvfm/black-christmas|title=Black Christmas film review |work=Radio Times |date= December 15, 2006|accessdate=December 23, 2016|author=Russell, Jamie}}</ref> For her performance, Mary Elizabeth Winstead was nominated for a [[2007 Scream Awards#Scream Queen|Scream Queen]] award at the [[2007 Scream Awards]].<ref name=sfg>{{cite web|work=SF Gate|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Winstead-leaves-slashers-for-Smashed-3941048.php|title=Winstead leaves slashers for 'Smashed'|author=Stein, Ruthe|date=October 14, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2017|archivedate= October 3, 2017| archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171003083350/http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Winstead-leaves-slashers-for-Smashed-3941048.php}}</ref>

In a retrospective by ''[[Fangoria]]'', Ken Hanley said the film "benefits from solid and focused direction" and "wears its cringeworthy elements as a badge of honor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/santa-showdown-black-christmas-2006-vs-silent-night-2012/|work=Fangoria|author=Hanley, Ken W.|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2016|title=Santa Showdown: “BLACK CHRISTMAS (2006) vs. “SILENT NIGHT” (2012)}}</ref> Film scholar Jessica Robinson also praised the film's depiction of its female characters, writing: "The sorority sisters in ''Black Christmas'' are set up to be ideal females. They all have long hair, they are concerned with how they look, and they sit on the couch and file their nails. However, unlike stereotypical females, they also drink, cuss, and talk badly about their families."{{sfn|Robinson|2012|p=149}}
