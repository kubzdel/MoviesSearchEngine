{{nihongo|'''''Meatball Machine'''''|ミートボールマシン|Mītobōru mashin}} is a 2005 Japanese science fiction splatter film directed by [[Yūdai Yamaguchi]] and Jun'ichi Yamamoto based on a film by Yamamoto from 1999. Special effects and makeup effects were by [[Yoshihiro Nishimura]].

==Plot==
Yōji is a young lonely factory worker who falls for an equally lonely girl co-worker, Sachiko, but is unable to tell her of his interest.  After he is assaulted in a theater by a crossdresser, Yōji finds what looks like an alien insect and hides it in his room. The next night, he comes across Sachiko being sexually attacked by another fellow worker. He attempts to come to her aid but is beaten. Sachiko feels sorry for him and returns with him to his apartment. During this encounter, Sachiko is attacked by the alien object which penetrates her and turns her into a bio-mechanical monster, a NecroBorg. These parasites take over human bodies and use their flesh to create weapons which they use to fight each other. Yōji is also infected and the plot eventually leads to a showdown fight to the death between the two would-be lovers. A side plot concerns a father who is out to kill the NecroBorgs who have also infected his daughter.

==Production==
''Meatball Machine'' is based on a 1999 film of the same name written, produced and directed by Jun'ichi Yamamoto. The 70 minute theatrical version was released in Japan on May 22, 1999 and starred Toshihisa Watanabe, Akiko Sasaki and Rino Sōma.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0878820/|title=Meatball Machine (1999)|publisher=[http://us.imdb.com/ IMdB]|accessdate=2009-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_c.php?num_c=241691|script-title=ja:ミートボールマシン|publisher=[http://www.allcinema.net/ All Cinema]|accessdate=2009-07-29|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==Reception==
Some reviews called the film a mediocre rip-off of [[Shinya Tsukamoto]]'s classic ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]'' but the Severed Cinema reviewer calls ''Meatball Machine'' the superior of the two movies, "a super-gory hodgepodge tongue-in-cheek ultraviolent video game monster mash misfit movie with ... charm and silly sweetness".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://severed-cinema.com/index.php?Itemid=26&id=69&option=com_content&task=view|title=Meatball Machine|publisher=[http://severed-cinema.com/ Severed Cinema]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref>

Another reviewer, however, labels it "a resume reel" and "a difficult movie to defend"<ref name="dvdverdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/meatballmachine.php|title=Meatball Machine|publisher=[http://www.dvdverdict.com/ DVD Verdict]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> although the Dreamin' Demon review says it is "one of the more entertaining B-Movies I have watched in a while."<ref name="demon">{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamindemon.com/2009/07/18/review-meatball-machine/|title=Meatball Machine Review|publisher=[http://www.dreamindemon.com/ The Dreamin' Demon]|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> A further review praises the special effects and makeup effects but not the movie.<ref name="chud"/>

Two of the reviewers mention that the film's plot of doomed lovers who cannot connect can be taken as a metaphor for the difficulties and dangers inherent in expressing feelings and how emotional issues can be transformed into something monstrous.<ref name="dvdverdict"/><ref name="demon"/>
