The shoot was planned to last 19 days.  Impressed with ''[[The Signal (2007 film)|The Signal]]'' and its fast shooting schedule, Bartlett sought out that film's director of photography, but unforeseen circumstances, including an influenza outbreak, caused shooting to extend to 30 days.  Bartlett and original scriptwriter Child were heavily involved in casting.<ref name=wamg/>
