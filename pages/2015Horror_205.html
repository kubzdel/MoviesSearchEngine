==Reception==
Staci Layne Wilson, writing for [[Dread Central]], praised the acting and the effects, but said that "the lackluster plot and shaky-cam cinematography are bound to have more viewers diving for the fast-forward button early on, skipping to the end and not missing a thing in-between".<ref name="Dread">{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/87602/zombie-killers-elephants-graveyard-blu-ray-dvd/ |title=Zombie Killers: Elephant’s Graveyard (Blu-ray / DVD) |last=Layne Wilson |first=Stacy |date=February 2, 2015 |website=Dread Central |access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>

Martin Liebman, of Blu-ray.com, wrote, " Zombie Killers: Elephant's Graveyard is a film that tries too hard and ends up lacking the tighter cohesion necessary to tell a better, richer story".<ref name="Blu">{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Zombie-Killers-Elephants-Graveyard-Blu-ray/121349/#Review |title=

It also tries too hard to be something more than it actually is".<ref name="High"/>
