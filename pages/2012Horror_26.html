==Plot synopsis==
Atom (Mark Shonsey) is an avid [[Bowler (ten-pin)|bowler]] and hardcore horror movie fan. After having his team barred from the championship due to bowling alley corruption and losing his horny girlfriend Emily (Lindy Starr) to sadistic rival bowler Dario (Zachary Byron Helm), Atom suffers a severe head injury, causing him to [[Hallucination|hallucinate]] that everyone around him are the flesh-eating [[Zombie (fictional)|undead]]. Believing the [[zombie apocalypse]] has arrived, Atom must defend himself from the "zombies" in the most violent and unpredictable manner possible.

''Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer'' has been described as a "love letter to [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]]", featuring much of the [[Camp (style)|campy]] aesthetic and graphic violence and nudity common of the company's films, as well as including many overt references to Troma movies and a cameo appearance from Troma president [[Lloyd Kaufman]].<ref name="SLCWeekly">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/blog-70-8637-atom-the-amazing-zombie-killer.html |title=Atom The Amazing Zombie Killer |author=Sheehan, Gavin |publisher=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]] |date=November 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name="ATAZKWestword">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.westword.com/showandtell/2012/08/atom_the_amazing_zombie_killer.php |publisher=[[Westword]] |title=Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer co-director Richard Taylor on bringing a Troma-esque sensibility to Denver film |date=August 30, 2012 |author=Casciato, Cory}}</ref>

==Production==
''Atom'' is the first feature-length film from [[Denver, Colorado]]-based [[production company]] Bizjack Flemco and filmmakers Zack Beins and Richard Taylor, who had previously directed the 2007 short film ''[[The Misled Romance of Cannibal Girl & Incest Boy]]'' and had provided special effects work for several independent films, most notably [[Troma Entertainment]]{{'}}s ''[[Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead]]''.<ref name="SLCWeekly" /><ref name="ATAZKWestword" /><ref name="FlunkRock">{{cite web |url=http://flunkrock.com/atom-the-amazing-zombie-killer/ |title=Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer |date=June 14, 2012 |author=Retrofit, Roy |publisher=Flunk Rock}}</ref> To help finance the film, Beins and Taylor shot a fake [[trailer (film)|trailer]] to generate interest, and hosted several [[benefit concert]]s for the movie with local bands.<ref name="FlunkRock" />

The film was shot entirely in the cities of Denver and [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]], [[Colorado]] over the course of four years.<ref name="CouchCutter">{{cite web|url=http://couchcutter.com/my-hairlines-not-the-same-a-chat-with-the-makers-of-atom-the-amazing-zombie-killer/ |title="My Hairlineâ€™s Not the Same" A Chat With the makers of "Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer" |publisher=Couch Cutters |author=Ambrose, Chace |date=June 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416075741/http://couchcutter.com/my-hairlines-not-the-same-a-chat-with-the-makers-of-atom-the-amazing-zombie-killer/ |archivedate=2013-04-16 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560765/locations |title=Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer (2012) - Filming Locations |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> According to interviews with Taylor and Beins, the production was troubled by numerous issues, exacerbated by the extremely low budget of the film; notably, large portions of the film had to be re-shot after one of the main actors quit and had to be recast, while problems in finding affordable filming locations resulted in shooting at five different bowling alleys.<ref name="SLCWeekly" /><ref name="ATAZKWestword" /><ref name="FlunkRock" /> ''Atom'' was shot in [[high-definition video]]; as neither Beins or Taylor owned an HD camera, the two tracked down a friend who did and offered him an acting role in exchange for use of their camera.<ref name="FlunkRock" />

In addition to Troma president [[Lloyd Kaufman]], the cast of ''Atom'' also includes cameo appearances from Denver performance artist [[Maris the Great]], [[KBPI]] DJs Uncle Nasty and Matt Need, [[paranormal]] claims investigators [[Bryan & Baxter]], [[Internet celebrity|internet personality]] Shawn C. Phillips and popular [[drag queen]] horror actor Babette Bombshell (''[[Not Another B Movie]]'', ''[[Class of Nuke 'Em High#Sequels|Return to the Class of Nuke 'Em High]]'').<ref name="ATAZKWestword" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560765/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast |title=Atom the Amazing Zombie Killer (2012) - Full Cast and Crew |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}</ref> Zachory Byon Helm, who was cast as the film's primary antagonist Dario, is the president of the Denver Hearse Association, and several of his hearses were used in the production.
