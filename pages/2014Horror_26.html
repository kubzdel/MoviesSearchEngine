==Production and release==
Film was directed and written by Dilip Sood. In an interview he said, "Since childhood I have been a huge horror fan with a special interest in slasher and psychological horror films. Through ''Bhaangarh'', I have tried to deviate from the traditional Indian horror film and give audiences a new experience which draws from both these subgenres. The film will surely take audience by surprise, keeping them guessing and scaring them at the same time. The movie deals with human emotion and how, when your worst nightmare comes true, it becomes impossible to tell between a friend from a foe. We have tried to capture this essence and communicate it to audience through the movie's trailer and poster."<ref>{{cite web|title=Trailer Review: Bhaangarh – This One Will Spook You Out|url=http://businessofcinema.com/trailers-video-2/trailer-review-bhaangarh-one-will-spook/151139|website=Business of Cinema|accessdate=17 November 2015|date=8 June 2014}}</ref>
