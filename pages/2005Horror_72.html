==Production==
This is the first Khmer monster film and also the first graphic film. It was produced and distributed by Campro Production, one of the best Khmer production companies.

The film's plot is about the journey to Ratanakiri, but the footage was shot in part of [[Mondulkiri]] Province as there also were the appearance of indigenous peoples in this film.

In this film, the giant snake is actually a python, but they used special effects to make it look giant-sized. Several scenes of the film use professional computer, graphic, and sound effects techniques to make everything seem unbelievable.<ref name="khmer.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www.khmer.org/product/0,prod,0,0,0,2650,0.htm|title=The Forest: |accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=Khmer.org}}</ref> This production is seen as the first strong special effects film for [[Cambodia]].

==Release==
The film was released in only one cinema in Cambodia competing against another famous Khmer film, ''[[The Snake King's Grandchild]]'', the sequel of ''[[Snaker]]'' which was released in four cinemas on the same date. But ''The Forest'' still grossed well in the Khmer box office as all the tickets were sold out in its opening weekend. It is considered to be one of the most successful films of early 2005 in Cambodia and was received well critically, especially on www.khmer.org which rated it 9.5 out of 10 for a job done well.<ref name="khmer.org"/>
