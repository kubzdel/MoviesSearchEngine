''Claustrophobia'' has only three main speaking roles. Kines first invited [[Melanie Lynskey]] to take part in the film, as the two had worked together previously on his debut feature ''Foreign Correspondents''. The search then began for the two remaining leads, with Kines receiving over 1,000 headshots during the auditioning process.<ref>[http://www.horror-asylum.com/interview/marktapiokines/interview.asp ''Horror Asylum'' interview with Mark Tapio Kines], June 14, 2004</ref> [[Sheeri Rappaport]] and [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] were cast soon thereafter.

After a brief rehearsal period, [[Melanie Lynskey]], [[Sheeri Rappaport]] and [[Mary Lynn Rajskub]] were set to star in the film.
