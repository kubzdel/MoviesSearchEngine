T2 refers to Tenement 2, one of the buildings in Brgy. Western Bicutan, [[Taguig City]] where some of the scenes were shot. In the movie, [[Maricel Soriano]] plays a ''Save an Orphan Foundation'' volunteer who brings an orphan home only to discover that the girl comes from a family of ''[[Engkanto]]s''.

==Plot==
The movie begins with Claire ([[Maricel Soriano]]) with Elias ([[Eric Fructuoso]]) picking up a child as an assignment. Her mission is to give her to her adoptive family. After picking up the child Angeli ([[Mika Dela Cruz]]); strange things start to occur. When they arrived at the Tenement 2, where Angeli's new parents are staying, they only find Tess ([[Camille Prats]]), Melissa ([[K Brosas]]) and Domeng (Mon Confiado). Angeli pleads Claire to not leave her no matter what happens, and writes a letter to her which is not to be read until it is supposed to be read.

As Elias came searching for the sleeping Angeli and Claire, he fell victim of entities and was eventually killed. After a while, Claire wakes just to find Angeli missing and starts to search for her only to find Elias dead. She then finds Angeli being possessed only to be awaken back to her consciousness through Claire's presence. For the second time, Angeli pleads Claire not to leave her and decides to escape the building. They failed to make it out as a huge swarm of rats, due to the entities, starts to attack them which forced them to separate. Fortunately, Claire was saved by a myseterious lady using her magic lamp. The lady then tells her to run quickly and be ready before midnight (which is three in the morning for the entities, which was revealed are Fairies).

Angeli was taken by the fairies while the lady explains to Claire the truth about Angeli and the fairies. She reveals that she too had a child with a fairy and the rule that a fairy raised in the human world will be forcibly taken from the human world once he/she turns nine years old. The lady advises that the child shouldn't be given to the fairies as in the fairy world it is believed that love nor emotion do not exist. Bravely, both decided to go back where she and Angeli once stayed and found Angeli's letters which was believed to be important. They luckily escaped monsters laid on their paths.  Suddenly, both mysteriously arrived in the fairy world and the lady finally finds her child that was taken from her only to be rejected believing she doesn't have any family in their dimension.

It was then when Isabel ([[Carmen Soo]]), one of the fairies, introduced herself as the mother of Angeli, and tells the real story of their life of Angeli and her father. During this time, Jeremy was seen searching for Claire in the building. Everyone awaits for Angeli's decision.  But before she decides, she is confronted by Claire who reads her the letters and memories of her human life with her human father who was discovered to be blinded after the death by her fairy wife after the discovery that she is a fairy. Angeli then breaks down remembering her human father.

The fairies then challenges Claire for Angeli or Jeremy's lives. Angered, Angeli then threatens her mother that if the fairies ever touch or hurt Claire's husband she will not be with them when she turns 18. Instead, she promises that she will join them once she turns 18. The lady then kills all the fairies using a potion and disappears with them. They then wake up in real life being found by Jeremy.

After the events, Angeli was then adopted by Claire and Jeremy and goes to her new school where she mysteriously too was chased by fairies then finding out that her teacher is her fairy mother.
