'''''Revision – Apocalypse II''''' is a 2009 drama/ horror film written and directed by Edwin Brienen. The film is an international co-production of Germany, Netherlands and the United States and celebrated its premiere at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]] in 2010.

==Plot==
A government-controlled society. Former nude model Traci ([[Eva Dorrepaal]]) has lost her grip on reality. She feels threatened by an invisible force, a ‘Big Brother’. Under influence of her photographer husband Charlie (Clayton Nemrow), she rejects God and surrenders herself to the ultimate act of evil: murder. Outside the streets are burning. The return of a false Messiah causes destruction and chaos. Haunted by her inner-demon (Jacob Dove Basker), Traci slowly sinks into madness.

==Soundtrack==
All music was written and performed by the House of Destructo, a project of Dutch producer Vincent Koreman. [[The Horrorist]] makes an appearance with the song ‘Sex Machine’.

==Critical response==
"Inappropriate? Monstrous? Or is it crossing borders? And simply brilliant? It actually all fits: 'Revision' is eccentric and over-the-top. Brienen belongs to a small group of directors: you can love him and hate him at the same time."
-Filmkrant, Netherlands

==DVD==
European Filmfreak Distribution released the film in 2010. A North-American DVD release is scheduled for 21 August 2012 through MVD Visual.
