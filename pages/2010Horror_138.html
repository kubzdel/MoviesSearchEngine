'''''Resident Evil: Afterlife''''' is a 2010 [[3-D film|3D]] [[horror film#Subgenres|action horror film]]<ref name="BoxOfficeMojo"/> written and directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]. It stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Ali Larter]], [[Kim Coates]], [[Shawn Roberts]], [[Spencer Locke]], [[Boris Kodjoe]], and [[Wentworth Miller]]. The film marks Anderson's second time to direct in the series, the first being the [[Resident Evil (film)|first installment]]. It is the first to be shot in 3D and fourth installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is based on the [[Capcom]] [[survival horror]] video game series [[Resident Evil|of the same name]].

The film follows [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] searching for and rescuing the remaining survivors in Los Angeles after the T-virus outbreak, and teaming up against [[Albert Wesker]], the head of the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. [[Chris Redfield]], a primary character from the video games, was featured for the first time in the film franchise. Other characters from the games and films who returned are: [[Claire Redfield]], Chris's sister who has lost her memory prior to the film's events; Albert Wesker, the film's main antagonist; and [[Jill Valentine]], who made a cameo appearance.

In May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel titled ''Afterlife''. ''Extinction'' was released in 2007 and was a box office success, prompting ''Afterlife'' to begin development in June 2008, with the script being written by Anderson that December. Elements from the video game ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' (2009) were incorporated into the film. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from September to December 2009 using the 3D [[Fusion Camera System]].

The film was released in 3D and [[IMAX#IMAX 3D|IMAX 3D]] theaters on September 10, 2010, to generally negative reviews. The film grossed $60 million in the United States and Canada on an estimated $60 million budget, and made $240 million in other markets surpassing the previous film's overseas total in the second week of release. Grossing a worldwide total of $300 million, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' became the second highest-grossing entry of the series. ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' was released to DVD, [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]] on December 28, 2010 in the United States.

==Plot==
One year after the events of [[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]], Alice ([[Milla Jovovich]]) and her clones lead the assault to attack Umbrella HQ, located in [[Tokyo]], slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker ([[Shawn Roberts]]), who escapes in a [[Tiltrotor|tiltrotor plane]] and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive [[sinkhole]]. The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to inject her with an anti-virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.

Six months later, Alice travels to [[Alaska]] in an [[Yak-52|airplane]], tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called ''Arcadia''; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral [[Claire Redfield]] ([[Ali Larter]]). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of [[Los Angeles]], where they find survivors living in [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility|a prison]] which is surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, ([[Boris Kodjoe]]) who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell ([[Fulvio Cecere]]), Crystal Waters ([[Kacey Clarke]]), Bennett ([[Kim Coates]]), Kim Yong ([[Norman Yeung]]), and Angel Ortiz ([[Sergio Peris-Mencheta]]). With their help, Alice finally lands on the prison's roof and learns ''Arcadia'' isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, [[Chris Redfield|Chris]] ([[Wentworth Miller]]), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route in exchange for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to [[Voyeurism|peep]]. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked by a group of infected people that dug into the prison. They take Wendell, but she manages to kill them.

Desperate, they free Chris, who reveals that Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, and it would take a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for ''Arcadia'' in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.

Alice and the Redfields board the ''Arcadia'', discovering it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers ''Arcadia'' is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart ([[Spencer Locke]]). Alice follows a trail of blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-Virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes [[Cannibalism|fresh human DNA]] can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level. Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over the effects of the T-Virus.

The Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett, now working for Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett in the room with Wesker's corpse. Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the ''Arcadia''; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, Wesker [[parachuting|parachutes]] away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn ''Arcadia'' into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. As Alice, Claire and Chris watch over from ''Arcadia'', it is approached by a military [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of Umbrella aircraft.

During a [[mid-credits scene]] in one of the aircraft, Jill Valentine ([[Sienna Guillory]]), who went missing after [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|the Raccoon City destruction incident]], is dictating the attack wearing the same mind control device used on Claire.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Wentworth Miller 2008.jpg|175px|thumb|When Miller first read the script he thought the association to ''[[Prison Break]]'' was a practical joke with his imprisonment and his first line being, "I know a way out of here."<ref name="Miller"/>]]

In May 2005, producers mentioned the possibility of following ''Extinction'' with a sequel entitled ''Afterlife'', to be shot and set in Tokyo, Japan and Alaska.<ref name="hr1" /> Despite ''Resident Evil: Extinction'' being billed on the official website and elsewhere as the final installment of the ''Resident Evil'' film series; on September 23, 2007, Rory Bruer, Sony's head of distribution explained, "It absolutely would not surprise me considering the success of the franchise that they find a way to come up with another. It's a real possibility."<ref name="usatoday1" /> Producer [[Jeremy Bolt]] also stated that while there was no intention of making a fourth film, that the third had been particularly well done and that Paul Anderson was talking with Sony about the possibility.<ref name="ign1" />  In June 2008, Anderson noted that negotiations were underway with Sony for creating the film.<ref name="mtv1" /> In December 2008, Anderson stated that he was working on the script.<ref name="ign2" /> The following year, it was announced that Sony was aiming to release ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' by August 27, 2010.<ref name="shock1" />

===Casting===
[[File:BorisKodjoeDec10.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Boris Kodjoe trained for six weeks to perform his own stunts. He dislocated his knee in the course of filming while trying to kick in a gate.<ref name="fearnet1" />]]
In September 2006, reports indicated that casting for the fourth film had begun, with [[Jensen Ackles]] being considered for the role of [[Leon S. Kennedy]].<ref name="bd2" />  Ali Larter missed seven episodes of filming the television show ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' in order to appear in the film.<ref name="LarterSetVisit"/> Before Wentworth Miller was cast as Chris Redfield, actor [[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]] auditioned for the role. Having never played the ''Resident Evil'' video games,<ref name="Miller"/> Miller began preparing for the role by searching the internet for images of Chris Redfield. Much to his surprise, he noticed how muscular the character was; with only three weeks to prep before shooting, he knew it was impossible to increase his muscle mass to that extent. He was shown video footage of the games and saw how he was visually different, especially in the first game. He did [[Aerobic exercise|cardio]] to build up [[endurance]].<ref name="Miller"/>  Miller described his interpretation on the character from the video game as, "He's definitely capable and heroic, but there's also something quite innocent. He was still freshly scrubbed, in a way, at the beginning of this horrifying journey." He described his take as the character in the film, "My Chris has been walking down this particular road for quite some time. The edges are sharper, and they’re way more jagged."<ref name="FangoriaMiller"/>

Shawn Roberts was originally going to audition for Chris Redfield before Miller accepted the role.<ref name="FangoriaRoberts"/> He went to audition for the role of Albert Wesker, a role previously played by [[Jason O'Mara]]. Describing the character Roberts said, "[He's the] Chairman of the Umbrella Corporation. He is in a position of power. He pretty much runs the world, and Alice is an annoyance. It's a whole process: I get to set and wardrobe gives me this big, long black jacket, and props comes over and gives me the dark glasses and the gloves. By the time you are all dressed you stand a little straighter, you walk a little differently. He's got everything going for him—he's super fast, super strong, has the ability to regenerate—it's all the elements from the game. That was one thing we all agreed on from the start: this character has to be for the fans."<ref name="fearnet2" /> Sienna Guillory reprises her role as Jill Valentine, who was last seen in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''.<ref name="bd1" /> She is featured briefly in a scene shown during the credits, setting up the [[Resident Evil: Retribution|sequel]].

===Cinematography and set design===
Anderson was shown footage of [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' which sold him on the idea to shoot ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' in [[digital 3D]]. He shot in [[high-definition video|high-definition]] with an [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 2.35:1<ref name="ColliderSetVisit"/> using Cameron's Fusion Camera System, or more specifically a Sony F35 camera.<ref name="latimes" /> The crew spent two weeks in [[pre-production]] learning the 3D camera system.<ref name="FangoriaDon"/> With a budget of about $60 million,<ref name="Barnes (2010)"/><ref name="Fritz (2010)"/><ref name="variety"/> [[principal photography]] took place for 55 days<ref name="ColliderSetVisit"/> from September 29, 2009<ref name="collider1" /> to December.<ref name="shock4" /> Filming in 3D added 20% to the budget.<ref name="SetVisitBolt"/> Roberts began filming his scenes on October 10, 2009.<ref name="fearnet2" /> The final showdown scene was filmed for about six days.<ref name="ColliderSetVisit"/> During production Jovovich accidentally shot out a $100,000 camera.<ref name="ComicCon"/>
[[File:Robarts East wing.JPG|thumb|right|[[Robarts Library]]'s exterior was used to portray the prison.<ref name="GlobalNational"/>]]
[[File:Uoft pharmacy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy]] was used to portray Umbrella Corporation's underground Tokyo headquarters.  Anderson said "It had a fantastic atrium that had these huge floating pill shapes in it. Inside the pills were conference rooms. We shot at night so there was no ambient light coming into the glass, and then with visual effects replaced the glass with concrete walls".<ref name="PopularMechanics"/>]]
For slow motion scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom [[high-speed camera]]s were used which filmed 200 [[frame rate|frames per second]].<ref name="celebritywonder"/> A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the ''Resident Evil 5'' game was recreated shot-by-shot for the film and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film.<ref name="FangoriaRoberts"/> The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers were not able to use existing equipment such as [[Steadicam]] rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a [[Segway PT|Segway]] to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot.<ref name="celebritywonder" /> Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]].<ref name="ComicCon"/> A 1983 [[Yakovlev Yak-52|Yak-52]] was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.<ref name="Plane"/>

The 3D cameras were unable to pick up anything shiny, such as [[stainless steel]], due to a flare. [[Set decorator]] Cal Loucks said that most items that looked metal were actually painted silver with special paint to remove its reflective quality. The saturation of colors also had to be changed to accustom the 3D cameras, which are "slow to pick up information". Loucks said, "It's a very restrictive color palette. For example, in this warehouse scene, we saturated the floors in a dark, dark charcoal, and we thought that was enough, but then the cameras showed them as still being too light.  So we had to add more and more black.  The reason I say it's too light is because we are putting more light onto these sets than we ever have before."<ref name="CalLoucks"/>

===Filming locations===
Principal photography was done mostly at [[Cinespace Film Studios]] in  Toronto, [[Ontario]].<ref name="Cinespace"/> Toronto police received hundreds of calls from concerned neighbors after a scene involving a burning plane crashed.<ref name="GlobalNational"/>  For the underwater scenes, [[cargo]] [[Intermodal container|shipping containers]] were cut and welded to make a giant tank on stage.<ref name="SetVisitBolt"/> The opening scene was filmed at Cinespace Film Studios.<ref name="celebritywonder"/> Interior scenes  of Umbrella Corporation's subterranean lair were filmed at the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy.<ref name="PopularMechanics"/> Robarts Library was used to portray exterior shots of a Los Angeles prison due to its resemblance to a prison, and other scenes were shot at [[University of Toronto Scarborough]].<ref name="GlobalNational"/> Scenes portraying an Alaskan [[aircraft boneyard]] were actually filmed at [[Oshawa Airport]]. A location depicting an Alaskan beach was filmed at [[Sandbanks Provincial Park]].<ref name="Sandbank"/>  [[Second unit]] was sent to Alaska to capture [[establishing shot]]s of the scenery.<ref name="FangoriaAnderson"/>

===Visual and special effects===
[[Visual effects]] were done by [[Rocket Science VFX]] and Mr. X Inc. Paul Jones served as the [[special effect]]s creator, who previously designed the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] character in ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''. The production team planned to use extras to portray 300 zombies at once, but time restraints prevented that. Around 150 zombies were eventually used and Mr. X Inc's visual effects supervisor, Dennis Berardi, added more in post-production.<ref name="FangoriaSetReport1"/> For Alice's clones they shot [[motion control photography]] for multiple passes of Jovovich. For the wide shots they took digital photo doubles.<ref name="FangoriaDennis"/> Visual effects production manager Eric Robertson described the look of the film, "interesting contrasts, pure whites, which is a staggering look. It's so clean and tight along with some real darkness too that may evoke a bit of a feel of ''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]''. So we've got the extremes, but it's definitely a unique look for this incarnation and it's been fun to see those looks."<ref name="shock3" /> A burned cityscape with ash and smoke in the sky was created to depict a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|postapocalyptic]] Los Angeles, in which most of the film is set. Bolt described this approach as, "In a world that has gone [[to hell in a handbasket]], there's no control and no fire service, so clearly, what's going to happen to LA is it's going to get burned."<ref name="FangoriaBolt"/>

The infected [[Doberman Pinscher|Doberman]]s from the games and previous films return, but are more advanced. The dogs wore a costume with prosthetics.<ref name="FangoriaPaulJones"/>  Anderson wanted to make the dogs in this film look "absolutely terrible".<ref name="FangoriaPaulJones"/> [[Computer-generated imagery|Computer effects]] were used to make the dog's jaw flare open, with tentacles coming out of their mouths similar to the dogs from the fourth and fifth video games.<ref name="shock2" /><ref name="CinemaBlend"/> Other creatures borrowed from the fifth video game are the "Majini" who are more intelligent and have [[mandible]]s and [[tentacle]]s coming out of their mouths, and "The Executioner" (named the Axeman in the film).<ref name="shock3" /><ref name="shock2" /><ref name="Executioner" />

==Release==
[[File:WonderCon2010 - Milla Jovovitch 2336.jpg|thumb|right|Milla Jovovich speaking at [[WonderCon|WonderCon 2010]] about the film.]]
In August 2009 it was announced that the film would be released on August 27, 2010,<ref name="kotaku1" /> but that December it was set back to January 14, 2011.<ref name="dreadcentral5" /> In January 2010, it was announced that the release date was moved to September 10, 2010.<ref name="shock6" /> [[Screen Gems]] paid [[Constantin Film]], Davis Films and Impact Pictures $52 million for the rights to distribute the film in North American and "most key foreign markets".<ref name="TheWrap"/>

On April 3, 2010, Anderson, Jovovich and Larter attended WonderCon for a ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' panel answering fan questions.<ref name="WonderCon"/>  On July 24, 2010, they attended the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] to promote the film.<ref name="ComicCon"/>

==Reception==

===Critical response===
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' was not screened in advance for critics.<ref name="screened" /> Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 23% based on the reviews of 95 critics, with a rating average of 4.1 out of 10. The site's consensus states "as dim-witted and lifeless as its undead antagonists, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' is a wholly unnecessary addition to the franchise."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_afterlife/| title= Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010)| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] | accessdate = July 31, 2011}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 37 based on 14 reviews, indicating "generally unvaforable reviews".<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil-afterlife/critic-reviews| title= Resident Evil: Afterlife Reviews | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = September 22, 2010 }}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B-" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="TheWrap" />

Michael Ordoña of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave it a positive review, noting the slower cut of the film and saying "the action is easier to read than in most films of the genre, and therefore more enjoyable. Anderson makes particular use of sets and locations to wring out more bang for the stereoscopic buck".<ref name="LATimesReview" /> Phelim O'Neill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film two stars out of five praising the use of 3D, while stating that the ''Resident Evil'' films "always look good and have well-staged action, but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination".<ref name="GuardianReview" /> ''[[Chicago Reader]]''{{'}}s Andrea Gronvall described the plot as "nearly indiscernible" but did call the film the "sleekest so far, thanks to 3D and star Milla Jovovich's body-hugging catsuit".<ref name="ChicagoReader" />

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "Cannibalizing [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|Thing]]'' and much of the sci-fi-horror canon, ''Afterlife'' is more moribund than its thronging undead".<ref name="NYTReview" /> David Edwards of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' compared it to ''Resident Evil: Extinction'', stating that the "results are even less impressive, which is saying quite something" and "only fans of the series will care with the film looking suspiciously like a series of barely connected action scenes and unimpressive 3D welded to a who-the-hell-cares? plot".<ref name="Daily Mirror review" /> [[Spill.com]] critics Corey Koleman and Co-Host 3000 gave the film a "Some ol' bullshit", the site's second lowest rating. They criticized the film's overuse of slow motion, lack of explanation of certain plot elements and long lapses in between action, but gave the film points for its cinematography, small bits of action, 3D and the special effects of the Axeman.<ref name="Spill"/> Andrew Barker of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' compared the film to the previous installment as "equally moribund, and perhaps even more shamelessly derivative". He compared Roberts' Wesker to [[Hugo Weaving]]'s [[Agent Smith]] from ''[[The Matrix]]'', calling it a "slipshod impression".<ref name="VarietyReview"/> A particularly scathing review came from Brian Orndorf of [[Dark Horizons]], who commented: "Perhaps the first 3D motion picture to simulate the experience of watching paint dry, ''Resident Evil: Afterlife'' is a dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life."<ref name="DarkHorizons" />
