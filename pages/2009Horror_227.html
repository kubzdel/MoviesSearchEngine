{{Advert|section|date=January 2015}}

In her castle on an isolated [[Cornwall|Cornish]] island, vampire noblewoman Morticia de'Ath (Pamela Kempthorne) and her zombie henchman, Grunt (Leon Hamilton), work with alchemist Dr. N. Sane (John Snelling) to discover a cure to grant vampires immunity to sunlight. Caught up in her plans are two bickering office workers Kevin Smallcock and Susan Swallows, and old world vampire hunter Professor Van Rental.

Along the way they encounter werewolves, demons, a seductive trio of vampire girls in nightgowns and the story culminates in a woodland battle with 100 medieval vampire soldiers and their commanding officer, a fey green-skinned battle demon.
