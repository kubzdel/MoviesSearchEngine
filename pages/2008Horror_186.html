'''''The Strangers'''''  is a 2008 American horror film written and directed by [[Bryan Bertino]]. Kristen ([[Liv Tyler]]) and James ([[Scott Speedman]]) are expecting a relaxing weekend at a family vacation home, but their stay turns out to be anything but peaceful, for three masked torturers leave Kristen and James struggling for survival. Writer-director Bertino was inspired by real-life events: the [[Manson family]] [[Tate murders]], a multiple homicide; the [[Keddie murders|Keddie Cabin Murders]], that occurred in California in 1981; and a series of [[Burglary|break-ins]] that occurred in his own neighborhood as a child. Made on a budget of $9 million, the film was shot on location in rural South Carolina in the fall of 2006.

Originally slated for a theatrical release in November 2007, it was postponed before a theatrical release on May 30, 2008. It grossed $82 million at the box office worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars have interpreted it as a criticism of the perceived safety of [[Pastoral#Pastoral theory|pastoral life]], as well as an exploration of [[Stranger danger|stranger-on-stranger]] violence. A sequel, titled ''[[The Strangers: Prey at Night]]'', was released ten years later on March 9, 2018.

==Plot==
The film opens with a "Based on True Events" message. James Hoyt and his girlfriend Kristen McKay arrive at James' remote childhood summer home, tired and irritable after a long evening at a friend's wedding reception. At the wedding, James proposed to Kristen and she refused. James calls his friend Mike and asks him pick him up in the morning. Shortly after 4 a.m., there is a loud knock at the door. A young blonde woman, whose face is hiding in the shadows, asks "Is Tamera here?" When told that she is at the wrong house, she leaves with the casual caveat that she will "See them later."

Due to the tension between them, James leaves to go for a drive and purchase a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor. It turned out to be the same blonde woman at the door from earlier. Unnerved, she retreats to the bedroom. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short due to battery shortage. Soon after plugging in her charger, she returns to the kitchen, where, unbeknownst to her, a man in a sack mask watches her from an adjacent hallway and vanishes as she turns around.

In the living room, Kristen notices the smoke alarm she left on the floor is now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house. Upon going to retrieve her cell phone from the wall charger, she finds it is cut in half, and begins to panic. When she hears a startling noise from the backyard, she arms herself with a kitchen knife, and opens the curtains to find the Man in Mask, staring at her along with a pound towards her. She stumbles into the hallway, and watches as the front door unlatches. When she goes to push the door closed, she sees the blonde woman outside, now in a doll mask. After locking the door, Kristen hides in the bedroom and hears the strangers outside banging violently against the walls of the house.

The noise eventually stops and James returns to the home. After she explains what has happened, he goes outside to the car to get his phone, whereupon he finds the car totalled and sees Dollface watching him from afar, speechless. The couple attempt to leave in James' car but another woman in a Pin-Up mask rear-ends them with a pick-up truck, forcing them to flee after encountering the Man in Mask. Back inside the house, Kristen and James find a shotgun and wait for the intruders in a bedroom. One of the strangers enters and put on a country record on the turntable, filling the house with music.

Mike arrives and realizes something is wrong after seeing the smashed car in the driveway along with the door wide open. He enters the house, and James, mistaking him for one of the strangers, shoots him in the head. Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves Kristen inside and encounters Pin-up Girl searching the backyard with a flashlight. When James tries to shoot her, the Man in Mask runs up towards him, and knocks him unconscious, discharging the gun in the process. Kristen hears the shot, and runs to the shed to find James after hearing a terrifying noise from behind her. She finds the radio, but Pin-Up Girl smashes it with an sledgehammer after hearing the sound static. Kristen carefully rushes back to the house, where she encounters Dollface, who taunts her with the household items. Then Dollface threatens her with a kitchen knife. Before Dollface could stab Kristen, James is violently thrown through the backdoor by the Man in Mask. James tells her to run but encounters Pin-Up Girl, blocking the front door leaving them no way out. Kristen attempts to leave but is incapacitated by the Man in Mask, leaving both James and Kristen unconscious.

James and Kristen awaken at dawn as the curtains are pulled, and find themselves tied to chairs in the living room with the strangers standing before them. Kristen asks, "Why are you doing this to us?" to which Dollface replies, "Because you were home." The strangers then unmask themselves to the couple offscreen, and take turns stabbing the couple in the stomach and chest with the same kitchen knife used to threaten Kristen. After untying them loose, the strangers leave them to die. As they drive away in the pick-up truck, they ride past two young [[Mormonism|Mormon]] boys on bicycles distributing [[Tract (literature)|religious tracts]] door-to-door. Dollface gets out of the truck and asks for a tract. One of the boys asks if she's a sinner and she replies, "Sometimes." The strangers drive away, as Pin-Up Girl states, "It'll be easier next time." The two boys come upon the house with the door wide open and discover the chaotic scene, including the bodies of Kristen, James, and Mike inside. One of the boys approach Kristen's body, and as he reaches out to her, she wakes up and screams revealing she is still alive.

==Themes==
Film scholar Kevin Wetmore noted the film's portrayal of violence as a reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: "Death is a random act in post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] horror—the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the cliché goes. Unlike in eighties [[slasher film|slasher]] horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); [here], death is random and unrelated to one's behavior."{{Sfn|Wetmore|2012 |p=83}}

In ''The Horror Show Guide: The Ultimate Frightfest of Movies'', Mike Mayo noted the film's "grim realism," writing that the main characters "could have wandered out of a gloomy [[Ingmar Bergman]] film," ultimately branding the film as an example of "naturalistic domestic horror" akin to [[Michael Haneke]]'s ''[[Funny Games (1997 film)|Funny Games]]''.{{Sfn|Mayo| 2013|p=334}}

The film has also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as highlighting "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," as well as for its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: "''The Strangers'', as many horror films do&nbsp;... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing ''The Strangers'' 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by [[Louis Wirth]]."{{Sfn|Simpson|2013|pages=192–193}}

In his book ''Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film'' (2014), scholar Tony Williams notes the film's setting within a 1970s-era home as representative of an "American tradition of violence that is random and without any coherent explanation." Additionally, Williams reads the three masked assailants as metaphors for the "repressed and unresolved tensions affecting the couple inside the house."{{Sfn|Williams|2014|p=294}}

===Screenplay and inspiration===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|bgcolor=cornsilk|quote=I was thinking about the [[Tate murders]] and realizing that these detailed descriptions had painted a story of what it was like in the house with the victims. But none of the victims knew about the Manson family or why it was happening to them. So, I got really fascinated with telling the victims' tale. And not filling it in with an FBI profile and not filling it in with finding out that somebody's grandmother beat them and now they want to kill everybody. You read obituaries every day where someone is killed for a random reason. Yes, we may eventually find out why, but sometimes they don't.|source=Bryan Bertino, on his inspiration for the film.{{Sfn|Simpson|2013|p=187}}}}
Writer-director Bryan Bertino wrote the screenplay which was originally titled ''The Faces'';<ref name="production" /> it was the third screenplay he had ever written.<ref name=moments/> Bertino had a particular interest in the horror genre, noting how one can connect to an audience by scaring them, and would state in subsequent interviews that he grew up watching horror films.<ref name=moments/> In particular, he stated he was significantly inspired by thriller films of the 1970s while writing the screenplay,<ref name="production" /> and envisioned a film that "put the audience in the world of the victims."<ref name=moments/>

In interviews, Bertino stated he was "very impressed" with some of the theories circulating on the Internet about the "true events" the movie is allegedly based on, but said that his main inspiration was the [[true crime]] book ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]'' about the  [[Charles Manson#Family crimes|Manson Family murders]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=6242 |title=Interview: The Strangers' Bryan Bertino (Pt. 2) |author=Turek, Ryan |date=May 26, 2008 |publisher=Shock Till You Drop |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |archivedate=December 28, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228095340/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=6242 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> some journalists speculated that the film was also inspired by the unsolved [[Keddie murders|Keddie Cabin Murders of 1981]] that occurred in a small vacation community in California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref name="shock">{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=950 |title=Never Talk to Strangers |author=Turek, Ryan |date=August 1, 2007 |publisher=Shock Till You Drop |archivedate=December 10, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210181652/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/950-excl-never-talk-to-strangers |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/03/04/the-strangers-and-the-real-life-horrors-that-inspired-a-slasher-masterpiece |work=Birth.Movies.Death. |title=THE STRANGERS And The Real-Life Horrors That Inspired A Slasher Masterpiece |date=March 4, 2016 |author=Hayes, Britt |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802210057/http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/03/04/the-strangers-and-the-real-life-horrors-that-inspired-a-slasher-masterpiece |archivedate=August  2, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The film's premise has been compared by some film critics to the French horror film ''[[Them (2006 film)|Them]]'', released two years earlier, which also features a couple terrorized by strangers in their remote home.{{Sfn|West|2016|p=140}}

Bertino entered the screenplay for ''The Strangers'' into a screenwriting contest, after which he sold its directorial rights to Universal Pictures.<ref name=moments/>  

===Casting===
When casting the two leading actors in the film, Bertino sought [[Liv Tyler]] for the role of Kristen.<ref name=production/> Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, accepted the part after being impressed by the script, which she read while on a flight from Japan to Los Angeles:<ref name=door>{{cite av media|title=Strangers at the Door|format=[[Blu-ray]]|work=The Strangers|medium=Documentary short|publisher=Scream Factory|year=2018|orig-year=2008}}</ref> "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled out for you, and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew it would be interesting to act that."<ref name="production" /> Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".<ref name="production" />

In casting the three masked intruders, Bertino chose Australian [[fashion model]] [[Gemma Ward]] for the part of Dollface, feeling she had the exact "look" he had imagined; Ward was officially cast in the film in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/gemma-ward-one-strangers/|work=[[Empire magazine|Empire]]|title=Gemma Ward's One Of The Strangers|date=September 1, 2006| accessdate=March 9, 2017}}</ref> In preparing for the role, Ward read Vincent Bugioisi's ''Helter Skelter'' for inspiration.{{Sfn|Simpson|2013|p=188}} Kip Weeks was then chosen as the Man in the Mask, and television actress [[Laura Margolis]], who found the script to be a real "page turner", was cast in the part of Pin-Up Girl.<ref name="production" /> In retrospect, Bertino said he chose the three actors based on their abilities to convey their characters in spite of the fact that their faces remain unseen onscreen.<ref name=moments/>

===Filming===
[[File:Mark Romanek Tokyo Intl Filmfest 2010.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Mark Romanek]] (''pictured'') was originally attached to direct the project but after he backed out, Bertino took over.]]
Bertino had not initially planned on directing ''The Strangers'', and had been disconnected from the project after selling directorial rights to Universal Pictures.<ref name=moments/> Both [[Justin Lin]]<ref name=moments/> and [[Mark Romanek]] were attached to direct, but eventually backed out.{{Sfn|Vander Kaay|Fernandez-Vander Kaay|2016|p=157}} Approximately two years after Bertino had sold the screenplay, Universal passed the project onto its subsidiary, [[Rogue Pictures]], who approached Bertino to direct the project, despite his lack of experience.<ref name=moments/><ref name=ca>{{cite web|work=MoviesOnline|title=Bryan Bertino Interview, The Strangers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708095631/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12591.html|archivedate=July 8, 2008|deadurl=yes|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12591.html}}</ref>

On a $9 million budget, filming for ''The Strangers'' began on October 10, 2006, and finished in early 2007. It was shot on location roughly 10 miles outside of [[Florence, South Carolina]], and the {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} house interior was constructed by a [[set design|set crew]].<ref>{{cite AV media|title=The Elements of Terror: Making The Strangers|medium=DVD|date=October 2008|publisher=Universal Studios}}</ref> Though the film takes place in 2005, the house itself was deliberately constructed with an architecture reminiscent of 1970s [[ranch house]]s and dressed in furnishings applicable to the era.<ref name="production" /> Bertino based the house on the types of homes common where he had grown up in rural [[Texas]].<ref name=moments/> The property was located on the outskirts of [[Timmonsville, South Carolina]]. Despite weather complications, the film was largely shot in chronological order.<ref name="production" />

During production, it was reported that Liv Tyler came down with [[tonsillitis]] due to the extensive screaming the role required her to do.<ref name="production">{{cite web| work=Hollywood Jesus| url=http://hollywoodjesus.com/movies/strangers/notes.pdf| title=''The Strangers'' Production Notes provided by Universal Pictures| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030105847/http://hollywoodjesus.com/movies/strangers/notes.pdf| archivedate=October 30, 2012| accessdate=September 9, 2011| deadurl=yes| df=mdy-all}} [http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=4763 Alternate link] at ''Cinema Review''.</ref> Tyler would later recall it being the most difficult film she had ever worked on, "both physically and emotionally."<ref name=door/> According to Laura Margolis, who played the Pin-Up Girl, Tyler also specifically requested that she not see her mask prior to filming: "I got strict instructions not to let Liv see me in my mask before we shot," Margolis recalled. "The first scene that I shot was stalking [her] outside of the barn. I had been told that she really wanted to be scared. She didn’t want to have to fake it, and so it was my responsibility to really scare her. So we shot that scene, I ran at her, she started actually screaming, and then she kicked me away."<ref name=collis>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|title=Liv Tyler wanted to be genuinely terrified while making The Strangers|author=Collis, Clark|accessdate=March 8, 2018|date=March 6, 2018|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/03/06/the-strangers-liv-tyler-blu-ray/}}</ref>

The masks featured in the film were chosen by Bertino, who wanted them to appear as though the killers "could have picked them up at any store."<ref name=moments/>

===Post-production===
Film editor [[Kevin Greutert]] was hired to edit the film; at the time, he recently finished editing ''[[Saw III]]''.<ref name=cuts>{{cite av media|people=[[Kevin Greutert|Greutert, Kevin]]|title=Deep Cuts: Editing The Strangers|year=2018|format=Blu-ray|publisher=Scream Factory|work=The Strangers|medium=Documentary short}}</ref> Several changes were made to the film during post-production, primarily regarding the conclusion: In the screenplay and the original footage shot, the three masked strangers reveal their faces on camera.<ref name=cuts/> After the sequence in which Kristen and James are stabbed, the strangers wander around the house, cleaning up parts of the crime scene before dressing into Kristen and James's clothes.<ref name=cuts/> Following test screenings, it was decided by the producers that the strangers' faces should remain unseen to the audience, which required the sequences following the stabbing to be excised.<ref name=cuts/> 

==Music==
A musical score, consisting of 19 pieces composed by score producer [[tomandandy]], was released on May 27, 2008, and was distributed by [[Lakeshore Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-strangers-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000789462|work=AllMusic|title=The Strangers [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}</ref> The album was received with generally positive reviews by critics. "It's a creepy score for what appears to be a movie that will make you jump as well as make sure that the doors are locked at night," writes reviewer Jeff Swindoll.<ref>{{cite web
