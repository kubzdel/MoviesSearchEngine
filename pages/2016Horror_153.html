==Plot==
Drug fiend James flees from a farmhouse and escapes into the woods. A screaming woman tries to follow, but she is shot and set on fire by Vincent and his ally Simon. Deputy Daniel Carter finds James crawling in the road and rushes him to the local hospital, which has been largely abandoned following a fire, where his estranged wife Allison Fraser works as a nurse. At the hospital are Dr. Richard Powell, nurse Beverly, intern Kim, pregnant patient Maggie, her grandfather Ben, and patient Cliff; with the staff at the hospital working as a skeleton crew. Daniel discovers an entranced Beverly murdering Cliff, her face flayed of skin. Beverly moves toward Daniel who shoots her dead. Daniel collapses due to a seizure and experiences a strange vision.

While everyone struggles to figure out what happened with Beverly, [[State Trooper|state trooper]] Mitchell enters the hospital to collect James after discovering a bloody scene at the farmhouse. Daniel goes outside to call in Beverly’s death from his patrol car, but is confronted by a robed cultist who wounds him. He manages to return to the hospital as cultists surround the building. Daniel and Mitchell rush into James’ room when they hear him screaming. They find Beverly’s corpse has transformed into a tentacled creature as Daniel and Mitchell rescue James and lock Beverly in the room. In the lobby, Vincent and Simon enter and hold the group at gunpoint, demanding to get to James. James takes Maggie hostage to protect himself and stabs Powell, who falls to the floor. The Beverly-Creature emerges from Beverly's room and devours Mitchell. Vincent and Simon kill the Beverly-Creature and regroup with the others in the lobby, setting Mitchell's body on fire. Vincent and Simon accompany Daniel to retrieve a shotgun from a patrol car, while Allison ventures into the basement to collect medical supplies for delivering Maggie’s baby. Powell rises from the ground and captures Allison. On discovering that Allison is missing, Daniel and Vincent search for her and find photographs and files indicating Powell was the cult’s leader. Powell phones Daniel, taunting him and mentioning the vision Daniel experienced while unconscious.

Kim and Ben stay with Maggie while Daniel, Vincent, and Simon interrogate James. James explains that Powell has the power to transform people. The three men force James to come with them downstairs. Allison regains consciousness on an operating table where Powell explains he has found a way to defy death after the loss of his daughter Sarah. Having cut off his face, Powell shows Allison that something now grows inside her. Daniel, Vincent, Simon, and James find a hidden area in the basement and end up surrounded by deformed corpses brought back to life. One of the creatures kills James as the other three men get separated.

As Maggie enters labor, Kim hesitates to perform a [[Caesarean section|C-section]]. As Ben pleads with Kim, Maggie stands and slits his throat, revealing she is carrying Dr. Powell’s child. Kim hides as cultists enter the building and Maggie leaves. Daniel finds Allison in the operating room pregnant. Looking again at Allison, he sees an Allison-Creature with tentacles extending from her body. Powell’s voice speaks to Daniel, who finally attacks his wife's mutated remains with an axe. Daniel is transported to a morgue room with a glowing triangle on the wall. Powell’s voice tells Daniel that he found the ability to conquer life and death. Powell promises that Daniel can have his child back if he is willing to die first.

Maggie appears and stabs Daniel. Powell appears without any skin in front of the triangle as Maggie kneels before him. Powell recites an incantation before the triangle as a now frightened Maggie's torso explodes, as she births the reborn Sarah in the form of a beast. Vincent and Simon arrive and battle the beast. The Sarah-Creature envelops Vincent, but he covers it in [[isopropyl alcohol]], allowing Simon to set them both on fire with a flare. As Powell begins transforming, he tells Daniel he can be with Allison if he gives himself to the abyss. Daniel refuses and tackles him, leading both men to tumble into the void. Meanwhile, the Sarah-Creature pursues Simon, who escapes and is teleported back to the hospital to reunite safely with Kim. Daniel and Allison are shown holding hands in another world beneath a black pyramid.

Since 2000, the Canadian film groups referring to themselves as Astron-6 began creating comedic horror films.<ref name="exclaim-interview">{{cite web|url=https://exclaim.ca/film/article/the_void_jeremy_gillespie_steven_kostanski_suicide_squad_guillermo_del_toro|work=Exclaim!|title=Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski Explain How 'Suicide Squad' and Guillermo del Toro Helped Create 'The Void'|accessdate=22 February 2018|date=31 March 2017|last=Lindsay|first=Cam}}</ref> Their films included ''[[Manborg]]'', ''[[Father's Day (2011 film)|Father's Day]]'' and ''[[The Editor (film)|The Editor]]''.<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> ''The Void'' differed from the previous films being serious in tone, which led the group to not present it under the Astron-6 name.<ref name="exclaim-interview" />

Jeremy Gillespie was initially working at Pinewood on a floor below where [[Guillermo del Toro]] was working on the unfinished film ''At the Mountains of Madness'', recalling hearing him state that he wanted to do a [[HP Lovecraft]] film in a way that hadn't been done before.<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> After hearing this, Gillespie felt that this "sort of got the wheels in my mind working, trying to think of what that might be. So that was sort of where the imagery was birthed. All of this stuff relating to pyramids and triangles is left ambiguous, for the audience to interpret as they would, intentionally."<ref name="exclaim-interview" />

Gillespie and Kostanski managed to crowdfund the money they needed to build the practical creatures that appear onscreen effects.<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> Other assistance came from the team working on [[David Ayer]]'s ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' which was shooting in Toronto.<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> Gillespie served as assistant art director and Kostanski as a special makeup effects artist on the film, which led to members of the special effects team on ''Suicide Squad'' to work on ''The Void''.<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> Gillespie later declared ''The Void'' as a difficult production, noting that "Every single thing was the biggest challenge. It was a soul-crushing nightmare. Everybody was pushed to the limit on this movie. The one ray of hope we got was the cast, which came together at the last second. They were easy to deal with."<ref name="exclaim-interview" /> ''The Void'' was set to shoot in Canada on November 17, 2015.<ref name="sd-salt-xyz">{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/salt-xyz-enter-horror-the-void/5095980.article|work=Screen Daily|title=AFM: Salt, XYZ enter horror 'The Void'|date=October 27, 2015|accessdate=April 5, 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Andreas}}</ref>

==Reception==
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], it currently holds a 73% approval rating based on 56 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Void'' offers a nostalgic rush for fans of low-budget 1980s horror — and legitimate thrills for hardcore genre enthusiasts of all ages."<ref name=RT>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_void_2017|title=The Void|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 7, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], ''The Void'' received a rating of 62 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-void |title=The Void |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= April 7, 2017}}</ref>

[[Kim Newman]] (''[[Screen Daily]]'')  compared the film to the previous works of ''Bio-Cop'' from ''[[ABCs of Death 2]]'' and ''[[Manborg]]'', stating that directors "remain in [[pastiche]] mode, but tone down the humour to try for serious suspense and [[Lovecraftian horror]] - with a pleasing reliance on memorably gruesome physical effects rather than [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]." Newman concluded that the film "offers good shock/uck moments and a nicely unpredictable plot, even if a few crucial relationships are sketchily established, slightly undermining audience investment in the horrors."<ref name="sd-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-void-review/5114839.article|work=[[Screen Daily]]|title='The Void': Review|date=February 13, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2017|last=Newman|first=Kim|authorlink=Kim Newman|archiveurl=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170404043724/http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-void-review/5114839.article|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref>

''[[Fangoria]]'' gave the film a positive review, specifically praising that "practical effects are not obscured, not glimpsed partially through a flashing light or a shaky handicam. They’re showcased front and center, with the confidence of a team that knows their monsters have more weight and impact than the myriad CGI scares that have become the standard in modern horror." and that it was a film that "demands multiple viewings."<ref name="fangoria review">{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/fantastic-fest-2016-the-void-film-review/|work=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=April 3, 2017|title=Fantastic Fest 2016: “The Void” (Film Review)|date=September 23, 2016|first=Elijah|last=Taylor}}</ref>

The ''[[Globe & Mail]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, critiquing the plot "hard to follow" and that the creatures in the film "are low-lit, which probably has more to do with budget realities than aesthetic choice" and that the film was "unsettling and not jokey at all, the hell of The Void will be heaven to some."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/the-void-a-slasher-flick-made-just-for-fans-of-good-old-fashioned-gore/article34498025/|work=[[Globe & Mail]]|title=The Void: A slasher flick made just for fans of good old-fashioned gore|last=Wheeler|first=Brad|accessdate=April 4, 2017|date=March 31, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404232206/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/the-void-a-slasher-flick-made-just-for-fans-of-good-old-fashioned-gore/article34498025/|archivedate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'' found that the directors were still "operating in their referential comfort zone" with the film being "a savvy mashup of at least four John Carpenter pictures." and that it was still "its own entity: an effective, resourceful nightmare that convinces you the apocalypse is clawing just out of sight, beyond the edge of the screen."<ref name="now review">{{cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews/the-void-is-chock-full-of-imaginative-thrills/|work=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]|accessdate=April 5, 2017|title=The Void is chock full of imaginative thrills|date=March 29, 2017|first=Norman|last=Wilner}}</ref>

''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film a three stars out of five rating, and commented that the story of the film, stating that the "central story hinges on a series of outlandish coincidences, too many of the cast of characters struggle to make an impact, and the pacing is a tad too ponderous to really grip."<ref name="empire-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/void/review/|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|title=The Void Review|date=March 28, 2017|last=Hewett|first=Chris|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> The review found that as the film became more close to a [[creature feature]], "the directors’ love of old-school, honest-to-goodness, practical FX is a huge boon" and the directors are "worth keeping an eye on", as they "know their way around an arresting image, whether it’s a group of masked figures eerily lit by the cold, flashing light of a cop car, or a killer nonchalantly sliding a scalpel into someone’s eye".<ref name="empire-review" />
