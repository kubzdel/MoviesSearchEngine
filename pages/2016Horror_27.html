==Plot==
Four privileged siblings Brie, Daniel, Crew and, Jess, family has always come first. But when Crew (Daniel DiTomasso) invites his girlfriend Sara (Kate French) into the family, distrust begins to bubble between the siblings. Seeing Sara as a threat, Brie grows spiteful and suspicious that she is being replaced… That is until the night Crew attempts to murder her in their family house. Traumatized, Brie is sent to a mental facility where she is tormented by hallucinations of Crew from the night of the attack. But when the visions begin to bleed into reality, Brie starts to fear that it's not just her sanity that’s in danger, and she flees the facility. In a frantic attempt to return to her remaining siblings and warn them, Brie begins to uncover a trail of gory, sinister secrets that leads her to question whether she knows her family as well as she thought.<ref>http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/trailer-fiona-dourif-plays-a-twisted-family-game-in-blood-is-blood-147</ref><ref>http://www.fangoria.com/new/exclusive-teaser-fiona-dourif-in-blood-is-blood/</ref>
