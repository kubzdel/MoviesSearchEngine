'''''Resident Evil''''' is a 2002 [[horror film#Subgenres|action horror film]]<ref name="Worldwide"/> written and directed by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] and produced by [[Bernd Eichinger]] and [[Jeremy Bolt]]. The film stars [[Milla Jovovich]] and [[Michelle Rodriguez]].  It is the first installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is loosely based on the [[Capcom]] [[survival horror]] [[Resident Evil|video game series of the same name]]. Alongside Jovovich and Rodriguez, it also stars [[Eric Mabius]], [[James Purefoy]], [[Martin Crewes]], and [[Colin Salmon]]. 

Borrowing elements from the video games ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', the film follows [[amnesia|amnesiac]] heroine [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and a band of [[Umbrella Corporation]] commandos as they attempt to contain the outbreak of the T-virus at a secret underground facility. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office success, grossing more than $100 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Underneath Raccoon City exists a [[genetic research]] facility called the Hive, owned by the [[Umbrella Corporation]]. A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's [[artificial intelligence]], the [[Red Queen and White Queen|Red Queen]], seals the Hive and kills everyone inside.

[[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] awakens  naked in the bathroom of a deserted mansion with amnesia. She dresses, checks the mansion, and is subdued by an unknown person. A group of Sanitation Team commandos led by James Shade breaks into the mansion and arrests Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. The group travels to the underground train under the mansion that leads to the Hive, where they find Spence. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence are security guards for a Hive entrance under the disguise of a couple living in the mansion. Five hours prior, the Red Queen had shut down the entire facility and killed everyone inside, and also caused Spence and Alice's amnesia by flooding the mansion with nerve gas.

At the Queen's chamber, a laser defense system  kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's urgent pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables the Red Queen systems, and the power fails, opening all of the doors in the Hive. This releases the zombified staff and containment units containing Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. When everyone regroups, they are ambushed by a horde of zombies and a gunfight ensues. J.D. perishes as the group becomes overwhelmed. A bitten Rain retreats with Kaplan and Spence; Matt becomes separated from Alice, who starts regaining her memories. 

Matt looks for information about his sister Lisa and finds her zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains he and Lisa were environmental activists, and Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments. Alice remembers she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Queen's chamber, and the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit. To force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown. As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before getting killed. The group reaches safety, but Kaplan is bitten and separated.

Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. Spence remembers he stole and released the virus. He hid the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health is fading and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.

On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding on the train and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing her head to hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open and a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis Program]].

Some time later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table, with no memory of what happened since her capture. After escaping, she goes outside to find Raccoon City [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|abandoned and ruined]]. Alice arms herself with a shotgun from an abandoned police car as the camera pans out.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
Constantin Film bought the movie rights for ''Resident Evil'' in January 1997, and they hired screenwriter [[Alan B. McElroy]] to write the first version of script for the film. May 1998 issue of PlayStation magazine (PSN) had an article titled ''Resident Evil: The Movie'', which was about McElroy's script. It included plot synopsis and description of several scenes from it. Described as being action and horror packed, and also very violent, the script was similar to the original game even though some changes were made. For example there was no mention of Umbrella corporation and STARS. Instead the plot was about special forces team which is sent by government into the Raccoon forest to rescue some scientist from the mansion laboratory, some time after a S.W.A.T team disappeared inside the forest after they were send to investigate strange murders of campers and park rangers. The special forces team included all the characters from the game; [[Albert Wesker]], [[Chris Redfield]], [[Jill Valentine]], [[Barry Burton]], [[Rebecca Chambers (character)|Rebecca Chambers]]. Script also included all the monsters from the game, like zombies and zombie dogs, giant spiders and wasps, tyrant and others, and the team would have to fight against each of them. McElroy's script was rejected for some reason, so several other versions of the script were written by other writers. In 1998 [[George A. Romero]] was hired and he wrote first draft of his version of the script in October of that year.<ref>https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/constantin-buys-evil-rights-1117433527/</ref><ref>http://www.aintitcool.com/node/979</ref><ref>http://www.crimson-head.com/apps/forums/topics/show/13319068-alan-mcelroy-resident-evil-script</ref><ref>Fangoria #171, April 1998</ref>

In 1999, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Capcom]] [[Greenlight|greenlit]] a ''Resident Evil'' film with Romero signed on as the [[Film director|film's director]] and [[screenplay]] writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the ''Resident Evil'' video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an [[Advertising|ad campaign]] for ''Biohazard 2'' (''[[Resident Evil 2]]'') in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource.  Romero's screenplay was based on the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and included characters from the video games. Chris and Jill were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry, Rebecca, [[Ada Wong]], and Wesker were to also appear. The ending to the film would have been similar to the ''best'' ending to the first ''Resident Evil'' game.<ref>{{cite web | title = Resident Evil Original Screenplay | publisher = Dailyscript.com | url = http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/resident_evil_romero.html |last1= Romero |first1= George A. |authorlink= George A.

In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with ''DGA'' magazine that "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So I think they just never liked my script."<ref name="TNMC">{{cite news| title= TNMC Movie News: Resident Evil| publisher= tnmc.org| date= 1999-11-29| url= http://www.tnmc.org/gnews/residentevil.shtml| accessdate= 2006-01-27| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060210093812/http://www.tnmc.org/gnews/residentevil.shtml| archivedate= 2006-02-10| df= }}</ref> As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.<ref name="TNMC" />

In 2002 Fangoria #211 interview, Romero also explained how he worked with young executive of Constantin Film who was a fan of the games, but head of the company didn't even know what video game was and didn't understand it, and he wanted something "more prestigious", while Romero wrote his script to be dark and confined action horror which took place inside the mansion and labs where characters would fight against almost all of the creatures from the game. He wrote total of five or six different drafts, but then he was fired from the project. [[Paul W.S. Anderson]] wanted to write the script for the game before Romero was originally hired. Anderson still wanted to write the script and he wrote what he said was terrible ripoff of ''Resident Evil'', script titled ''Undead'' which just like his final film included mansion, underground laboratories, genetic experiments and big corporation. But when Romero's version was rejected, studio and producers went to Anderson and choose his screenplay which he changed into the script for ''Resident Evil''.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_211/Fangoria_211_djvu.txt</ref><ref name="TNMC" />

In late 2000, Anderson was announced as director and writer, and ''Resident Evil'' re-entered pre-production stages.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Info & Tidbits On Resident Evil |publisher=[[Flixster]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/about.php |accessdate=2007-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205235505/http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/about.php |archivedate=2007-12-05 |df= }}</ref>  Anderson stated the film would not include any tie-ins with the video game series as "under-performing movie tie-ins are too common and ''Resident Evil'', of all games, deserved a good celluloid representation".<ref>{{cite web| title= Resident Evil Director explains character and story line changes.

===Critical reaction===
{{Anchor|Critical response|Critics}}
''Resident Evil'' received a 34% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 124 reviews.<ref name="RT Reviews">{{cite web| title= Resident Evil (2002)| url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil/| accessdate= 6 January 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore"> {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

[[Robert K. Elder]] from the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated: the film "updates the zombie genre with an anti-corporate message while still scaring its audience and providing heart-pounding action",<ref name="RT Reviews" /> while Owen Gleiberman from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted: the film is as "impersonal in its relentlessness as the video-game series that inspired it".<ref name="RT Reviews" />

Both ''Resident Evil'' and the sequel appear on [[Roger Ebert]]'s most hated films list, published in 2005.<ref name="Ebert">{{cite news | date= 2005-08-11 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | authorlink = Roger Ebert | title= Ebert's Most Hated | publisher= [[Chicago Sun Times]] | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/COMMENTARY/50808002| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> In his review, Ebert describes ''Resident Evil'' as a zombie movie set in the 21st century, where "large metallic objects make crashing noises just by being looked at", and he criticizes the dialogue for being a series of commands and explanations with no "small talk".<ref>{{cite news | date= 2002-03-15 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | authorlink = Roger Ebert |title= Resident Evil| publisher= rogerebert.suntimes.com| url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020315/REVIEWS/203150304/1023| accessdate= 2007-12-02}}</ref> [[The New York Times]]' Stephen Holden awarded Resident Evil 1.5 stars out of 5 saying that "it has a frantic staccato that is more game-oriented than cinematic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil|title=Resident Evil|publisher=}}</ref>

In 2014, filmmaker [[James Cameron]] named ''Resident Evil'' his biggest guilty pleasure.<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22uz4m/i_am_james_cameron_ama/cgqmrpn | title = NDhome comments on I am James Cameron.

==Relationship to the games==
Various elements are borrowed from numerous video games including ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'',<ref name="DVD" /> where Alice's character awakes in [[Raccoon City]] Hospital with a viral outbreak occurring in the city. There are several references to characters and organizations such as the [[Umbrella Corporation]], the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]] program, the underground train bearing the moniker "Alexi-5000" a reference to ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica]]''{{'}}s villain [[Alexia Ashford]] (the train is from ''Resident Evil 2'', but in the game it reads "Galaxie-5000" instead of "Alexi-5000") and a police cruiser, from which Alice takes out a [[shotgun]], has a "[[Special Tactics and Rescue Service|S.T.A.R.S.]]" logo on the hood.<ref name="DVD" /> [[Jason Isaacs]] appears in the film as an uncredited masked surgeon (which is a reference to [[William Birkin]]). The character of [[Dr. Sam Isaacs|Dr. Isaacs]] (played by [[Iain Glen]]) in the film's sequels is based on him.<ref name="DVD">{{cite video| people= Paul W. S. Anderson| title= ''Resident Evil Commentary''| medium= DVD| publisher= Sony Entertainment|date= 2002}}</ref>

Other references to the first game include Alice examining the [[Arklay Research Facility#Spencer Mansion in other media|mansion]] by going outside; crows are visible for a moment. Crows are minor enemies that the player encounters throughout each game.<ref name="DVD" /> Alice finds a picture of her wedding day with Spence, which is the same style as the photos in the first version of the ''Resident Evil'' game: in black and white with the foreground image noticeably [[Photo manipulation#Photoshopping|spliced]] onto the background.<ref name="DVD" /> On the newspaper at the end of the film, the words ''"Horror in Raccoon City! More Victims Dead!"'' are shown in the upper right corner. This is a reference to the same newspaper in the censored opening of the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' game and the prologue chapter for the ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)#Novelization|Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy]]'' novel.<ref name="DVD" /> Near the beginning of the film, Alice examines a statue after the wind blows its cover off. This statue is similar in design to one in the mansion of the first game.<ref name="DVD" />

When returning to the Red Queen's chamber, Kaplan points out that the four bodies of the group's dead crew from the Glass Hallway Trap sequence are gone. This is a reference to the games, where the bodies of enemies disappear.<ref name="DVD" /> When the survivors make their escape from the Hive with a countdown as they fight the final boss, this is a reference to the ''Resident Evil'' game which ends with a five-minute countdown, during which the boss must be defeated.<ref name="DVD" />

A faux newspaper created by [[Screen Gems]] for ''Apocalypse'', ''The Raccoon City Times'', indicates hours after the initial outbreak when creatures began appearing in the Arklay Mountains feasting on victims.  This is similar to the opening of the first video game.<ref>[http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/residentevilapocalypse/site/raccooncitynews.pdf Raccoon City Times] - sonypictures.com {{Retrieved|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}</ref>

Anderson has stated that the film's [[camera angle]]s and several shots allude to the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the security guard.<ref name="DVD" /> These include a scene near the beginning where there is a close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the [[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|first game]].<ref name="DVD" /> In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.<ref name="DVD" />
