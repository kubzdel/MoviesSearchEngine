== Reception ==

A half-point out of a possible five was given to the film by Jon Condit of [[Dread Central]], who concluded, "The sorry fact is that ''Curse of the Zodiac'' is a total mess".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/curse-zodiac-dvd#axzz31djD5jg1|title = ''Curse of the Zodiac'' (DVD)|last = Condit|first = Jon|publisher = [[Dread Central]]|date = 29 May 2007|website = dreadcentral.com|accessdate = 13 May 2014}}</ref> David Johnson of [[DVD Verdict]] heavily criticized ''Curse of the Zodiac'', writing, "The movie plays out like this: [[Zodiac Killer]] wanders around, the camera shakes a lot, he kills a girl, the camera shakes a lot, the psychic gets a headache and has a vision of the crime scene, the camera shakes a lot, Zodiac calls the journalist and talks trash, the camera shakes a lot and repeat x4. Even if you're able to penetrate the insane editing, the narrative within will almost certainly bore your migraine-having ass. Add to that, the acting is universally atrociousâ€”the scenes with the psychic and her boyfriend are a case study on how to miss cues and flub lines".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/curseofthezodiac.php|title = ''Curse of the Zodiac''|last = Johnson|first = David|publisher = [[DVD Verdict]]|date = 25 May 2007|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 13 May 2014}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]]'s Brian W. Collins included ''Curse of the Zodiac'' on his 10 Worst Horror Films of 2007 list, in which he stated, "Not getting a single detail right about the Zodiac (other than the setting) is the least of its problems. It took effort to even get through the entire film, which consisted mainly of 3 scenes repeated over and over (killer taunts the cop, killer taunts the girl, killer kills some hippies we have never seen before)".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/10782/bcs-top-10-best-worst-list-of-2007/|title = BC's Top 10 Best & Worst List of 2007!|last = Collins|first = Brian|publisher = [[Bloody Disgusting]]|date = 29 December 2007|website = bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate = 13 May 2014}}</ref> Garrett and Sean Neil [[Something Awful]] awarded a near "perfect" score of -49/-50, and described the film as nothing more than "a twisted labyrinth of spinning, out-of-focus cameras and pointless gibberish".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.somethingawful.com/movie-reviews/curse-zodiac/1/|title = ''Curse of the Zodiac''|last = Neil|first = Garrett and Sean|publisher = [[Something Awful]]|date = 10 May 2014|website = www.somethingawful.com|accessdate = 13 May 2014}}</ref>
