==Plot==

A [[Detroit]] college student, Jaime "Jay" Height, goes on a date with her new boyfriend, Hugh. At the movies, Hugh points out a girl whom Jay says she cannot see. Afraid, he asks that they leave. On another date, Hugh and Jay have sex in his car, but afterwards he incapacitates her with [[chloroform]]. She wakes up tied to a wheelchair. Hugh explains that she will be pursued by an entity that only she can see, which can take the appearance of any person. Although it only moves at a walking pace, it will always know where she is and will be constantly approaching, and if it catches Jay, it will kill her and pursue the previous person to have passed it on: Hugh. After they see a naked woman walking toward them, Hugh drives Jay home and flees. 

The next day, the police cannot find the woman or Hugh, who was living under a false identity. At school, Jay sees an old woman in a hospital gown walking towards her, invisible to others. Jay's older sister Kelly and her friends Paul and Yara agree to help and spend the night in the same house. Paul investigates a smashed kitchen window but sees no one; Jay sees a disheveled, urinating, half-naked woman walking toward her. Jay runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity. When a tall man with seemingly no eyes enters the bedroom, Jay flees the house.

With the help of their neighbor, Greg, the group discovers Hugh's real name, Jeff Redmond, and trace him to his address. Jeff explains that the entity began pursuing him after a one-night stand, and that Jay can pass it to someone else in the same way. Greg drives the group to his family's lake house and teaches Jay to shoot a revolver. The entity, taking multiple guises, attacks Jay on the lakefront. She shoots it but it recovers. Jay flees in Greg's car but crashes into a cornfield, and wakes up in a hospital with a broken arm.

Greg has sex with Jay at the hospital, as he does not believe the entity exists. Days later, Jay sees the entity in the form of Greg. It smashes a window at Greg's house and enters. She tries to warn the real Greg on the telephone but he does not answer. She runs into the house and finds the entity in the form of Greg's half-naked mother knocking on his door; it jumps on Greg and kills him. Jay flees by car and spends the night outdoors. On a beach, Jay sees three young men on a boat. She undresses and walks into the water. Back home, Jay refuses Paul's offer of sex.

The group plans to kill the entity by luring it into a swimming pool and dropping electrical devices into the water. Jay, waiting in the pool, spots the entity and realizes it has taken the appearance of her father. It throws the devices at her. Firing at an invisible target, Paul accidentally wounds Yara, but shoots the entity in the head, causing it to fall into the pool. As it pulls Jay underwater, Paul shoots it again and Jay escapes. Paul asks Jay if the entity is dead. Jay approaches the pool and sees it filling with blood.

Jay and Paul have sex. Afterwards, Paul drives past prostitutes in a seedy part of town. Later, Jay and Paul walk down the street holding hands. In the distant background, someone walks behind them.

==Development and production==
Writer and director David Robert Mitchell conceived the film based on recurring dreams he had in his youth about being followed: "I didn't use those images for the film, but the basic idea and the feeling I used. From what I understand, it's an anxiety dream. Whatever I was going through at that time, my parents divorced when I was around that age, so I imagine it was something to do with that."<ref name="ds">{{cite interview|first=Ben|last=Rawson-Jones|date=2015-03-08|accessdate=2015-03-27|interviewer=Mitchell, David Robert|title=Exploring the horror of It Follows: David Robert Mitchell interview|work=Digital Spy}}</ref> The role that [[sexual transmission]] plays came later, from Mitchell's desire for something that could transfer between people.<ref name=Yahoomovies>{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Gwynne|title=The Yahoo Movies Interview: 'It Follows' Director David Robert Mitchell on His Surprise Horror Hit|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/the-yahoo-movies-interview-it-follows-director-114138739632.html|website=Yahoo|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Mitchell started writing the film in 2011 while working on a separate film he intended to be his second feature film; however, Mitchell struggled with this would-be second feature and made ''It Follows'' as his next film instead.<ref name=AVCLUB>{{cite web|last1=Dowd|first1=A.A|title=David Robert Mitchell on his striking new horror film, It Follows|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/david-robert-mitchell-his-striking-new-horror-film-216215|website=The A.V Club|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> Mitchell realized that the concept he was working on was tough to describe and thus refused to discuss the plot when asked what he was working on, reasoning later, "When you say it out loud, it sounds like the worst thing ever."<ref name=Yahoomovies/>

The film was shot in 2013 in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]].<ref name="ac">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-03-26/it-follows-goes-everywhere/|work=Austin Chronicle|title=It Follows Goes Everywhere|author=Whitaker, Richard|date=2015-03-26|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref> Mitchell used [[wide-angle lens]]es when filming to give the film an expansive look,<ref name="ac" /> and cited the works of [[George A. Romero|George Romero]] and [[John Carpenter]] as influences on the film's compositions and visual aesthetic.<ref name="ds"/>

The film's monster, shot composition, and overall aesthetic were influenced by the work of contemporary photographer [[Gregory Crewdson]]. [[Cinematographer|Director of photography]] Mike Gioulakis said: "We're both big fans of the still photographer Gregory Crewdson and David had him in his look book from day one. [Crewdson's] photographs have the same kind of surreal suburban imagery that we wanted for ''It Follows''."<ref>{{Cite web|title = "We Didn’t Have to Add Too Much Creepiness": It Follows DP Mike Gioulakis {{!}} Filmmaker Magazine|url = http://filmmakermagazine.com/93629-we-didnt-have-to-add-too-much-creepiness-it-follows-dp-mike-gioulakis/#.VqhjVlMrLMU|website = Filmmaker Magazine|access-date = 2016-01-27}}</ref>

==Interpretations==
''It Follows'' has sparked numerous interpretations from film critics in regard to the source of "it" and the film's symbolism.<ref name="ds"/> Critics have interpreted the film as a [[parable]] about [[HIV/AIDS]], other [[sexually transmitted infections]],<ref name="guard">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/21/it-follows-teen-horror-movie|title=It Follows: ‘Love and sex are ways we can push death away’|author=Lyne, Charlie|date=2015-02-21|accessdate=2015-03-26|work=The Guardian}}</ref> and the social perceptions thereof; the [[sexual revolution]];<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olszyk|first1=Nicholas|title=Pope Paul VI Make a Horror Film|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/3811/pope_paul_vi_makes_a_horror_movie.aspx|website=Catholic World Report|publisher=Ignatius Press|accessdate=2015-04-14}}</ref> and "primal anxieties" about intimacy.<ref>{{cite web|title=It Follows review – sexual dread fuels a modern horror classic|work=The Guardian|author=Bradshaw, Peter|date=2015-02-26|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/it-follows-review-horror-sex-death}}</ref>

Mitchell stated: "I'm not personally that interested in where 'it' comes from. To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it."<ref name="ds" /> Mitchell said that while Jay "opens herself up to danger through sex, sex is the one way in which she can free herself from that danger ... We're all here for a limited amount of time, and we can't escape our mortality ... but love and sex are two ways in which we can – at least temporarily – push death away".<ref name="guard"/>
