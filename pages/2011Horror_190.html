==Plot==
<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot.  It recommends plot summaries be between 400 and 700 words, and this one is 676 words long. -->
Eric Harson and his girlfriend Talia finish having sex. After taking a shower, Eric finds Talia's corpse and "You're Next" written in her blood. Eric is then attacked and killed by Lamb Mask with a machete.
Later, a woman named Erin accompanies her boyfriend, Crispian Davison to his family reunion at their rural [[Missouri]] vacation home. Present are Crispian's parents Aubrey and Paul, Drake (Crispian's older brother) and Kelly (Drake's wife), younger Davison siblings Felix and Aimee, Zee (Felix's girlfriend) and Tariq (Aimee's boyfriend).

During a dinner argument, crossbow bolts are shot through the window, hitting and killing Tariq and wounding Drake. With their cell phone signals jammed by the attackers, Aimee runs out the front door to get help, but runs into a [[Garrote|garrote wire]] which slices her throat. She quickly dies from blood loss. Crispian leaves the house to find help. Paul brings Aubrey to her bedroom upstairs; when Paul leaves, Fox Mask appears from under the bed with the machete and kills Aubrey. The rest of the family rushes upstairs to find Aubrey dead with the words "You're next" scrawled on the wall in blood and the machete stuck in her face.

Erin texts 911 and begins finding objects that can be used as weapons. She encounters Tiger Mask and evades his attack, wounding him in the process. Kelly returns to the bedroom and discovers Fox Mask still hiding under the bed; she panics and runs to the neighboring home. After pounding on the window for help, she gets inside but discovers the murdered couple who were killed at the beginning of the film, and is killed by Lamb Mask. Back at the house, Tiger Mask fails to kill Erin and is in turn killed by her with a meat tenderizer. Lamb Mask finds Drake, but Erin stabs him with a screwdriver and he retreats.

While exploring the house, Paul finds evidence that the killers had been staying in the house for some time. He tries to tell Zee and Felix, but Fox Mask slits his throat, killing him. It is revealed that Felix and Zee hired the assassins to murder the family and collect their inheritance. Felix is an aggressive killer and he hates his family who are so abusive to him. So with the help of Zee, another aggressive killer, the two hire three killers, Tom (Fox Mask), Craig (Lamb Mask), and Dave (Tiger Mask) to destroy the family. The assassins agree. Meanwhile, Erin (still unaware of Felix and Zee's scheme) and Zee set up traps together; Erin explains that she grew up on a [[Survivalism|survivalist]] compound where she learned her combat and survival skills. Zee is about to attempt to kill Erin, but is interrupted. Felix lures Drake to the basement and fatally stabs him with several screwdrivers.

Erin overhears an argument between Felix, Zee, Fox Mask and Lamb Mask. Realizing their plans, she escapes from the house, injuring her leg in the process. Erin doubles back to the house and kills Lamb Mask by stabbing him in the head with a screwdriver. Realizing she cannot outrun the remaining killer with a wounded leg, Erin sets up a trap at the front door. Fox Mask, however, enters the house through a window, so she sets up an ambush in the basement and kills him with a log. With their hired assassins dead, Zee and Felix attempt to kill Erin themselves, but she brutally kills them both, sticking a live blender onto Felix's head and stabbing Zee through the head. Crispian calls Felix's phone, and when Erin picks up the call, he inadvertently reveals his involvement in the scheme. Crispian returns to the house and, ignoring his attempts to bribe her with money, Erin fatally stabs him in the neck and eye.

A policeman arrives and shoots Erin in the shoulder, having seen her kill Crispian. After calling for backup, he attempts to enter the house but is accidentally killed by Erin's front door trap that was intended for Fox Mask.

==Production==
Barrett wrote the film after Wingard told him that he wanted to do a home invasion movie, noting that they were the only films that still truly frightened him.<ref name="Indiewireprod">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Interview: 'You're Next' Writer Simon Barrett & Director Adam Wingard On Sequel Ideas, Inspiration & The 'V/H/S' Franchise|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/interview-youre-next-writer-simon-barrett-and-director-adam-wingard-on-the-movies-long-journey-to-theaters-potential-sequels-inspiration-and-the-v-h-s-franchise-20130822|website=Indiewire|accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref> From there, Barrett wrote a script inspired by [[Agatha Christie]] mysteries as well as a combination of [[screwball comedies]] and chamber mysteries.<ref name="Indiewireprod"/> Barrett would later note that ''[[Bay of Blood]]'' was probably in the back of his mind when writing the film, although he only realized this after the fact.<ref name="Indiewireprod"/> Wingard credited the film's humor to Barrett's sense of humor and cynicism.  Some of the dinner conversations were improvised and based on real-life experiences the filmmakers had with family members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2013/08/17/youre-next-adam-wingard-ti-west/|title='You're Next': Mumblegore goes mainstream|last=Collis|first=Clark|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=August 17, 2013|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

The film was shot in 2011 at a mansion in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. The filming process took place over four weeks, and shooting consisted mostly of night shoots filmed from 7pm to 7am.<ref name="midmotoday">{{cite web|url=http://www.midmotoday.com/columbia-mansion-featured-in-lionsgate-horror-youre-next/#|title=Columbia Mansion Featured in Horror Film &#039;You&#039;re Next&#039;|publisher=midmotoday.com|accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>
