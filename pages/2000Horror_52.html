==Plot==
{{expand section|date=June 2015}}
A small group of fervent Roman Catholics believe [[Satan]] intends to become man just as [[God]] did in the person of [[Jesus]]. Writings from a seemingly-possessed psychiatric patient lead them to Peter Kelson ([[Ben Chaplin|Chaplin]]). The group suspect it is Kelson's body Satan has chosen to occupy. The youngest of the group, Maya Larkin ([[Winona Ryder|Ryder]]), meets Peter to investigate further and try to convince him of embodied evil. Other signs come to Kelson as he and Maya take a journey full of strange occurrences, self-discovery and an ultimate showdown.

==Production==
The film was shot in 1998 on location in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]] in America. The film was initially set for release in October 1999. However, due to a flood of "end of the world" and supernatural horror movies such as ''[[End of Days (film)|End of Days]]'' and ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' scheduled for release around the same time, a decision was made to delay the film. The second release date, February 2000, was also cancelled due to a conflict with the very popular ''[[Scream 3|Scream]]'' franchise. A final release date of October 2000 was finally decided upon, which also happened to be exactly the same day as the re-release of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.

==Reception==
The film opened at #3 at the North American box office making [[United States dollar|USD]]$7,954,766 in its opening weekend. ''Lost Souls'' ultimately grossed only $31.3 million worldwide, making it a [[Box office bomb]].

The film was given very negative reviews from critics, though the condemnation was somewhat tempered by praise for its photography and atmosphere. It currently holds a 7% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 90 reviews with the consensus stating: "Though Kaminski's film is visually stylish, ''Lost Souls'' is just another derivative entry in the Apocalypse genre, with lackluster direction, unengaging characters, and no scares." It is ranked at number 95 on their 100 worst-reviewed movies of the 2000s.

Elvis Mitchell in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: "There are some particularly fine visual details; it's the central story that's lacking ... After what is supposed to be a harrowing moment, Kelson says, 'I was surprised but I was never frightened.' That about sums up ''Lost Souls.''"<ref>{{cite news | title = Lost Souls | first = Elvis | last = Mitchell | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D04EEDC143FF930A25753C1A9669C8B63 | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2000-10-13 | accessdate = 2010-06-20 }}</ref>  Jonathan Rosenbaum in ''The Chicago Reader'' dismissed the film as "visually striking set pieces set loose in a void.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/lost-souls/Film?oid=1062421|title=Lost Souls|first=Jonathan|last=Rosenbaum|website=Chicago Reader}}</ref>  Steven Rea wrote in ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', "Despite its spooky, color-desaturated visuals, guffaws, not screams, are more in order.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2000-10-13/entertainment/25586906_1_janusz-kaminski-father-lareaux-exorcisms|title=Archives - Philly.com|website=articles.philly.com}}</ref> Carla Meyer wrote in the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', "Even a badly executed horror movie can achieve cheesy greatness. This one, unfortunately, is too somber for that. It's artfully shot -- to be expected with Kaminski as director -- with everything bathed in green and golden light. The set designers should be commended for their fine choice in lamps -- from Tiffany to Deco, they're fabulous, even in the priests' quarters. But when the furniture stands out more than the story, the movie's a stinker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-CLIPS-Opening-today-3238775.php#souls|title=FILM CLIPS / Opening today|publisher=}}</ref>  [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in his review, "''Lost Souls'' possesses the art and craft of a good movie, but not the story. For a thriller about demonic possession and the birth of the antichrist, it's curiously flat.  All through the movie, I found myself thinking about how well it was photographed. Not a good sign."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lost-souls-2000|title=Lost Souls Movie Review & Film Summary (2000) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}</ref>

The critical review from ''[[Film4]]'' wrote: "Concluding with an ending reminiscent of both ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'' and ''[[Jacob's Ladder (film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'' (though delivered with the panache of neither), ''Lost Souls'' is not worth seeking out."<ref>{{cite news | title = LOST SOULS | url = http://www.film4.com/reviews/2000/lost-souls | work = [[Film4]] | date = 2000-10-13 | accessdate = 2010-06-20 }}</ref>
