'''''Biohazard 4D-Executer''''' is a Japanese [[3D animated]] [[biopunk]] [[horror film]] based on the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series of [[survival horror]] video games. It was created by [[Capcom]] in cooperation with Visual Science Laboratory, and distributed by Digital Amuse. ''Biohazard 4D-Executer'' was directed by Koichi Ohata, and written by Daisuke Okamoto, who was supervised by the game series developers. A limited release, the 20-minute film has been an attraction in Japanese theme parks since November 2000, and can be seen in movie theaters and smaller booths. The story centers on the mission of a military squad sent to the zombie-infested [[Raccoon City]] to locate the whereabouts of Dr. Cameron, a female scientist conducting research on a new type of virus.

==Plot==
The film is set in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern American]] Raccoon City, whose citizens have been transformed into zombies after becoming infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company [[List of Resident Evil characters#Umbrella Corporation|Umbrella]]. A military squad – consisting of leader Claus (Masaki Aizawa) and his men Roger ([[Hiroto Torihata]]), Ed (Hideto Ebihara), Robert (Tadasuke Omizu) and Norman (Yoshiyuki Kaneko) – is sent into the city by the company. Members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service, a group specialized in containing biohazard outbreaks caused by Umbrella,<ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]] |developer=[[Capcom Co., Ltd]] |publisher=[[Capcom Entertainment, Inc.]] |date=November 11, 1999 |quote='''Mercenary's diary:''' It looks like my UBCS unit's been called into action.

The squad tracks a signal from her ID card, and is drawn to a warehouse, where Robert is killed during a surprise attack from an unidentified monster. The team blows the creature to pieces, but is unaware of its ability to transfer its mind to other life forms. The squad leaves to chase Dr. Cameron's now-moving signal to a manhole, and the monster follows them in the body of a crow. Norman and Roger accompany Claus into the sewers, while Ed stands guard on the street. Underground, the team finds Dr. Cameron's equipment, and is attacked by a dog. After shooting the dog, they see the doctor's ID card attached to it. Roger, who is a higher-up within Umbrella, reveals to the others that the true purpose of their mission was not to rescue Dr. Cameron, but to collect her research data regarding a new virus capable of regenerating genes. She was infected with her creation, and mutated into the monster that the squad had fought at the warehouse.

While Claus, Norman and Roger return to the surface, Ed is killed by the crow, and transforms into a creature similar to the one in the warehouse. This new monster kills Norman, but Claus and Roger can barely escape in a humvee, using a machine gun attached to the vehicle to destroy it. As the two men drive out of the city, Claus asks about the virus. Roger explains how it fuses with genes, enabling Dr. Cameron to regenerate her body in other life forms, and thus making her nearly immortal. Roger then impales Claus with tentacles, pinning him to the seat. At this point, Roger is revealed to have two faces, the second one being Dr. Cameron's. The researcher explains that she was watching them in the body of the dog while they were in the warehouse, and that she realized that Umbrella was pursuing her research data. Dr. Cameron tells Claus that he and his team turned out to be perfect guinea pigs for the virus she had created, and that she will continue her experiments, trying to return herself to a human form. Using tentacles, she rips Claus' face apart.
