=== Reviews ===
Todd Brown, writing for ''[[Twitch Film]]'', claims to have been, ''drawn in by the simple but compelling story of a young family haunted and possessed,'' with, ''a pretty compelling blend of pulp with legitimate tension,'' which ''looks to ride that same split in influences,'' ''of technical proficiency and just plain pulp'' that has long been the mark of Turkish genre films, ''though the technical end looks stronger than most,'' with, ''truly moody and unsettling imagery.'' ''If the film comes close to living up to the trailer this thing is EASILY going to be the best Turkish genre picture of the past five to ten years,'' he concludes.<ref name="twitch01">{{cite web|title=Website and Trailer for Turkish Horror Musallat (Haunted)|first=Todd|last=Brown|url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2007/08/website-and-trailer-for-turkish-horror-musallat-haunted.php|work=twitch|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name="twitch02">{{cite web |title=Full Theatrical Trailer For Turkish Horror Musallat|first=Todd|last=Brown|url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2007/09/full-theatrical-trailer-for-turkish-horror-musallat.php|work=twitch|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref><ref name="twitch03">{{cite web|title=A Stunning New Theatrical Trailer For Turkish Horror Musallat|first=Todd|last=Brown|url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2007/10/a-stunning-new-theatrical-trailer-for-turkish-horror-musallat.php|work=twitch|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref>

Chris Churchill, also writing for ''Twitch Film'', adds that, ''The film also scored Theatrical releases in a few European countries earlier in the year, something quite rare for Turkish genre films in the past, so there could be something that makes Musallat stand out from the recent crop of Turkish Horror films produced.''<ref name="twitch04">{{cite web|title=Turkish Horror 'Musallat' receives English friendly DVD release|first=Chris|last=Churchill|url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2008/06/turkish-horror-musallat-receives-english-friendly-dvd-release.php|work=twitch|accessdate=February 18, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref>
