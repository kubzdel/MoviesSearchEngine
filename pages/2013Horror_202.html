==Synopsis==
13-year-old burn victim Jimmy Morgan ([[Carmen LoPorto]]) isn't happy. When he starts exhibiting strange powers, he begins to use them on all of the people that he believes has looked down upon him or did him wrong. His brother Mark (Richard D. Busser) tries desperately to use his skills as a [[Catholic priest]] to save Jimmy, but is wildly unsuccessful. Not only does Jimmy manage to escape, but he also transforms the town's children into a bloodthirsty army that drags its prey to an abandoned castle. There Jimmy and the children torture their captives in extremely disturbing and horrific ways.
