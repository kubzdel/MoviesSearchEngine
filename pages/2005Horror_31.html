==Plot==
Dr. Peña (Esposito), a [[cryptozoologist]], manages to capture [[El Chupacabra]] on a remote [[Caribbean]] island and smuggles it aboard the cruise ship Regent Queen, commanded by Captain Randolph (Rhys-Davies) with the assistance of his young daughter, and ship fitness instructor, Jenny (Simmons). The Regent Queen has been experiencing a rash of burglaries, and Federal Marshal Lance Thompson (Neal) is brought on board to investigate.

Unfortunately, crew members sneak into the cargo hold on their break; their curiosity getting the better of them, they accidentally unlock the contained holding the creature. It kills them and escapes into the ship. When bodies start turning up, all passengers are ordered back to their cabins. However, an old woman is trying to catch her [[Shih Tzu]]; she follows it into the casino, where she finds, to her horror, El Chupacabra devouring her dog. Seeing the woman a better meal, the beast attacks and eats her.

[[U.S. Navy Seals]] are called in to help stop the creature, but their efforts are hindered by Dr. Peña, who believes the creature's life is more valuable than the lives of those aboard. The Navy Seals are killed off one by one by the beast and Dr. Peña resorts to using Jenny as live bait to recapture El Chupacabra. However, he is foiled when the beast outsmarts and fatally wounds him. Jenny is saved by Lance and they meet up with her father, who has set the engines to explode as all the other passengers have been evacuated. They flee on a lifeboat moments before the ship blows up and sinks the ship, taking the beast with it. As the group watches the ship sink, Captain Randolph tells Jenny and Lance that he has decided to retire and write his memoirs.

Critical reception for the film has been mostly negative, with critics criticizing the film's monster design, and over-reliance on cheap thrills.

[[TV Guide]] panned the film, awarding it 1 out of four stars criticizing the film's reliance on cheap thrills and parodistic laughs stating, "[though] the gore may satisfy die-hard monster mashers, but the cheesy-looking creature isn’t fit to touch the gills of the Creature from the Black Lagoon".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pardi|first1=Robert|title=Chupacabra Terror Review|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/chupacabra-terror/review/286115/|website=TV Guide|publisher=Robert Pardi|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>
