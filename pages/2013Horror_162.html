==Production==
While creating ''Raze'', Waller tried to treat the film "as seriously as if it were men that were abducted and forced to fight each other."<ref name=EW>{{cite web|title='Raze' director Josh Waller talks about his all-female fight movie|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/01/08/raze-zoe-bell-rosario-dawson/|publisher=EW|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> For him this meant avoiding stereotypes typically seen within the "largely exploitative subgenre of women-in-prison" such as nudity, as he felt that viewers would not see this in an all-male exploitation film.<ref name=EW /> Waller also tried to avoid gratuitous gore.<ref name=Fearnet>{{cite web|title=We Talk to 'Raze' Director Josh C. Waller and Actress Zoe Bell|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/we-talk-raze-director-josh-c-waller-and-actress-zoe-bell|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> ''Raze'' was shot with a very tight schedule and the crew had only thirty days to film nineteen action sequences.<ref name=Fearnet /> Partway through filming, [[Rosario Dawson]] was brought onto the set for a cameo as she had previously worked together with Bell and Thoms on the 2007 film ''[[Death Proof]]''.<ref name=EW /> Bell was not made aware of Dawson's casting or arrival, as Waller wanted her appearance to come as a surprise.<ref name=EW />

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Raze'' has been mixed and the film currently holds a rating of 44% on ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', based on 32 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=Raze (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/raze_2013/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> Criticism for the film predominantly centered upon the familiarity of the film's plot,<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: ‘Raze’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-raze-1201038414/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> and ''[[Fearnet]]'' reviewer Scott Weinberg commented that "''<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=Raze (review)|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-raze|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> Raze'' is simply a gender-friendly twist on a very conventional tale, but it's still a rather fun way to spend 85 minutes if you're tired of the same old action." ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the movie's screenplay, as they felt that it did not give actors Jones and Fenn enough to work with and also opined that the movie's "opening title card, which cites statistics about the number of women who go missing in any given year -- the co-opting of real-world suffering making it that much harder to go along with Waller's idea of it's-only-a-midnight-movie kicks."<ref>{{cite web|title=Raze: Tribeca Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/raze-tribeca-review-447296|publisher=THR|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> In contrast ''[[Twitch Film]]'' praised Bell's acting as one of the film's highlights, as they felt that it helped "lift Raze above similarly themed genre film endeavors."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tribeca 2013 Review: RAZE, A Bloody and Brutal Female-Centered Action Spectacle Headlined by Stuntwoman Turned Thespian Zoe Bell|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2013/05/tribeca-2013-review-raze-a-bloody-and-brutal-female-centered-action-spectacle-headlined-by-stuntwoma.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> The ''[[New York Times]]'' opined that the film would not appeal to everyone but that "there is food for thought here about the subjugation and exploitation of women, the limits of psychological and physical endurance, and more."<ref>{{cite web|title=And You Thought Cockfights Were Brutal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/movies/raze-with-zoe-bell-and-rachel-nichols.html?_r=0|publisher=NYT|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>
