'''''Sadik 2''''' is a 2013 French horror film that was directed by Robin Entreinger. The film had its world premiere on 23 August 2013 at the [[London FrightFest Film Festival]] and centers upon a group of friends that finds themselves hunted by a sadistic killer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sadik 2|url=http://www.frightfest.co.uk/films/2013films/2013film4frigh27.html|publisher=Fright Fest|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>

The film's title implies that it is the second film in a series but is actually the first film, as Entreinger thought that it would be interesting to film a "sequel" before creating the first film.<ref name=THC>{{cite web|last1=Whittington|first1=James|title=Interview With Robin Entreinger Director Of Sadik 2|url=http://www.horrorchannel.co.uk/articles.php?feature=8569&category=5|publisher=The Horror Channel|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> ''Sadik 2'' references the fictional first film by having the characters reference it by commenting that ''Sadik'' became popular due to rumors that it was a [[snuff film]], as all of the actors were genuinely murdered on camera.<ref name=SD>{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kim|title=Sadik 2|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/sadik-2/5059523.article|publisher=Screen Daily|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref>

==Production==
While developing the film Entreinger wanted to "play with the basics of horror films".<ref name=SFN>{{cite web|last1=Hatfull|first1=Jonathan|title=SADIK 2 DIRECTOR ON LOW-BUDGET FRENCH HORROR|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/sadik-2-director-robin-entreinger-on-low-budget-french-horror/|publisher=SciFiNow|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> He described it by saying that he "wanted to do a sort of soap TV show that goes into horror afterwards. So you have two stories; the TV show that looks like a TV comedy stuff, and then it goes into horror.<ref name=SFN /> Entreinger and his co-writer Jean-Nicolas Laurent wanted to make a film similar to the ''[[Scream film series|Scream]]'' and ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' franchises and they decided to make the film sequel before making the initial film, which is referenced in the film's title of ''Sadik 2''.<ref name=THC /> It took Entreinger AND Laurent about two to three weeks to complete the script for ''Sadik 2'', which they wrote in Laurent's apartment.<ref name=THC /> Filming took place over a seven-day period and the crew shot on average 10 [[Sequence (filmmaking)|sequences]] a day.<ref name=SFN /> This was made somewhat more difficult as part of the filming had to be shot in a basement that was not part of the house used for another location, necessitating that the crew move between the two locations.<ref name=SFN />

==Reception==
''What Culture'' and ''Grolsch Film Works'' both panned the film,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=FRIGHTFEST 2013: SADIK 2|url=http://grolschfilmworks.com/ca/reviews/frightfest-2013-sadik-2|publisher=Grolsch Film Works|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> and ''What Culture'' wrote "Though wearing its meta tone on its sleeve, ''Sadik 2'' takes far too long to engage with its twisty concept, and is painfully subject to a subterranean budget."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=Shaun|title=FrightFest 2013: You’re Next, Hatchet 3, VHS 2 & More Reviewed|url=http://whatculture.com/film/frightfest-2013-youre-next-hatchet-3-vhs-2-more-reviewed.php/4|publisher=What Culture|accessdate=31 December 2014}}</ref> ''[[Screen Daily]]'' was mixed in their review and they commented that "It is well-acted and written and the first half almost works as character drama, though surprisingly little is made of the victims’ shared history in care.  However, all that goes out the window when the slaughter starts.  The snuff scenes are horrid but filmed with some restraint, evoking the added-on coda of the 1978 exploitation effort ''[[Snuff (film)|Snuff]]'' in the depiction of the killer filmmakers as part of a regular industry, just trying to get the job done, bitching about the chores they have to do because they’re understaffed and falling behind schedule."<ref name=SD />
