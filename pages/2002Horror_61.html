'''''New Alcatraz''''' (named '''''Boa''''' on VHS and DVD), is a 2002 American [[direct-to-video]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film|horror]] film. It was directed by Phillip Roth.

==Plot==
In New Alcatraz, the world's most secure prison located in Northeastern Antarctica, a drilling operation occurs which inadvertently releases a giant boa constrictor from the ice. The snake chews a hole through the ice, and security discovers it days later. However, during an inspection of the hole, the snake is let loose into the prison, killing three workers in the process. The prison sends out a distress call which is received by the United States military. They hire paleontologist Robert Trenton, and his wife Jessica to assist a military team in the search. When they arrive at the prison, they discover the only survivors to be head of security Quinn, and prison warden Fred Ryan.

After one troop is killed by the snake, the rest of the team, and Quinn go to search for him. However, a gas explosion occurs that kills the rest of the military team, as well as Quinn. This attracts the snake, which chases Robert, and Jessica, and Jessica is seemingly killed. Robert returns to the security room, and convinces Riley to release the prisoners for help. Riley then releases the prisoners, and the group devises a plan to escape. During the escape, one of the prisoners, Kely Mitich, attempts to save himself, only to be killed by the snake that accidentally causes another gas explosion which kills Riley. Meanwhile, the other group led by prisoner Yuri Breshcov finds Jessica alive, and they take her in. The snake then kills two of the prisoners, and Yuri, and Jessica escape to the surface. Meanwhile, Robert, and prisoner Patricia O'Boyle attempt to escape, although the snake kills Patricia while Robert escapes to the surface. Robert, Jessica, and Yuri attempt to escape on the military plane, although the snake sneaks onto the plane, and kills one of the pilots. In the ensuing battle, Yuri is sucked out of the plane, and falls to his death, as does the snake. Robert, and Jessica, bewildered, ask the remaining pilot if he can still fly, to which he responds to by asking if the snake is still in the back of the plane.

==Critical reception==
''Boa'' was released to compete with ''[[Python II]]'' (2002), a sequel to one of the most popular made-for-television snake movies of all time, ''[[Python (film)|Python]]''. ''Boa'' was a critical failure, with reviews citing bad acting and poor special effects.

==Sequel==
''[[Boa vs. Python]]'' was released after the success of the [[Python (film)|''Python'' franchise]] and the failure of ''Boa''; ''Boa v. Python'' was also a critical failure. The filmmakers had decided to make a crossover with ''Python'' and ''Boa'', involving the two types of snakes fighting each other. It has been noted that ''Boa vs. Python'' was inspired by ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004).

==Release==
Both the [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] versions have been out of print as of 2010, but they can be found online and at [[Netflix]].
