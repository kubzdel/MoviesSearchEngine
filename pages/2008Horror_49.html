==Production==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
===Budget===
The full budget of ''Dark Floors'' reached $4.3 million (U.S.), making it one of the most expensive films made in Finland.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Most of the budget was spent on special effects design, set construction, and a large marketing campaign, along with the post-production process.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Scenery and Special Effects===
The sets were the largest constructed in Finland, taking up 1700 square metres during the basement carpark scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} It had been originally planned to shoot the film on location in the Baltics, but [[Oulu]] was chosen instead, with special effects used to replicate a city when necessary.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The production team visited hospitals to research the workings of an X-ray, thereby adding both credibility and authenticity to the CGI-rendered X-rays shown.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} When principal photography was completed, the extended post-production phase was launched, including the insertion of Awa's ghostly appearance.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Release==

===Marketing===
The film was originally intended to premiere in 2007, at the Eurovision song contest in Helsinki, whose opening number, featuring Lordi, with a performance of 'Hard Rock Hallelujah'.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Unfortunately, the team could not finish their tasks in time; moreover, Lordi were already putting final touches on their Bringing Back the Balls to Europe tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Post-production was therefore expanded into May of the same year, and was eventually rescheduled to December.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The press conference was held at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] the weekend of the 19th and 20 May 2007.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Lordi appeared personally, as did director Pete Riski, producer Markus Selin, and virtually all the leading actors.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} All involved responded to questions, and shared unusual anecdotes on making the film.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''Dark Floors'' was slowly 'leaked' by way of a marketing campaign, and the press were permitted to witness the production of Kita's lift scene, although everything else was kept under wraps.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}
