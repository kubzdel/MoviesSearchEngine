'''''The Devil Inside''''' is a 2012 American [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[William Brent Bell]], and written by Bell and [[Matthew Peterman]]. It is a documentary-style film about a woman who becomes involved in a series of [[exorcism in Christianity|exorcism]]s during her quest to determine what happened to her mother, a woman who murdered three people as a result of being [[Demonic possession|possessed by a demon]]. Produced by Peterman and Morris Paulson,<ref name="HR"/> the film stars [[Fernanda Andrade]], [[Simon Quarterman]], [[Evan Helmuth]], and [[Suzan Crowley]], and was released theatrically on January 6.

The film topped the US box office on its opening weekend, yet dropped drastically in the second week, before disappearing completely from the box office top ten.<ref name="Slate ending article">{{cite web|last=Haglund|first=David|title=Does The Devil Inside Have the Worst Ending in Movie History?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/01/09/the_devil_inside_ending_is_it_the_worst_ever_and_why_do_people_hate_it_.html|website=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref>  Despite critical disdain, it was a commercial success and grossed roughly $101 million.

== Plot ==

On October 30, 1989, Maria Rossi ([[Suzan Crowley]]) committed a triple murder during an [[exorcism]] performed on her. The [[Catholic Church]] became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Rome]]. A news story and police investigation show the three members of the clergy whom she murdered. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her.

Twenty years later, Isabella ([[Fernanda Andrade]]) is in the process of filming a documentary about exorcisms and, to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome. She meets two priests, Ben ([[Simon Quarterman]]) and David ([[Evan Helmuth]]), who take her with them on an exorcism performed on Rosalita ([[Bonnie Morgan]]). They bring along medical equipment to determine if it's possession or mental illness. Rosalita attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. She calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her. Eventually, they get her under control.

When Isabella goes to visit her mother, Maria, in the asylum, she finds that her mother speaks in different accents and has paintings all over the walls. Maria then soils herself while screaming a weird language. She has inverted crosses carved into her arms and her bottom lip. Maria tells Isabella that killing a child is against God's will. Isabella tells David and Ben that she had an abortion years ago and her mother had no way of knowing that—another sign that showed possible possession. As the crew prepares to perform an exorcism/analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past.

After analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben plays the audio files over and over. Ben finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison. David is to perform a [[baptism]] at his church, in which Michael tags along to record. When he holds the baby to start the [[immersion baptism]], he mutters some lines from the [[Bible]] and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water. The crowd rush up to save the baby as he passes out.

Soon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and David acquires an officer's handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]], and forgets the last few words. He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.

Ben hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She then tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, and acceleration can be heard as Michael speeds into oncoming traffic. The camera goes black, and cuts in with short sequences of chaos, most likely of Michael, Isabella and Ben flying through their car windshield. 

Before the credits start rolling, a title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website "for more information on the ongoing investigation".

== Production ==

The genesis of the film happened in 2005, as writer Matthew Peterman read about the Vatican's school of exorcism and approached director [[William Brent Bell]] on exploiting that. The duo wrote a traditional script  however they eventually, according to Peterman "got frustrated with that process" so they rewrote to a [[mockumentary]] style following a suggestion from producer Morris Paulson.<ref name=bd>[http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/27810/interview-the-devil-inside-filmmakers-speak-on-low-budget-horror-bold-finales/ (Interview) 'The Devil Inside' Filmmakers Speak On Low Budget Horror & Bold Finales!]</ref>

Principal photography began in 2010 in several locations, including Bucharest (Romania), Rome (Italy) and Vatican City. The film is of the "[[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]" genre, and so is shot in documentary style despite being fictional. [[Lorenzo di Bonaventura]] and Steven Schneider took the movie to [[Paramount Pictures]],<ref name="HR"/><ref name="V">{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118035756 | title=Big players eye more low-budget fare | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=April 23, 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-29 | author=Goldstein, Gregg}}</ref> who ultimately produced it through their low-budget company [[Insurge Pictures]], who acquired the film as their first release hoping it would replicate the success of ''[[Paranormal Activity (film)|Paranormal Activity]]''.<ref name="HR">{{cite news | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/heat-vision/paramount-bets-devil-paranormal-activity-96393 | title=Paramount Bets 'The Devil Inside' Is Its Next 'Paranormal Activity' | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 3, 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-29 | author=Kit, Borys}}</ref>

== Reception ==

The film was not screened for critics, and was subsequently almost universally panned. It received an F from [[CinemaScore]], which tracks audience reaction. Despite that, it topped the box office its opening weekend, [[dump months|the first after]] the [[New Year's Day]] holiday, displacing ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', which had held that position for three straight weeks.<ref name="Slate ending article" /> At the time, it was the third-best January opening weekend after ''[[Cloverfield]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' special edition.<ref name="Box Office Mojo January opening weekends table">{{cite web|title=Top Opening Weekends by Month—January|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=01&p=.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|year=2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> In its second weekend, however, the film dropped 76.2%, which was the largest second weekend drop for a film since ''[[Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience]]'' (77.4%) in early 2009.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3348&p=.htm Weekend Report: 'Contraband' Hijacks MLK Weekend].

Based on 80 reviews by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film currently holds an approval rating of 6%.  The consensus is: "''The Devil Inside'' is a cheap, choppy unscary mess, featuring one of the worst endings in recent memory."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_devil_inside/ | title=The Devil Inside | work=Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' wrote that the film was a candidate for the worst film of 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.toronto.com/article/709178--the-devil-inside-the-devil-didn-t-do-it| title=The Devil Inside: The Devil didn't do it. | work=Toronto.com | accessdate=January 6, 2012 | date=January 5, 2012 | last=Howell|first=Peter}}</ref>  Stephen Whitty of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' wrote that "after ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' got by with sticks and stones and offscreen noises, filmmakers started thinking they didn't have to show anything.

The film's ending, in particular, came under heavy criticism. "Is it the worst movie ending of all time?" David Haglund asked in ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]'', citing various negative audience reaction to that aspect of the film online. "What upset them even more than its abruptness", he suggested, "was the title immediately following it that urged audiences to visit a website to learn more. "[It's] a marketing twist that makes audiences feel taken advantage of," said Haglund.<ref name="Slate ending article" /> The writers defended themselves by saying that they knew the unconventional closure would draw criticism, but "felt authentic to us" as according to co-writer Matthew Peterman “Sometimes real life doesn’t follow a perfect structure. Things aren’t always wrapped up and resolved when or how you’d like them to be. All of us enjoyed leaving things open ended. We thought it was visceral, we thought it was unique.”<ref>[http://screenrant.com/the-devil-inside-ending-spoilers-discussion-rothc-147380/ ‘The Devil Inside’ Director Defends the Movie’s Ending]</ref> Director William Brent Bell added that the title card directing to a website was added by Paramount, given "thought it was kind of cool to continue the story on this website".<ref name=bd/>

Besides the preponderance of negative reviews, there were a few critics who gave the film a positive review.  Steve "Uncle Creepy" Barton of Dread Central stated, "''The Devil Inside'' is home to moments that will shock, scare, disturb, and leave you gasping. It's a trip to the dark side that's well worth taking."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/devil-inside-2012 | title=The Devil Inside (2012)|last=Barton|first=Steve | work=[[Dread Central]] |  accessdate=January 6, 2012}}</ref> Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "generates a fair amount of suspense during sizable swaths of its familiar but serviceable exorcism-centric scenario."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946809?refcatid=31 | title=Variety reviews ''The Devil Inside'' | work=Variety | date=January 6, 2012 | accessdate=January 6, 2012 | last=Leydon|first=Joe}}</ref>

== Legacy ==

The film's commercial success despite negative critical and audience reaction made it one of several that led studios to reconsider their longtime practice of confining horror films to the [[dump months]] and [[Halloween]] season. "For years, horror movies made $19–20 million in a January release. They would take the weekend and that would be it," [[C. Robert Cargill]] of [[Ain't It Cool News]] told [[Hollywood.com]]. "But ''The Devil Inside'' proved that even in our worst dumping ground, you can appeal to a market that won't see movies, and in fact they'll throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good. I mean, $35 million is sick money for an opening weekend for a film that cost, what, $250,000?"<ref name="Hollywood.com January article">{{cite web|last=Salisbury|first=Brian|title=Why Oscar Season is Hollywood's Bad Movie Dumping Ground|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/55002083/bad-january-february-movies-oscar-season|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|date=February 23, 2013|accessdate=December 20, 2013}}</ref>
