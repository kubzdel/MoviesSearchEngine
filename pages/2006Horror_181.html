'''''Slaughtered Vomit Dolls''''' is a 2006 Canadian-American [[horror film]] written and directed by Lucifer Valentine, who coined "vomit gore" as a new subgenre.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vomit Gore!|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/vomit-gore|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> The film had a simultaneous DVD and limited theatrical release on February 14, 2006. The film follows a very loose plot structure, consisting of assorted random scenes mostly revolving around Angela Aberdeen, a bulimic stripper-turned-prostitute.

''Slaughtered Vomit Dolls'' is part of the ''Vomit Gore Trilogy'' and was followed by two sequels: ''[[ReGOREgitated Sacrifice]]'' (2008) and ''[[Slow Torture Puke Chamber]]'' (2010).  A fourth "Vomit Gore" film - titled ''[[Vomit Gore 4: Black Mass of the Nazi Sex Wizard]]'' - was released in 2015.

==Reception==
''[[JoBlo.com]]'' panned ''Slaughtered Vomit Dolls'' overall, saying that while they were curious to see what the director could do next, the film "ultimately fails to either entertain, shock, or put forth any novel ideas."<ref>{{cite web|title=SLAUGHTERED VOMIT DOLLS (Review)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/slaughtered-vomit-dolls|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> ''[[HorrorNews.net]]'' also gave a negative review, criticizing the film and stating that "If you need a movie to have some form of a linear story, don’t bother with this one. If you are tired of seeing women constantly berated and insulted and shown as weak and scared, don’t bother with this one. And if vomit isn’t your thing, yeah, definitely don’t bother with this one."<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: Slaughtered Vomit Dolls (2006)|url=http://horrornews.net/76811/film-review-slaughtered-vomit-dolls-2006/|publisher=HN.n|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> ''[[DVD Talk]]'' reviewed the trilogy as a whole and gave it a mostly positive review, saying that the films would not appeal to every viewer and that "for horror fans who want something different, something that mixes up art and sex and violence and gore and surrealism and who don't mind the confrontational nature of Valentine's work, this set is worth seeking out."<ref>{{cite web|title=Vomit Gore Trilogy (review)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45379/vomit-gore-trilogy/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>
