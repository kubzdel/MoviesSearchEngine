==Reception==
Andy Webb from "The Movie Scene" gave the film three out of five stars, stating: "What this all boils down to is that "The Rats" is some old fashioned horror fun which plays on people's own fears of rats. Of course if you think rats are cute and adorable then this isn't going to work and you might even be offended at the portrayal of rats or the ridiculous climax. But if you do have a fear of the fury [sic] rodents this movie is not one to watch before you go to sleep."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Andy|title=Alright Rat Fans|url=http://www.themoviescene.co.uk/reviews/the-rats-2002/the-rats-2002.html|website=The Movie Scene|accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> Rod Lott from "Flick Attack", wrote: "Come up with a cliché, and sooner or later, The Rats gets to it, right down to the ever-predictable it-ain’t-really-over final shot. Child’s Play 2 and Man’s Best Friend director John Lafia does a decent job, having experience with all sorts of beasts, like killer dolls, robot dogs and Ally Sheedy."<ref name="Flick Attack">{{cite web|last1=Lott|first1=Rod|title=The Rats (2002)|url=http://www.flickattack.com/2012/11/the-rats-2002/|website=Flick Attack|accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref> Florita A. from "Hell Horror", scored the film 4 out of 10, writing: "The Rats was made simple, and that was not an ideal thing as the movie flopped although it was a TV movie. I like the idea of rats playing on someone’s fear, but it came down to the film not being executed in the right manner to send frights across to its audience amongst other things."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rats (2002)|url=https://hellhorror.com/movies/review/5154/The-Rats.html|website=Hell Horror|accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref>
