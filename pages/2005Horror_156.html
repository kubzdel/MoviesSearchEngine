'''''Saw II''''' is a 2005 American [[horror film]], a [[sequel]] to 2004's ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' and the second installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], directed and co-written by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]] and series creator [[Leigh Whannell]]. The film stars [[Donnie Wahlberg]], [[Franky G]], [[Glenn Plummer]], [[Beverley Mitchell]], [[Dina Meyer]], [[Emmanuelle Vaugier]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Shawnee Smith]], and [[Tobin Bell]].

The film features [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw]] being apprehended by the police, but trapping the arresting officer in one of his own games while showing another game of eight people — including the officer's son — in progress on TV monitors at another location. It also explores some of John Kramer's [[backstory]], providing a partial explanation of his reason for becoming Jigsaw.

After the financial success of ''Saw'', a sequel was immediately green-lit. [[Leigh Whannell]] and [[James Wan]] were busy preparing for their next film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called ''The Desperate'' before ''Saw'' was released and was looking for a producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]]. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into ''Saw II''. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.

''Saw II'' was released on October 28, 2005 and, despite mixed reviews from critics, was a financial success, with opening takings of $31.9 million and grossing $88 million in the United States and Canada. It has remained the highest grossing ''Saw'' film in those countries. Bell was nominated for "Best Villain" at the [[2006 MTV Movie Awards]] for his role as Jigsaw in the film. ''Saw II'' was released to [[DVD]] on February 14, 2006 and topped charts its first week, selling more than 3 million units. At the time, it was the fastest-selling theatrical DVD in Lionsgate's history.

==Plot==
Informant Michael Marks awakens in a room with a spike-filled mask locked around his neck. A videotape informs him that in order to unlock the device, he must cut into his eye to obtain the key. He sets off the timer and finds the scalpel, but cannot bring himself to retrieve the key and is killed after sixty seconds when the mask closes.

At the scene of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, [[Detective Eric Matthews|Eric Matthews]], and calls him in. Despite not wanting to be involved in the case, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a [[SWAT]] team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw Killer]], who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; including his only known survivor [[Amanda Young]], and Eric's estranged son Daniel. The other victims are called Xavier, Gus, Jonas, Laura, Addison and Obi. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them all within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that if he follows the rules of his own game, by simply talking with John, he will see Daniel again. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.

The victims are informed by a micro-cassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; one is in the room's safe, and they have the combination with the "numbers in the back of their mind." Xavier ignores a warning note and uses the key provided with the cassette on the door, which fires a bullet through the peephole as Gus looks through it, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the door opens, but with no success. After discovering a door, the group travel to the basement where Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside. But inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes as well. In another room, Xavier's test is to go into a pit full of needles and retrieve the key to the antidote. However, he throws Amanda into the pit instead and though she is able to retrieve the key, they run out of time to unlock the door containing the antidote and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, the victims discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; with the sole exception of Daniel.

Meanwhile, John passes the time with both idle and cryptic chat, eventually telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. With the little time he has left, he wants to inspire in others the new appreciation for life he had found. Not interested in any of this, Eric runs out of patience and returns to the monitors. He destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals the connection between the victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes, and Daniel will be in danger if his identity is discovered.

Having left the others, Xavier returns to the safe room and finds a colored number on the back of Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent and dies, but not before finding the clue revealing Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box containing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to the bathroom from [[Saw (2004 film)|the first film]]. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he cannot read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a [[hacksaw]], killing him.

Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John and forces him to lead him to the house. John's sitting area is revealed to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place ''before'' they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an [[oxygen mask]]. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda appears in the doorway, says "game over" and seals the door, as Eric screams and is left to die.

Music video director [[Darren Lynn Bousman]] had just completed a script for his first film ''The Desperate'', and was trying to sell it to studios but was getting reactions that the script was very similar to ''Saw''. A German studio eventually approached him with an offer to produce the film for $1 million. Just as they were looking for a cinematographer, the American cinematographer David A.

In order for this to be done safely, four people, over a period of four days, removed the needle tips from syringes and replaced them with fiber optic tips. They modified a total of 120,000 fake needles. However, this number was insufficient and the pit had to be filled with styrofoam and other materials to make it appear to have more needles. The needles that were apparently stuck into Smith were actually blunted syringes stuck into padding under her clothing. For certain shots, a fake arm was used.<ref>{{cite video |people=[[David Hackl]] (production designer), Jim Murray (property master), Darren Lynn Bousman (writer/director) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Needle Pit |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]] |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Darren Lynn Bousman CC.JPG|thumb|right|''Saw II'' was Bousman's first feature film.]]
Bousman came up with an idea whereby a character's hands would get stuck in some sort of vessel and this resulted in the "Hand Trap". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, [[property master]] Jim Murray and [[art director]] Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her hands into the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her hands into the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |title=How to Engineer a Nightmare |last=Shapiro |first=Jessica |journal=[[Machine Design]] |volume=80 |issue=20 |pages=22–23 |date=October 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62GdveX3S?url=http://machinedesign.com/article/how-to-engineer-a-nightmare-1023 |archivedate=October  7, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Hand Trap |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

The original idea for the "Furnace Trap" came from the house having been a [[Crematory|crematorium]] at some point, but this would have involved turning the house into a funeral parlor, so it was instead decided that the furnace would be part of the house's boiler system. The furnace was visualized in the form of a computer model so that Bousman could better understand how shots could be filmed. Using the computer model as a guide, the furnace was constructed in three days using [[cement board]] and [[tin]] with removable sides and top so Timothy Burd (Obi) could be filmed crawling inside. The furnace produced real flames and, in place of Burd, a stunt man using a [[fire-retardant gel]] crawled into the fire.<ref>{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Furnace |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}</ref>

===Critical response===
The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised the acting, particularly the performances of Bell and Wahlberg, while criticizing the gruesome nature of the story. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 37% of 119 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 4.6 out of 10. The site's consensus was, "''Saw II'' is likely to please the gore-happy fans of the original, though it may be too gruesome for those not familiar with first film's premise".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw_ii/| title=Saw II (2005)| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] | accessdate = August 22, 2011}}</ref> Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 40 based on 28 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/saw-ii/critic-reviews| title= Saw II Reviews | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate =  August 22, 2011}}</ref>

Robert Koehler of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying "cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isn't enough to get ''Saw II'' out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928622?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Saw II Review |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |accessdate=October 20, 2005 |first=Robert |last=Koehler |date=October 20, 2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617fegEfp?url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117928622/ |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Gregory Kirschling of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B minus, saying "''Saw II'' is just barely a better [[B movie|B flick]] than ''Saw''" and that both films are "more clever and revolting than they are actually chilling". He praised Bell's performance as Jigsaw, saying "As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh, Tobin Bell is, for all the film's gewgaws, ''Saw II''{{'s}} sturdiest horror, a [[Terence Stamp]] look-alike who calls to mind a seedy [[General Zod]] lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoer's lair".  He ended his review: "Where ''Saw II'' lags behind in Saw's novelty, it takes the lead with its smoother landing, which is again primed to blow the movie wide open, but manages a more compelling job of it than the original's cheat finish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1123047,00.html |title=Movie Review Saw II (2005) |last=Kirschling |first=Gregory |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=October 26, 2005 |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617hi5y12?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1123047,00.html |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>

Kevin Crust of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling ''Saw II'' a "worthy follow-up to its grisly predecessor". He said the story was "much more focused on an endgame than the original film. There are fewer credibility gaps and there are plenty of reversals to satisfy fans". He criticized the use of numerous flashbacks, saying that it "rob[s] us of the pleasure of actually remembering for ourselves".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/28/entertainment/et-saw28 |title=Grisly 'Saw II' makes the cut |last=Crust |first=Kevin |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=October 29, 2005 |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617jXtG4P?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/28/entertainment/et-saw28 |archivedate=August 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Laura Kern, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', gave it a mixed review, saying that Bousman "delivers similar hard-core, practically humorless frights and hair-raising tension, but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics-themed television show than a scary movie" and called Greutert's editing "crafty". She called the sequel "more trick than treat" and that it "doesn't really compare to its fine predecessor - though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2005/10/28/movies/28saw.html |title=Round 2 in a House of Horror |last=Kern |first=Laura |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 28, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714032226/http://movies.nytimes.com/2005/10/28/movies/28saw.html |archivedate=July 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>  ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars. He said that the film improves upon ''Saw''{{'s}} "perverse fascination with ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''-style murders and brutally violent puzzles" and that Jigsaw's intellectual games make "[[Hannibal Lecter]] look like the compiler of ''The Sun''{{'}}s quick crossword". He ended his reviews saying, "Morally dubious it may be, but this gory melange of torture, terror and darkly humorous depravity appeals to the sick puppy within us all".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132340 |title=Saw II Movie Review |last=Newman |first=Kim |authorlink=Kim Newman |work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |date=October 2005 |accessdate=September 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61oExb0Km?url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132340 |archivedate=September 19, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>
