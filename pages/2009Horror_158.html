'''''Pandorum''''' is a German-British 2009 [[science fiction]] [[horror film]], with elements of [[Lovecraftian horror]], and [[Survival film|survival adventure]]. The film was directed by [[Christian Alvart]] and produced by Robert Kulzer, [[Jeremy Bolt]] and [[Paul W.S. Anderson]]. Travis Milloy wrote the screenplay from a story by Milloy and Alvart. It stars [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Ben Foster]]. Filming began in Berlin in August 2008. ''Pandorum'' was released on 25 September 2009 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=41441 |title=Pandorum |work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=Coming Soon Media, L.P |accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref> and on 2 October 2009 in the UK.

The film's title is a nickname of a fictional psychosis called "Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome" (ODS for short) caused by [[outer space|deep space]] and triggered by emotional stress leading to severe [[paranoia]], [[delirium]], and nosebleeding. The film received mixed to negative reviews.

== Plot ==
In 2174, the human population has depleted all the resources on Earth, leading humanity to build a huge [[interstellar ark]] named ''Elysium''. It carries 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to colonize an [[Earth analog|Earth-like planet]] named Tanis. The passengers are placed in [[sleeper ship|hypersleep]], with a rotating crew who take turns awakening from hypersleep every two years to maintain the ship. Eight years into the mission, the ship receives a transmission from Earth in multiple languages: "You're all that's left of us. Good luck, God bless, and godspeed."

Some unknown time later, two members of the flight crew, Corporal Bower and Lieutenant Payton, are awakened. Improper emergence from the hibernatory state leaves them both with partial [[amnesia]]. The ship is experiencing power surges caused by an unstable nuclear reactor, and they are unable to enter the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]].

While Payton stays behind to attempt to access the ship's computer, Bower ventures into the seemingly abandoned ship using the ventilation system with the intention of stabilising the reactor. He begins to suffer from "Orbital Dysfunction Syndrome," a severe psychotic illness known to affect deep-space travelers, commonly called "Pandorum." Pandorum led to the failure of a previous mission, as the captain of the starship called ''Eden'' became so afflicted with Pandorum that he became convinced that the flight was cursed and ejected all 5,000 passengers into deep space to their deaths.

Bower encounters Nadia, a geneticist, and Manh, an agriculturist, and they are attacked by a group of fast and vicious cannibalistic humanoids with a seemingly tribal culture. The trio flees into a barricaded chamber and finds a [[cook (profession)|cook]] named Leland, who has been awake for years, living off the water leaking into the ship, the algae it creates, and resorting to cannibalism. Meanwhile, Payton finds a young man named Corporal Gallo, who claims that the ship is lost in space. He claimed that he killed his team in self-defense because they developed Pandorum after finding out that Earth mysteriously vanished.

Leland gives food to Bower's group and shows them mural drawings depicting their true origin. According to the drawings, after Earth vanished following an unknown catastrophe, Gallo went insane. After killing his team, he begins to "play God" by awakening passengers and abusing them. Taking advantage of their mental state, Gallo then convinced these passengers, many of whom are affected by Pandorum, to exile themselves to the ship's enormous cargo hold and survive by fighting, torturing and eating each other. Eventually, Gallo went back into hypersleep, leaving the descendants of the psychotics to evolve. After multiple generations, accelerated by an [[enzyme]] produced in the hypersleep pod's feeding tubes, the passengers' descendants adapted to their living condition and became a [[troglofauna]] species, with Gallo's savage game becoming the centre of their culture.

After eating Leland's drug-laden food, the group falls asleep. When they wake up, Leland is preparing to kill and butcher them. Bower convinces him to let them fix the ship's reactor, otherwise the ship will be destroyed, killing them all. Noticing the ship's power has been unstable recently, Leland agrees to free the group. Bower hopes to find his wife on the ship before the creatures do, but later his memories come back to him and he remembers that she divorced him and stayed on Earth, disappearing along with the rest of the planet. This revelation almost makes him give up on the mission and pushes him closer to insanity.

When Bower's group finds the reactor, they find a large crowd of mutants sleeping around it. Bower tries to access the reactor computer by sneaking, but fails. While Manh distracts the mutants, Bower restarts the reactor, killing many mutants. Leland flees, and Manh is cornered by the mutant leader. In a one-on-one fight, Manh kills the leader, but is then killed by a mutant child that he hesitates to slay.

As Gallo becomes increasingly aggressive, Payton grows more worried, and prepares a [[sedative]] injection to subdue him. After the power is restored, Payton attempts to access the bridge, but Gallo assaults him and injects him with his own syringe. Gallo suddenly disappears, leaving Payton holding the syringe in his own hand. It is revealed that Gallo killed the real Payton long ago. Because he went in Payton's pod, he mistakenly believed himself to be Payton.

Leland makes his way to the bridge, and Gallo kills him by stabbing him with the syringe. When Bower and Nadia confront him, Gallo opens the shutters on the bridge's windows, revealing that the ship is adrift in deep space with no [[stars]] visible. The shock from the revelation pushes Bower even further to insanity and he begins to break down. Taking advantage of Bower's mental state, Gallo tries to convince him that they must maintain the violent society rather than attempt to revive civilization.

However, Nadia observes [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] ocean life through the windows, and the computer displays that 923 years have elapsed since the mission launched. It turns out that the ship reached Tanis 800 years ago, and automatically landed itself in the ocean. Gallo attacks Bower and Nadia, and Bower hallucinates mutants invading the bridge. In his delirium, Bower accidentally breaks a window and water pours into the ship. Nadia manages to snap Bower to reality, and they climb into a hypersleep pod, while Gallo and the remaining mutants drown. The flood triggers an emergency protocol which ejects all active pods to the surface.

Bower and Nadia surface near a lush [[coastline]], and witness the other pods ascending one by one. Thus begins Year One on Tanis, with 1,213 survivors from the original 60,000 passengers.

== Production ==
The film began life as a preliminary script written by Travis Milloy in the late 1990s. The story was originally set on a prison ship named ''Pandorum'', transporting thousands of Earth's deadliest prisoners to another planet; the cannibal hunters were the end result of the prisoners' degeneration. The characters played by [[Antje Traue]] and [[Cung Le]] were inmates. [[Ben Foster]]'s character was a non-prisoner who did not trust anyone.

Believing no studio would want to make the film, Milloy thought about making it as a low-budget film shot on video in an abandoned paper mill with unknown actors. However, it attracted the attention of filmmaker [[Paul W. S. Anderson]] and [[Jeremy Bolt]], and they gave it to Impact Pictures, who green-lit it. The producers gave the script to director [[Christian Alvart]] who was struck by the similarities to his own screenplay titled ''No Where''. His dramatic story was about four astronauts aboard a settlers' ship who suffer from amnesia. Alvart decided that they should meld the two screenplays together, and the producers and Milloy agreed. With the ship now changed to a settler's ship, the use of the word "Pandorum" was changed from the name of the ship to a type of mental illness caused by sustained deep space travel.<ref name="fieldingonfilm1">{{cite web|url=http://fieldingonfilm.com/wp/travis-milloy-writer-pandorum/ |title=Travis Milloy |publisher=Fielding on Film |date=9 December 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref>

''Pandorum'' was announced in May 2008 with Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster in lead roles. Christian Alvart was attached to direct the film, based on a script by Travis Milloy. The movie was financed by [[Constantin Film]] through a joint venture deal with subsidiary Impact Pictures.<ref name="quaid">{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117985339.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 |title=Quaid, Foster set for ‘Pandorum’ |publisher=Variety |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref>  The partnership helped fund the $40 million production.

Summit Entertainment handled foreign sales and presented ''Pandorum'' to buyers at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], but due to a deal with Contender Films in the UK, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures took over and handled foreign sales to the film.<ref name="quaid" /> [[Overture Films]] distributed ''Pandorum'' in North America, Icon in the United Kingdom and Australia, Svensk in Scandinavia, and Movie Eye in Japan. The film was set up as a possible franchise. According to Travis Milloy, it was to have a sequel and a prequel.<ref name="fieldingonfilm1"/>  If it performed well, Impact Pictures could [[green-light]] one or more sequels.<ref name="impact" />

The [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]] release occurred on 19 January 2010 in the United States<ref>{{cite web|author=Overture Films |url=http://www.pandorummovie.com/ |title=PANDORUM - Now Available on DVD & Blu-ray |publisher=Pandorummovie.com |date= |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> over [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton |first=Steve |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34552/exclusive-shock-festival-wallpapers-and-radio-spots |title=Exclusive: Shock Festival Wallpapers and Radio Spots |publisher=Dread Central |date=16 November 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref>

The director and producer commentaries on the DVD indicate that an unrated version of the movie exists but has not been released.

The film had gained a [[cult following]], as in 2010 fans started a Facebook group, with users urging a ''Pandorum'' sequel. Director Christian Alvart later became a member of the group. The group currently has nearly 4,000 members.<ref>https://www.facebook.com/groups/101973326519796/</ref>

== Reception ==
Pandorum gained mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 29% based on 84 reviews, and an average rating of 4.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "While it might prove somewhat satisfying for devout sci-fi fans, ''Pandorum''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bloated, derivative plot ultimately leaves it drifting in space."<ref name="rottentomatoes">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pandorum/ |title=Pandorum (2009) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which judges on a 0–100 scale, the film holds a "generally unfavorable" score of 28 based on 13 reviews.<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web |title=Pandorum Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=15 March 2018 |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pandorum}}</ref>

The film grossed $20,645,327 worldwide, failing to bring back its $33 million budget.<ref name=boxofficemojo.com/> The film opened at #6 at the US box office with weekend receipts totaling $4,424,126. Poor return due to lack of promotion was a contributing factor to Overture Films' declaration of bankruptcy several months later.<ref>{{cite news | title=Overture Films ends three-year run, hands off marketing and distribution to Relativity Media | first=Claudia | last=Eller | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/07/overture-films-is-over.html | date=July 23, 2010 | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=November 28, 2017 }}</ref>
