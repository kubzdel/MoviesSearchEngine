==Plot==
Amy ([[Danielle Harris]]) prepares to leave her job at the city morgue while Seth ([[Kaj-Erik Eriksen]]) and their boss Holden ([[Michael Eklund]]) work the [[graveyard shift]]. As Amy is leaving to meet friends at a bar for her birthday, Holden receives news that a number of bodies are being delivered, the victims of a mass murder committed by Jacob Goodnight ([[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]) at the Blackwell Hotel. Amy decides to cancel her plans and help her colleagues with the deliveries. Amy and Seth process the corpses, including that of Goodnight. As Amy leaves Seth to finish the work, she is surprised to find Holden has allowed her friends Tamara ([[Katharine Isabelle]]), Kayla ([[Chelan Simmons]]), Carter (Lee Majdoub) and her brother Will ([[Greyston Holt]]) to throw a birthday party in the morgue. During the party, Will warns Seth to stay away from Amy, believing she deserves better than him, causing Seth to leave the party and return to work. Will tells Amy of his disapproval of her dropping out of Med School to work in the morgue, angering Amy, who also leaves the party.

Tamara, who is fascinated by death and [[serial killers]], leaves the party with Carter to go look at Jacob's body. The experience of being in a room with the body of a real murderer arouses her and she and Carter begin to have sex. Jacob suddenly awakens, and kills Carter while Tamara escapes. Jacob searches the room, outfitting himself with a burn victim mask and several surgical tools before cutting the building's electricity.

Hearing Tamara's screams, the rest of the partygoers attempt to find her; Holden, away from the rest, is captured and mortally wounded by Jacob.

Amy, Will, Kayla and Tamara acknowledge their predicament and attempt to reach the upper levels of the hospital, only to find Jacob blocking their way at every turn. Seth arrives with the keys to open a locked emergency stairwell, but Jacob is behind him and attacks them, causing the group to split up. Kayla seeks refuge in a bathroom, where Jacob strangles her. When Kayla mutters "Thank God!" at Jacob's hesitation, he relives old memories, remembering the abuse he suffered at the hands of his religious mother. As Kayla dies from her injuries anyway, Jacob asks her, "Why would God help you?" before setting off in search of the remaining members of the group.

Jacob kills Tamara and captures Will, using him as bait to lure Seth and Amy into a trap, where he proceeds to execute her brother. In the resultant confrontation, Seth is wounded by an electric knife; Amy takes him into a room to cauterize the wound, where she reveals that she dropped out of medical school after realizing the inevitability of death. Noticing that one of the windows leads to ground level, Amy kisses Seth for the first time then squeezes out to get help. Finding Jacob in the parking lot, however, she retreats back inside. Afterwards, Jacob stabs her to death as she attempts to unlock a side exit door. After fighting Jacob, Seth impales him with the nozzle from a piece of embalming equipment and pumps his body full of [[embalming chemicals]], seemingly killing him.

Seth escapes the morgue through a broken window and drives away in his car. As he stops to open the gated entrance, he realizes that not only is Jacob still alive but also that he was in the car with him. Jacob attacks Seth from behind, and gouges out his eyes, killing him.

The final shots of the film show each dead member of the cast before a final closeup shot of Jacob's face as he says, "I see it now."

==Reception==
It received an approval rating of 60% on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 5 reviews.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/see_no_evil_2/</ref> William Bibbiani, writing for [[Crave Online]], praised the film's adherence to traditional slasher movie conventions, saying that "...it is indeed comforting to see that the standard, straight-up slasher yarn still has some life in it. Instead of playing to some sort of house style, like many of the recent slasher remakes were determined to do, ''See No Evil 2'' looks pleasingly grim and icy and dark. What’s more, it plays with genre expectations while playing the genre’s actual conventions somewhat straight..."<ref name=crave>{{cite web|last=Bibbiani |first=William| url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/reviews/776515-see-no-evil-2-review| title=See No Evil 2 Review: Socket to Me, Baby|date = October 2014|accessdate=2014-10-20}}</ref>

[[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film a mixed review, praising the film's characterization and first act, but saying that "once Jacob Goodnight begins stalking the halls everything slows to a crawl. Maybe it’s because the environment was so generic, or maybe it was because it’s not a franchise I care to see continue on...". Nonetheless, the review concluded that "I wish this were a standalone sequel instead of being forced into a corner in trying to continue the events from 8 years ago. But as it stands, ''See No Evil 2'' is a fun little VOD rental for your Halloween festivities."<ref name=bloody>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3316598/review-see-evil-2-worth-halloween-look/| title=See No Evil 2 Worth a Halloween Look|date = October 2014|accessdate=2014-10-20}}</ref>

Ryan Larson, writing for [[ComingSoon.net]], gave the film an average rating saying "While some of the movie is enjoyable due to standard gore splashed slasher fare, for the most part you can't help but think 'haven't I seen this already?'"<ref>{{cite web|last=Larson|first=Ryan|title=Review: See No Evil 2 a Standard Slasher With Missed Potential|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/744192-review-see-evil-2-standard-slasher-missed-potential|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>

[[Dread Central]]'s Scott Hallam gave the film a mixed review praising the directors, Jen and Sylvia Soska, but calling the script "a cookie-cutter slasher" ultimately summing up his review with "If you’re in it for some cool kills done by a cool killer as seen through the eyes of the Twisted Twins and you don’t mind the fact that the story is pretty typical, you’ll dig ''See No Evil 2''."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hallam|first=Scott|title=See No Evil 2 (Blu-ray / DVD)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/70621/see-evil-2-blu-ray-dvd/|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}</ref>
