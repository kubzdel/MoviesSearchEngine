==Critical reception==
Sean Decker of the [[Dread Central]] gave ''Rosewood Lane'' 1 out of 5 stars, saying "the film is rife with baffling plot turns, characters who consistently make the most illogical of decisions, abandoned sub-plots (and players), plot holes a'plenty and a second act sequence that betrays the third reel's reveal (a reveal that ultimately makes little sense anyway)".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/rosewood-lane-2011 | title=Rosewood Lane (2011) | work=Dread Central | date=October 28, 2011 | accessdate=June 7, 2013 | first=Sean |last=Decker}}</ref>
