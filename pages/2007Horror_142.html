'''''Joshua''''' (also known as '''''The Devil's Child''''') is a 2007 American [[psychological horror]] film about an affluent young [[Manhattan]] family and how they are torn apart by the increasingly [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] behavior of their disturbed son, Joshua. The film was directed and co-written by George Ratliff, and stars [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Vera Farmiga]] and [[Jacob Kogan]]. It was released on July 6, 2007, in the United States by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].

==Plot==
Brad and Abby Cairn are an affluent New York couple with two children. Their firstborn, a self-decided conservatively dressed 9-year-old, Joshua, is a [[child prodigy]] on the piano with a marked predilection for "dissonant" [[classical music|classical]] pieces. He demonstrates limitless ability, to such a degree that he thinks and acts old before his time. 

Joshua gravitates toward his clueless and oblivious Uncle Ned as a close friend, but distances himself from his immediate kin, particularly following the birth of his sister, Lily. As the days pass, bizarre events transpire as the mood at the house regresses from healthy and happy to strange and disorienting. As the baby's whines drive an already strained Abby to the point of a nervous breakdown, Joshua devolves from eccentric to downright sociopathic behavior, while Brad tries to keep things together but finds he can't help his wife, do well at his demanding job, or match wits with his sociopathic son. 

Joshua causes a fight between his mother (who is [[Judaism|Jewish]], but [[Irreligion|non-religious]]) and paternal grandmother (who is an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] and who constantly [[proselytism|proselytizes]] Joshua) when he tells his parents he wants to become a [[Christianity|Christian]]. Abby gets very angry and swears at the grandmother, telling her to leave her house immediately. Joshua later convinces his mother to join him in a game of hide-and-seek. As Abby counts to fifty, Joshua takes his sister from her crib to hide with him, causing his mother to panic and pass out while searching for them in the empty penthouse above them, before he puts his sister back into the crib to make it look as though his mother was hallucinating the entire incident.

Later, after discussing Abby's psychological problems with his brother-in-law Ned (who is sympathetic to Brad but also thinks that Abby will be fine given some time), Brad takes two weeks off from his job to look after Abby and her children, and his mother makes him feel worse by recounting all the ways he is failing as a husband and father, tying their problems to the evils of life in the big city, and demanding he quit his job and move the family to a rural area where they can be religious and happy. When he arrives home, Joshua has gone to the Brooklyn Museum with his sister and their grandmother Hazel ([[Celia Weston]]). Joshua frightens his grandmother by describing to her in detail about [[Set (deity)|Seth]], the [[Egypt]]ian God of Chaos, and his violent acts. While they are at the museum, Brad watches a video tape of Joshua scaring his sister with a light, making her cry. He arrives at the museum, just in time to see Joshua attempt to push his sister in her carriage down a large flight of stairs, but he stops when he is caught by his grandmother, whom he proceeds to push down the large staircase, killing her and disguising it as an accident. However, Brad is convinced Joshua pushed her and confides in Ned at the funeral. By this point, Abby has had a complete psychotic breakdown and been institutionalized.

That night, Brad installs a lock on his bedroom door and tells Joshua that his sister will be sleeping with him, fearing Joshua will attempt to do something to his sister. That night, Joshua builds a house of blocks in the living room and provokes his father. Brad tells him he won't be able to hurt anyone else, as he now realizes he is causing trouble. Later that week, on Ned's recommendation, Brad brings Betsy ([[Nancy Giles]]), a [[psychology|psychologist]], into the home to meet Joshua. Betsy talks to Joshua and sees his disturbing drawings and comes to the erroneous conclusion that Joshua is being [[child abuse|abused]]. Later, Brad tells him he is being sent away to a [[boarding school]], causing Joshua to run away. When Brad arrives home, he finds Joshua hiding in a cupboard, crying hysterically with a large bruise on his back. 

The next morning, he and Joshua go for a walk with his sister, but Joshua has stolen her pacifier, causing her to cry. When Brad confronts him, he begins to mock him, causing Brad to strike him. After Brad realizes what he did, he tries to apologize. Joshua further taunts him, which drives Brad to beating his son in public, strengthening Joshua's case of abuse and sending Brad to jail for child abuse and assault. In addition, it is indicated that Joshua has framed his father for tampering with his mother's medications, suggesting that Brad will spend the rest of his life in prison, leaving Ned to adopt Joshua and his sister.

In the last scene of the film, Joshua is playing a piano while his uncle Ned is talking to a person on the phone about having a [[nanny]] to take care of his sister. Afterwards, Ned sits with Joshua and the two compose a song with Joshua singing an original song. The lyrics of the song are basically how Joshua's parents both will never be loved by anyone now, and it is revealed in the song that he only wanted to be with Ned and got rid of everyone else. Ned's expression is ambiguous, hinting he may have figured out what Joshua is really like, as the film ends.

The site's consensus reads, "Though ''Joshua'' is ultimately too formulaic, its intelligence and suspenseful buildup heighten the overall creep factor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joshua/|title=Joshua (2007)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film scored a 69 out of 100 rating, based on 25 critic reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/joshua|title=Joshua Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref>

Duane Byrge of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that the film was "a brilliant house-of-horror tale with [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] flare".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808331/criticreviews|title=Joshua (2007) Review|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Duane|last=Byrge|date=January 27, 2007}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that the film is "something vitally new... that has a cool and savvy fun with your fears" — he also noted that it is "a superbly crafted psychological thriller".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20045353,00.html|title=Joshua Review|date=July 10, 2007|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman}}</ref> Elizabeth Weitzman of ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' wrote: "None of this would have worked without the ideal child, and Kogan, making his movie debut, gets a difficult role down perfectly. Ratliff avoids turning him into a typical bad seed, and shows the same restraint at nearly every turn. With deliberate pacing, well-placed scares, and a pitch-black sense of humor, Ratliff keeps us guessing until the stunner finish."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/neonatal-attraction-article-1.264393|title=Neonatal attraction|date=July 26, 2007|website=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|first=Elizabeth|last=Weitzman}}</ref>

[[Maitland McDonagh]] of ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, writing: "Ratliff and co-screenwriter David Gilbert are clearly aiming for the highbrow suspense market rather than the down-and-dirty horror crowd, but their script's obviousness strips the story of suspense and turns it into a tedious slog to a predestined end."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/joshua/review/288372|title=Joshua, 2007, Movie|website=[[TV Guide]]|first=Maitland|last=McDonagh|access-date=June 12, 2016}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote: "Two things: the audience is ahead of the movie, and the movie never catches up. In the first scene we look at the kid, we look at the family and we get it. We get all there is to get. A strangely composed boy sits in his suit and tie, banging away at a [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] piano piece for a school recital, while his parents ooh and aah over their newborn daughter. Joshua is a very bad kid, and he is going to do very bad things."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Such-a-little-terror-Truly-2581887.php|title=Such a little terror.
