The film tells the story of Kristy who, wakes up to find herself trapped beneath the ruins of a dilapidated wooden roller coaster inside an abandoned [[amusement park]]. She quickly finds herself being terrorized by the myths and [[urban legends]] that have become part of [[Chippewa Lake]]’s 130-year history. While attempting to escape, Kristy runs into James, whose parents are the caretakers of the park. 
James listens to Kristy and helps her investigate.  James discovers that he, too, is now trapped inside the park. Kristy and James encounter a mysterious [[carny]] in clown makeup, who once was responsible for operating the amusement park’s [[roller coaster]] but who died many years previously.  He advises the couple that their only escape is to relive and survive all the life-threatening tales from the park’s past and to ride the now-operational rides in the park one final time.
