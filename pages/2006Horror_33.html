==Reception==
Mitchell Hattaway, writing for [[DVD Verdict]], gave a negative review. He said that "''The Butcher'' was shot on cheap digital videotape, and the disc's transfer is flat, dull, and noisy. There is little channel separation in the stereo soundtrack, and dialogue sounds tinny and canned. An assortment of previews is the only bonus feature. I would be remiss if I didn't give the filmmakers props for their one original idea: I'm pretty sure this is the only movie in the history of cinema in which a character is killed by being drowned in a bathtub filled with strawberry Nestl√©'s Quik. Eat your heart out, Mr. Hitchcock."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of The Butcher|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/thebutcher.php|publisher=[[DVD Verdict]]|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> ''HorrorTalk'' wrote that "Right off the bat, The Butcher is going to be a love-it or hate-it film for most, due to the fact that its sole purpose of being nothing more than a torture horror film at its most basic level."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Butcher|url=http://www.horrortalk.com/index.php/reviews/692-the-butcher|publisher=HorrorTalk|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> [[DreadCentral]] wrote that: "Originally entitled The Harvest, Lionsgate realized that was just too generic and changed it to the almost nearly as generic The Butcher. Considering the film doesn't seem to have an original idea in its body or any intention of even trying to come up with an original idea or the ability to do anything even remotely creative with its recycled material, a more fitting title would have been The Nevada Wrong Turn Massacre."<ref>{{cite web|title=DreadCentral: The Butcher|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/butcher-the-dvd|publisher=[[DreadCentral]]|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref>
