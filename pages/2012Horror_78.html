==Plot==
A young man, Kunle ([[Saheed Balogun]]) commits a grievous act that leaves his family members in anguish. In [[Lagos]], Kunle hides cocaine in his mother's ([[Lanre Hassan]]) baggage before she pays a visit to his siblings, including the eldest brother Femi ([[Sola Fosudo]]) in [[London]]. His mother narrowly escapes from the British immigration officers.
A rescheduled flight to the UK foils Kunle’s plans to retrieve the illegal drug. Before his arrival, Femi’s wife ([[Sola Sobowale]]) incidentally sees it while unpacking the food items stuffed along with the drug. A student in London, Moyo who is sponsored by Femi, gets remunerated by the drug deals after stealing it from where it is hidden, but the enraged drug barons, led by the Don ([[Segun Arinze]]) and his gang, unleash terror on Kunle’s family. Suspense fills the air when Femi or nobody makes any attempt to find Moyo at his school since he is assumed to be in danger. Contrary to expectations, he is on a celebration spree in London before his inevitable arrest.<ref name=punch/>
