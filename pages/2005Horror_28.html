==Plot==
Marcus Cutter and a bunch of mercenaries steal [[Attila the Hun]]'s breastplate from a museum in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. They kill the curator Professor Radu before they escape by helicopter.

Meanwhile, Samantha Gaines, Professor Radu's best student, organises an exhibition in [[New York City]]. While she awaits the breastplate, her brother Zach is abducted because Cutter and his men need her support. The breastplate is presumed to lead to a legendary [[Sword of Mars]], which makes its owner invincible. Samantha deciphers the inscriptions and finds where the item is hidden. Unfortunately the three–headed dog [[Cerberus]] who protects it is more than a legend.

Once Cutter gets his hands on the sword itself he kills everybody who gets in his way, including former Korean general Kul Jae Sung, who originally paid him to deliver the weapon. Samantha has to tackle the momentarily invincible Cutter and the actually immortal beast Cerberus at the same time.
