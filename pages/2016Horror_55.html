'''''The Disappointments Room''''' is a 2016 American [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[D. J. Caruso]], written by Caruso from a script by [[Wentworth Miller]], and starring [[Kate Beckinsale]] and [[Mel Raido]] as a couple in a new house that contains a hidden room with a dark, haunted past. The film was inspired by an HGTV episode from a segment called “If Walls Could Talk”.

Originally completed in 2014, the film was only released in September 9, 2016 by [[Rogue Pictures|Rogue]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/relativity-moves-up-kate-beckinsale-thriller-the-disappointments-room-by-2-months/|title=Relativity Moves Up Kate Beckinsale Thriller ‘The Disappointments Room’ by 2 Months|website=[[The Wrap]]|first=Meriah|last=Doty|date=August 15, 2016|accessdate=August 17, 2016}}</ref> to both critical and [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing only $5 million from a $15 million budget.

==Plot==
Looking for a fresh start after the accidental death of their infant daughter Catherine, [[architect]] Dana Barrow ([[Kate Beckinsale]]) moves with her husband David ([[Mel Raido]]) and 5-year-old son Lucas from [[Brooklyn]] to the Blacker estate in rural [[North Carolina]], a once-grand dream home that has sat abandoned and run-down since the death of its original owners in the 19th century. Upon her arrival, Dana begins having unsettling visions and nightmares of a mysterious [[German Shepherd]] and of Lucas covered in blood. While exploring the grounds outside, Dana finds what appears to be a homemade gravestone engraved with the drawing of a [[kite]], when she sees a light turn on in the house's attic, seemingly of its own accord. Heading upstairs, Dana finds an area of the house not listed in the [[blueprint]]s, a room whose entrance is blocked off by a large [[armoire]]. With David, she manages to push the cabinet out of the way, only to find a locked door. Dana finds the key hidden atop the door frame, and enters the room alone the next day, only for the door to suddenly close and lock of its own accord. Dana experiences a vision of a young girl being tormented by her father and his German Shepherd, and subsequently suffers a [[nervous breakdown]].

Dana eventually makes it out of the room, but is deeply shaken by her experience. She begins to research the history of the house, learning about its namesake Judge Ernest Blacker ([[Gerald McRaney]]) and his daughter Laura, who died on the same day as Catherine; July 5. Dana consults the local historian Judith, who tells her the Blacker family had a secret "disappointments room" in the attic, where wealthy socialite families cruelly shuttered their deformed or disabled children. As she spends more time researching the house and its history, Dana's mental state begins to unravel, and she stops taking her medication. She begins having increasingly vivid and disturbing visions of Laura, Judge Blacker, and the dog, and begins acting erratically toward David and Lucas. She finds a portrait of Judge Blacker and Mrs. Blacker hidden behind a pair of facing mirrors, and burns it.

While David entertains family friends, Dana hires local [[handyman]] Ben Philips ([[Lucas Till]]), who has been performing maintenance on the house's leaking roof, to dig up the grave in the backyard. The ghost of Judge Blacker suddenly manifests and kills Ben with a shovel. Dana discovers Ben's body hanging from a [[noose]] above the open grave, inside of which sits Laura's deformed skeleton. Dana sees another light appear in the attic, and when she goes inside, finds the portrait she burned intact and in their place. Entering the disappointments' room, she witnesses a flashback of Judge Blacker murdering Laura with a hammer as his wife futilely tries to stop him. Blacker's dog attacks Dana as he moves toward Lucas' bedroom. Dana breaks the dog's neck and picks up the hammer, running to Lucas' room and stopping Blacker from killing her son by repeatedly bashing him in the head with it. David rushes in, seeing Dana frantically hitting an empty bed. He tries to get her to calm down, telling her that there's no one there.

Calming down, Dana reflects on Catherine's death, revealing that she accidentally smothered her, triggering her slow spiral into insanity. She realizes that she can no longer tell what's real when she realizes that she was hallucinating Ben's murder and corpse. David vows that they will return to Brooklyn, and that Dana will get better. Before leaving, David removes the door from the disappointments' room, and Dana takes one of Laura's figurines. As they drive away, Dana spots Judge Blacker looking down at them from the window.

==Production==
The production on the film began on September 8, 2014, in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. On October 20, Kate Beckinsale, Mel Raido and Michaela Conlin were filmed outside buildings on South Elm Street in Greensboro. The same buildings were used for exteriors, but the interior filming for the scenes represented by those buildings took place on Fourth Street in nearby [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]. The house used for the main location was the [[Tudor Revival architecture|English Tudor]] style Adamsleigh estate, built in 1930 and designed by [[Northrup & O'Brien|Luther Lashmit]], at [[Sedgefield Country Club]] outside Greensboro.<ref>{{cite news|last=Clodfelter|first=Tim|title=Beckinsale films scenes on Fourth Street|work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|date=October 25, 2014|page=A1}}</ref> The film's [[special make-up effects]] were provided by [[Greg Nicotero|KNB EFX.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/09/09/the-disappointments-room-isnt-worthy-of-your-lame-puns|title=THE DISAPPOINTMENTS ROOM Isn’t Worthy Of Your Lame Puns|last=Collins|first=Brian|date=2016-09-09|website=Birth.Movies.Death.|access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>

During the film's lengthy post-production process, a number of key scenes and subplots were either trimmed or cut entirely. These include a flashback sequence of a [[garden party]] held by the Blackers while Laura hopelessly looks on from the attic, and a scene of Mrs. Blacker being killed by her husband's dog as retaliation for trying to save Laura.
