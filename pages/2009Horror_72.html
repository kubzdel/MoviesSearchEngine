==Plot==
Sam ([[Torrance Coombs]]) has always been obsessed with vampires from the time he was a child watching them on children’s programs to when he was a college student reading horror novels on the side.
On Sam’s 21st birthday, a mysterious gentleman offers him a peculiar career choice: become an [[Familiar spirit|assistant]] to a real-life Vampire. Intrigued and enthusiastic, Sam takes the job and meets Simon Bolivar (Paul Hubbard), a 400-year-old Vampire.
Everything about the Vampire does hold some truth to it; a truth followed by a dose of hard-reality.  Sam soon realizes that it is not so cool or pleasant to serve his corrupt and neurotic behavior.

==Inspiration==
[[Kody Zimmermann]] came up with the idea reading [[Dracula]] while working as an actor's assistant: "I felt like...the vampire was a metaphor for the boss from hell.  I was always interested in the [[Renfield]] character in Dracula, and no one ever really did his story – that I know of.  What kind of a person would devote himself to this sinister, Satanic agent and still call himself a human being?  I thought that was the connection – you are crazy for being part of this world, but you are not exactly the main character, either.  I wanted to bridge those two things, and I think it fit well while I was writing it: serving this greater being while being caught up in this insanity.  A lot of us go into these jobs where we ask ourselves, “why are we doing this”.<ref name="TheFamiliar2009film-r1" />
