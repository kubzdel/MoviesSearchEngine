==Plot==
{{Plot|date=November 2017}}

After her daughter leaves for college, Claire Spencer begins noticing her volatile new neighbors, Mary and Warren Feur. Claire's husband Norman, an accomplished scientist and professor, dismisses her preoccupation. After failing to see Mary for several days, Claire suspects Warren may have killed her. Claire and her mystic friend Jody unsuccessfully hold a [[séance]] to contact Mary. Claire finds the bathtub filled with hot water and, "You know," written in the mirror. Claire then finds her computer typing "MEF" repeatedly, causing her to alert Norman. He disbelieves Claire, who is convinced that Mary is haunting her. Several days later, Mary returns home alive and well, saying that she was with her mother in [[Rhode Island]] after a fight with Warren.

Claire sees the image of a woman floating in the lake, and discovers a key inside a heater vent. In a broken picture frame, she finds a newspaper clipping of a missing woman named Madison Elizabeth Frank, who bears a striking resemblance to her, and whose initials match "MEF." Claire visits Madison's mother, and steals a lock of Madison's hair. Later that night, Claire reads about conjuring the dead, and becomes [[Spirit possession|possessed]]. When Norman arrives home from work, Claire's personality has noticeably changed, and she aggressively seduces him.  However, she suddenly stops, as she remembered that one night she had found Norman and Madison together, a fact that actually provoked later Claire's car accident. Then, Norman admits to having had an affair with Madison, who was a student. Claire spends the night with Jody, who reveals to her that she had witnessed Norman arguing with a blonde woman at a cafe in the nearby town of [[Adamant, Vermont|Adamant]] about a year earlier.

Claire returns home and finds Norman has apparently attempted suicide in the tub with a hair dryer. Claire asks Norman if he killed Madison, which he denies. He saves Claire from falling into the lake and burying Madison's hair, and the two burn it. After visiting Adamant to spot ornate lockboxes at a shop, Claire discovers from the lake an identical box, which she unlocks with the matching key; inside, she finds a necklace. Norman changes his story, claiming that Madison committed suicide in their home, and that he disposed of her body by putting it in her car and pushing it into the lake. Norman agrees to confess to authorities, calling 911 to explain the situation. Claire redials the phone to discover he actually dialed 411 (information), faking the conversation. Norman attacks her, and paralyzes her by forcibly making her inhale the anaesthetic agent halothane. Norman finally admits to murdering Madison after she had threatened to report to the dean of the university about their affair.

Norman places Claire in the bathtub, which he fills with water. He spots Madison's necklace around Claire's neck; as he moves her, her face contorts to that of Madison's corpse, causing Norman to panic and be severely injured. Recovering from the paralysis, Claire manages to shut the tap off in time to save herself from drowning. She finds that Norman has left the bathroom and discovers him seemingly unconscious downstairs. She flees in the couple's truck, which has their boat hitched to the back. As she is crossing the bridge over [[Lake Champlain]], Norman attacks Claire, who frantically dials 911 on her cell phone and causes the truck to careen down the embankment into the lake. Disturbed by the debris on her car, Madison's corpse floats toward Norman and Claire. To avenge her own death, Madison grabs and drowns Norman, allowing Claire to swim to the surface. Later in the winter, Claire places a single red rose on Madison's grave.

==Production==
Documentary filmmaker [[Sarah Kernochan]] had adapted a personal experience with the paranormal as a script treatment featuring a retirement aged couple dealing with restless but compassionate spirits. [[DreamWorks]] commissioned a rewrite from actor-writer [[Clark Gregg]]. This script was later delivered in 1998 by [[Steven Spielberg]] himself to his director friend [[Robert Zemeckis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visimag.com/starburst/268_feature.htm|title=Starburst magazine issue 268, What Lies Beneath director interview|website=www.visimag.com}}</ref> who had signed a deal for DreamWorks to distribute the films of newly founded production company  [[ImageMovers]], and announced interest in doing a thriller film.<ref name="notes">{{cite press release |url=http://cinema.com/articles/235/what-lies-beneath-production-notes.phtml |title=What Lies Beneath (2000) – Production Notes|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] |year=2000}}</ref> [[Harrison Ford]] then signed to star on the film, even agreeing to clear room in his schedule for the project.<ref>[https://variety.com/1998/voices/columns/beneath-pairs-ford-zemeckis-d-onofrio-nabs-abbie-1117471528/ ‘Beneath’ pairs Ford, Zemeckis; D’Onofrio nabs ‘Abbie”], ''Variety'', June 4, 1998.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. The film currently holds a rating of 46% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 124 reviews with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 with the site's consensus stating that "Robert Zemeckis is unable to salvage an uncompelling and unoriginal film."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_lies_beneath/ |title=What Lies Beneath Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 26, 2009}}</ref> The film received a score of 51 on [[Metacritic]] based on 35 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/what-lies-beneath |title=What Lies Beneath reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]]  |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that, "at the start, [Zemeckis] zaps us with quick, glib scares, just to show he still knows how, but his heart isn't in this kind of material anymore. His reflexes are a little slow."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/072100beneath-film-review.html |first=Elvis |last=Mitchell |title='What Lies Beneath': If Only Her Husband Hadn't Made That Horrible Mistake |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=July 21, 2000 |accessdate= }}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it "spooky with a polished kind of creepiness added in...

The first hour is great fun... It’s an enjoyably giddy ride, certainly, but once you’re back from the edge of your seat, you realise most of the creaks and groans are from the decomposing script."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=6237 |title=Review of What Lies Beneath |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' |date= |accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}</ref>

[[Michelle Pfeiffer]] received some positive notice for her performance. [[Roger Ebert]] called her "convincing and sympathetic."<ref name="ebert"/>

In his review, Ebert said that he felt the problem with Zemeckis' desire to direct a Hitchcockian film was to involve the supernatural (the film contains several musical, visual and plot references to [[Psycho (1960 film)|''Psycho'']] and [[Vertigo (film)|''Vertigo'']], among other Hitchcock films), which he believes to be something [[Alfred Hitchcock]] himself would never have done.<ref name="ebert" />
