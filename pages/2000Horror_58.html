'''''Pitch Black''''' (titled '''''The Chronicles of Riddick: Pitch Black''''' on its DVD re-release) is a 2000 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[David Twohy]]. The film stars [[Vin Diesel]], [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Cole Hauser]], and [[Keith David]]. Dangerous criminal [[Riddick (character)|Richard B. Riddick]] (Diesel) is being transported to prison in a spacecraft. When the spaceship is damaged by [[comet]] debris and makes an emergency crash landing on an empty [[desert planet]], Riddick escapes. However, when predatory alien creatures begin attacking the survivors, Riddick joins forces with the surviving crew and other passengers to develop a plan to escape the planet.

''Pitch Black'' was the final film credit of [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]], which merged with [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] during production. It was shot on a modest budget of US$23 million. Despite mixed reviews from critics, it was a [[sleeper hit]], grossing over $53 million worldwide and developing its own [[cult following]], particularly around the [[antihero]] Riddick. A sequel, ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick]]'', was released in 2004 by Universal, with Diesel back as the title character and Twohy returning as writer and director. A third film, simply titled ''[[Riddick (film)|Riddick]]'', was released in 2013, with Diesel and Twohy reuniting again.

==Plot==
In the distant future, the ship ''Hunter-Gratzner'' is transporting passengers in [[suspended animation|cryostasis]]. Among those, a [[Muslim]] preacher who goes by the title "[[Imam]]" accompanied by three young sons traveling to New Mecca, a boy named Jack, a pair of [[Prospecting|prospectors]] named Shazza and Zeke, a merchant named Paris, and a law enforcement officer, Johns, escorting the notorious criminal Richard B. Riddick. Riddick has surgically modified eyes that allow him to see in the dark but are highly sensitive to light.

Debris from a comet tail ruptures the ship's hull, killing the captain and sending the ship off course. The surviving crew members attempt to land the ship on a nearby planet. As the ship falls apart, docking pilot Carolyn Fry attempts to dump the passenger section to reduce their weight, but co-pilot Owens prevents her. During the crash landing, several passenger compartments are destroyed and Owens sustains fatal injuries. 

The group explores their surroundings, noticing that the three suns surrounding the planet keep it in perpetual daylight. They find an abandoned [[geology|geological research]] settlement, with a water well and a [[dropship (science fiction)|dropship]] with drained batteries. Zeke is killed but his body is missing, and Riddick is immediately suspected. While searching for Zeke's body, Fry barely escapes from [[photosensitive]] aggressive underground creatures. Johns offers Riddick a deal: if he helps them escape the planet, he'll go free.

The group takes a power cell to the dropship. They realize the geologists must have been all killed by the creatures. One of the young sons is ambushed and eaten inside one of the buildings. An [[orrery]] shows that an eclipse is imminent so the creatures will be free to hunt above ground. Johns informs the others that Riddick is able to pilot the dropship and Riddick reveals to Fry that Johns is actually a [[bounty hunter]] and a [[morphine]] addict.

They return to the crash site on a [[solar energy|solar-powered]] sand truck to retrieve more power cells for the dropship, but the eclipse begins before they can get back. Flying predators pour out of the ground and devour first Shazza then another pilgrim. The group salvages any light source they can find in an attempt to scare away the creatures and return to the dropship on foot. Riddick agrees to lead them in the dark thanks to his special sight. After Paris is also killed, Riddick reveals that Jack is actually female and the scent of her [[menstruation|menstrual blood]] is attracting the creatures. Johns suggests to Riddick to use Jack as bait to keep the creatures off the rest of the group during the final stretch of their march, but Riddick engages Johns in a hand to hand fight, wounds him and leaves him as a distraction instead. The rest of the survivors push on, while Riddick drags the power cells behind him. 

After the last Muslim child is killed and rainfall starts putting out their [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov]] torches, the group, now down to Riddick, Fry, Jack and Imam, finds shelter inside a cave not far from the settlement. Riddick leaves them there and takes the power cells to the dropship. Inside the cave, they discover bio-luminescent worms, which they stuff in now-empty bottles to use as light. Fry leaves the cave and finds Riddick powering up the ship, ready to leave without them. She pleads with him to help her rescue the others, but instead he just offers to take her with him. Eventually, Riddick has a change of heart, and they return for Imam and Jack and take them to the ship, but Riddick is separated from the group and wounded by the predators. Fry goes back to help Riddick but is speared and carried off by a predator after finding him, presumably dying. Riddick makes it to the ship and waits until the last moment before engaging the engines to incinerate as many creatures as possible. While leaving the planet, Jack asks Riddick what they should tell the authorities about him; he tells her to say that Riddick died on the planet.
