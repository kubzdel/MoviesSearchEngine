==Plot==
In the town of Ft. Chicken, [[Illinois]], a fourth grade student at Ft. Chicken Elementary, Shelly Linker (Sunny May Allison), consumes a tainted black-dotted [[chicken nugget]], this chicken nugget is contaminated with a mutant [[virus]] known as "[[Cooties]]". Elsewhere, wannabe [[Horror story|horror]] writer Clint Hadson ([[Elijah Wood]]) substitutes at Ft. Chicken Elementary, where he reunites with his former [[high school]] crush, Lucy McCormick, ([[Alison Pill]]), only to discover that she is already dating Wade Johnson ([[Rainn Wilson]]), the Physical Education teacher.

During class, Shelly, who had been experiencing numerous symptoms of strange wheezing and blisters on the face, brutally attacks her classmate, Patriot ([[Cooper Roth]]) after he tugs on one of her pigtails only to have it torn out of her scalp in the process. In response, she bites the skin off his cheek, infecting him with the virus; she also claws Clint, but he appears to show no symptoms. Though she tries to escape the school by digging her way out before she fully turns, Shelly turns feral and passes the virus to Dink (Miles Elliot), another bully and Patriot's friend by clawing his cheek (while he was trying to scold her for attacking his friend). Dink, now infected with the virus, spreads the virus throughout the playground by scratching the rest of the children, resulting in the other children becoming infected and attacking the school staff; Mr. Pederson, Miss Nash, Mrs. Gordon, Nurse Rhonda, Vice Principal Simms and Mr. Henderson are all killed by the children. A police officer ([[Matt Jones (actor)|Matt Jones]]) arrives at the scene to quell the children, not realizing that they are beyond help, but has two fingers bitten off and is then mauled by Shelly as she escapes the playground and attacks him in his car. The few surviving staff members, consisting of Clint, Lucy, Wade, Tracy Lacey ([[Jack McBrayer]]), Rebbekah Halverson ([[Nasim Pedrad]]), Doug ([[Leigh Whannell]]), and Mrs. Birk (Tammie Baird), hide in the faculty lounge but are attacked by Patriot who tackles Mrs. Birk into a cupboard and mauls her to death (Tracy, apparently unaware of her real name, screams "Who is that lady?!" when this happens).

After escaping with a single uninfected student named Calvin (whom they found in the library studying for his test), the staff barricade themselves in the music room but are discovered by Shelly, with more blisters on her face and retreats after a while.  Wade notices Clint has been infected by Shelly and quarantines him and they see that Clint is severely vomiting, but Doug deduces that the virus doesn't affect adults like it does the children. The staff decides to wait until the parents arrive to pick up the children, but this plan fails when Racer Dopkins, son of the local PTA president, infects his baby brother and that zombified baby attacks and kills his oblivious mother. Eventually, they instead manage to rescue a teenager, Tamra ([[Morgan Lily]]) by pulling on Tracy's leg which has been grasped by the zombified kids, only to discover that she has also been infected when she presents a scratch on her back to them.

The staff is attacked by the children again, and Wade kills Dink by bludgeoning him to death with a fire extinguisher. Doug extracts and analyzes Dink's brain, which has turned black and rotten due to the decomposition effects caused by the virus. He concludes that the virus is only dangerous to the prepubescent (not going through [[puberty]]), which is why Clint and Tamra didn't turn feral as they had passed that stage. The staff and uninfected children unite with the local school janitor, Mr. Hitachi (Peter Kwong), but Calvin passes out due to diabetic shock. The group opts to send Clint through the ventilation system to gather a chocolate bar for Calvin, Wade's truck keys, and their cellphones. Lucy joins Clint and the two confess their feelings to each other while trapped in the library. Wade also apologizes for his behavior over a walkie-talkie. Although, they lost contact with each other. Thanks to Patriot, they manage to secure a chocolate bar and bring Calvin out of diabetic shock. The group then reunites after Clint knocks out several children with drugs causing them to overdose, utilizing various tools in the school as weapons, and together, they head outside only to discover a horde of infected children. Working together they manage to fight their way through although Hitachi is seemingly killed inside while Wade, realizing they need time to escape, apparently sacrifices himself to ensure the others get away.

After killing a stowaway Patriot by crushing him against a tree, the group arrives in the nearby town of Danville, where they discover that it has been similarly overrun by the infected children. The group then learns that the viral infection has spread across the United States, with schools burning to the ground and reports of violence and destruction caused by children who have been infected with the virus, only to be ambushed by a small horde of infected children. They barricade themselves inside a building and manage to retrieve a chicken nugget that is contaminated with the virus, which Doug will use to possibly make a vaccination for the virus. When the survivors attempt to leave the building the now found evidence of the case,  they stumble upon a funhouse playroom with the biggest horde of infected children (the group has ever seen), including Shelly. When the group is about to accept death, they hear a car arriving at the scene and the children stop to hear. Wade and Mr. Hitachi arrive and rescue the group. As Wade uses a massive beach ball to barricade the children inside, he sprays them with water. As he pulls out shades and a lighter, he reveals the liquid to be gasoline and not water and burns the funhouse to the ground from inside. They then escape in crossing guard Rick's ([[Jorge Garcia]]) van, driving out of the town to "someplace kids don't wanna go". A flaming Shelly attempts to pursue them, but she falls down and burns to death which eventually allows them to make their escape.

In the after-credits scene, Mr. Hitachi is shown sitting down, wielding a machete and finishes the frog and caterpillar story.

===Critical reception===
''Cooties'' holds a 45% approval rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 38 reviews and an average rating of 5.2/10. The critical consensus reads: "A horror-comedy without enough of either, ''Cooties'' is fatally content to skate by on its intriguingly oddball premise."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cooties/ |title=Cooties (2015) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a rating of 49 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cooties |title=Cooties Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

Kyle Burton of ''[[Indiewire]]'' gave the film a B+ and said, "Gore can only go so far in the service of humor. Fortunately, the team behind ''Cooties''—which includes ''Saw'' creator Leigh Whannell and ''Glee'' creator Ian Brennan—manage to pit comedy and horror together in a satisfying package. With mainstay comedy faces, ''Cootie'' could reach a larger audience than other similar cultish work. It's the best play on the recent zombie craze, and while not as well-timed as ''[[Zombieland]]'', it has the potential to match that movie's success with a wide enough release."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-elijah-wood-vehicle-cooties-is-gross-genre-fun|title=Sundance Review: Elijah Wood Vehicle 'Cooties' Is Gross Genre Fun|publisher=Indiewire.com|first=Kyle|last=Burton|date=January 19, 2014|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref>

Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "Circle, circle, dot, dot. A schoolyard full of anklebiters develops a genuine taste for flesh in ''Cooties'', an irreverent, off-color zom-com that seizes on the scourge of playgrounds everywhere when a spontaneous outbreak of brain-rotting, cannibalism-inducing germs erupts within a small-town elementary school. Told from the teachers’ p.o.v., this tongue-in-cheek midnight movie feels wrong in so many ways, asking a handful of irresponsible adults to bash and bludgeon their way through foaming packs of infected kids in order to save themselves. Acquired by Lionsgate at Sundance, the franchise-ready offering should benefit enormously from one of the distrib’s clever marketing campaigns."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/markets-festivals/sundance-film-review-cooties-1201073831/|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘Cooties’|publisher=Variety.com|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}</ref> Neil Genzlinger of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "though ''Cooties'' has a reasonable amount of laughs and frights, and though real teachers may find it an apt allegory for the zombielike charges in their classrooms, it’s not really funny enough to achieve grown-up cachet, and it’s too ugly and violent for younger viewers."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/18/movies/review-cooties-back-to-school-with-zombies-and-gore.html |title=Review: ‘Cooties,’ Back to School With Zombies and Gore |last=Genzlinger |first=Neil |date=2015-09-17 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>

Nick Allen for [[RogerEbert.com]] gave the film one and a half stars, saying, "''Cooties'' is meant to be a big joke, but with such a stunted imagination for its story or style, it’s only a single gag."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/cooties-2015 |title=Cooties |last=Allen |first=Nick |date=2015-09-18 |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref> Robert Abele of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' found that the film started off promising "But as with most of these genre-tweaking romps, the fizz dissipates and what's left are obvious gore beats, lame jokes, uninspired plot mechanics and an inability to end the mayhem satisfactorily."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-cooties-movie-review-20150918-story.html |title= Review Elijah Wood, Alison Pill and Rainn Wilson run wild in horror comedy 'Cooties'  |last=Abele |first=Robert |date=2015-09-17 |website=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>
