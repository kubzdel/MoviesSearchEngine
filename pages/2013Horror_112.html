==Plot==
[[Missouri]]-born Katie Carter (Dallender) is an aspiring young model living in [[New York City]] and working as a restaurant waitress and receptionist to make ends meet. Desperate to update her modeling portfolio, she answers an advertisement offering a free photography session. She then meets three [[Bulgaria]]n brothers, photographer Ivan (Absolom) and his assistants Nikolai, known as "Nicky" (Aleksiev), and Georgy (Baharov), who becomes infatuated with Katie. She leaves the photo shoot after disagreeing with Ivan about a topless shot. Georgy later arrives at Katie's apartment and apologizes regarding the incident. Katie accepts his apology and is given a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing her photos. Before leaving, Georgy states that she can keep the pictures for her privacy and upload or use the photos as she chooses. 

Later that night, Katie wakes up to find Georgy filming her and shoots him with an [[Electroshock weapon|electroshock gun]].<!-- NB: Only an electroshock weapon sold by Taser International is a "Taser". --> Although Katie tries to escape, Georgy binds and gags her. Katie's neighbor, Jayson, upon hearing Katie's screams, arrives and finds Katie bound and gagged, but Georgy ambushes him, stabs and kills him. Georgy then proceeds to rape and [[Sodomy|sodomize]] Katie as she watches Jayson's lifeless body bleed to death on the floor. After reaching an orgasm, Georgy panics and calls both his brothers. Nikolai and Ivan later arrive and clean up all evidence of the crime. Ivan then [[Force-feeding|force-feeds]] Katie [[ketamine]], rendering her unconscious.

Katie wakes up naked and handcuffed to a pipe in a basement. Ivan tells Nicky to feed her more ketamine, but as they walk out of the basement, she forcefully vomits the drug out. Pretending to be drugged, she overpowers Georgy by hitting him with a nearby metal bucket while he attempts to redress. Katie escapes, but discovers that she is now in an unknown city. When she approaches [[National Police Service (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian police]], she is taken into safe custody by Detective Kiril (Zlaterev), who informs her that she has been abducted to Bulgaria. 

After an interview, in which Katie has to repetitively demand that she be sent to the U.S Embassy, Detective Kiril hands her over to Ana (Stockley), who claims to be from a [[rape crisis center]] but is really Nikolai and Georgy's mother. Katie is returned to the basement and Valko (Silverleaf), a friend of the family's father, [[Electric shock|electroshocks]] her genitals then brutally rapes her, leaving her bloodied. Ivan then beats her continuously.

Katie is then placed in a box with her [[crucifix]] necklace and Valko's electroshock gun and buried alive. The ground beneath the makeshift coffin caves into the [[Combined sewer|sewer system]] below. Naked and hungry, Katie steals from a nearby church and is soon caught by priest Father Dimov (Pelka), who recognizes her as a rape survivor. He gives her food, clothing and a Bible. Katie approaches the [[Diplomatic mission|U.S. Embassy]], but turns around instead. Back at the church, Dimov offers support. As Katie goes back to the sewers, she leaves her Bible open for Dimov to read. After reading the passage "vengeance is mine", Dimov realizes that Katie seeks revenge against her rapists. 

Katie first steals money from Ana's house and buys clothes, weapons and supplies. She lures Georgy into the sewers, captures him and hangs him by his arms on the wall. She tortures him with a large switchblade and smears fecal matter into his wounds to cause infection, then leaves him to a slow and painful death. Meanwhile, Dimov has contacted Detective Kiril, who realizes that Katie is still in trouble. Both men aim to stop Katie from committing crimes to her rapists and to persuade her that she would have legal justice. 

At a nightclub, Katie laces Nikolai's drink with [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. He runs to the bathroom where she drowns him in an unflushed toilet full of feces. The next day, Valko sees Katie during a church service and chases after her into the sewers where Katie strikes him with a rock. When he regains consciousness, he is strapped to a metal bed frame. Katie electroshocks his genitals with a stun stick just as how he did with her, puts a large [[plumber's snake]] into his mouth and turns it on, where it snakes its way down into his throat. She then attaches electrical cables to the bed and rooter and electrocutes him.

Ana finds her house has been burgled. Later, Katie pushes Ana into the sewers and binds her in a box and forces her to watch Georgy die. Ivan realizes that Katie has escaped; she captures him, ties him to a table and tortures him by crushing his testicles. Kiril hears Ivan and Ana's screams and follows them to the sewers. During the torture, Ivan reveals that Ana is his stepmother, who herself was [[Marital rape|raped]] by her future husband, Ivan's father. Nikolai and Georgy were products of Ana's rapes. Katie understands Ana's [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic nature]] and begins to torture Ana and Ivan, but at that moment Kiril arrives and holds his gun up to Katie. Ivan grabs and begins to strangle Katie, but Kiril shoots Ivan in the head, allowing Katie to escape. Ana, the sole survivor is arrested by Kiril for her part in her family's crimes. Katie arrives at the U.S. Embassy and the film ends.
