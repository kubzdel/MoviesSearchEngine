'''''Trollhunter''''' ({{lang-no|'''Trolljegeren'''|}}; UK: '''''Troll Hunter'''''; Canada: '''''The Troll Hunter''''') is a 2010 Norwegian [[dark fantasy]] [[horror film]], made in the form of a "[[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]" [[mockumentary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://illusion.scene360.com/movies/58773/scandinavian-films |title=10 Great Modern Scandinavian Films |last=Smail |first=Christopher |work=Illusion Magazine |publisher=Scene360 |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisishorror.co.uk/see-horror/film-reviews/the-troll-hunter-trolljegeren-2010 |title=The Troll Hunter (Trolljegeren) (2010) |last=Brookes |first=Raven |date=19 December 2011 |work=This Is Horror |accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref> It is written and directed by [[André Øvredal]], and features a mixed cast of relatively unknown actors and well-known Norwegian comedians, including [[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]. ''Trollhunter'' received positive reviews from Norwegian critics. It opened on 10 June 2011 in the US<ref name="fji"/> to a mostly positive critical reception.<ref name="Rotten"/>

==Plot==
A group of students from [[Volda University College]], Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna Mørck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans ([[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen ([[Hans Morten Hansen]]), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming "Troll!" Thomas is attacked and bitten by a large animal. They escape in Hans's [[Land Rover]] and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that he does not hunt bears, but [[troll]]s. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do as he instructs.

The next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with "troll stench" (a slimy concentrate made from "everything you can squeeze out of a troll") and checks if any of them believe in [[God]] or [[Jesus]], because a troll can smell a [[Christian]] man's blood. Hans wields a "flash gun", a weapon that emits powerful [[Ultraviolet|UV-rays]] to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls "just explode". The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll. Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to try to determine why.

The students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of trolls. The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation gets more tense as Kalle confesses that he is a Christian. The trolls eventually smell Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is killed.

The replacement camerawoman is Malica, a [[Muslim]]; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a [[Jötunn|Jotnar]], a giant mountain troll 50–100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for [[rabies]]; Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.

After several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. He directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his government agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and is seen collapsing at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black a truck is seen stopping next to the camera. Presumably the driver is the person who "found the footage". An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice.<ref name="Eggertson">{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/24457/interview-andre-ovredal-director-of-trollhunter |title=Interview: Andre Ovredal, Director of 'TrollHunter'!! |first=Chris |last=Eggertsen |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>

==Production==
Filming took place in the forests and mountains of [[Western Norway]], and actress Johanna Mørck called it an exhausting experience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ringblad.no/nyheter/article5363731.ece |title=Som et eventyr å være med på |last=Ødegård |first=Espen |work=[[Ringerikes Blad]] |language=Norwegian |date=29 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> According to director André Øvredal, the team tried to maintain maximum secrecy around the project. They kept both the title and cast secret until shortly before the première, dropping cryptic teasers to create a [[Viral marketing|viral]] effect.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/--Det-var-helt-vilt-1182052.html |title=Det var helt vilt |last1=Hole |first1=Ronald E. |last2=Ursin |first2=Lars Holger |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |language=Norwegian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref>

For the film's final scene, a clip of former Norwegian Prime minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] speaking about an oil field outside Norway called the Troll Field was edited to create the appearance of him admitting the existence of trolls.<ref name="Eggertson"/>

==Reception==
===Norway===
In a review for ''[[NRK]]'', the Norwegian Broadcasting Company; Birger Vestmo gave the film six out of six points and wrote that "a new Norwegian classic is born". He also applauded the film for combining Norwegian cultural elements with Hollywood cinematic flair.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nrkp3.no/filmpolitiet/2010/10/trolljegeren |title=Trolljegeren |last=Vestmo |first=Birger |work=[[NRK]] |language=Norwegian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=26 October 2010}}</ref> ''[[Dagbladet]]''{{'}}s Inger Merete Hobbelstad gave the film four [[Dice throw (review)|points]] out of six and compared it to ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. She complained that the [[dramaturgy]] could be better at times. The special effects she found to be of variable quality, though certain scenes were "amazing". She also highlighted Jespersen's performance as essential to the film's success.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/10/28/kultur/film/filmanmeldelser/anmeldelser/troll/14012711 |title=Tøys og tull - og troll |last=Hobbelstad |first=Inger Merete |work=[[Dagbladet]] |language=Norwegian |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> The film received four points out of six in the newspapers ''[[Klassekampen]]''<ref>{{cite news |title=Troll i ord? |last=Kulås |first=Guri |work=[[Klassekampen]] |language=Norwegian |page=28 |date=28 October 2010}}</ref> and ''[[Verdens Gang]]'' as well. ''Verdens Gang'' critic Morten Ståle Nilsen summed it up as "Better than we feared. Weaker than we could hope." Nilsen also made the comparison to ''The Blair Witch Project'' he predicted great commercial success for the film. Like Hobbelstad he appreciated Jespersen's effort.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vg.no/film/film.php?id=11497 |title=Trolls til fjells |last=Nilsen |first=Morten Ståle |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |language=Norwegian |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref>

Mode Steinkjer in ''[[Dagsavisen]]'', gave the film five out of six points. He commended Øvredal's ability to combine "subtle humour with physical tension" and also commented on the "striking naturalness" displayed by Tosterud, Larsen and Mørck as the three students.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/filmer/article511003.ece |title=Sprekker ikke |last=Steinkjer |first=Mode |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |language=Norwegian |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031034938/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/filmer/article511003.ece |archivedate=31 October 2010}}</ref> Kjersti Nipen, on the other hand, reviewing the film for ''[[Aftenposten]]'', gave the movie only three points out of six. She called it "flat, predictable and rather devoid of content". Although she regarded it as funny at times, Nipen found the use of the mockumentary format exhausted and overused.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://oslopuls.aftenposten.no/film/article452400.ece |title=Lite eventyrlig om troll |last=Nipen |first=Kjersti |work=[[Aftenposten]] |language=Norwegian |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> The review in ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' was not favourable.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sprekkeferdig |last=Eriksen |first=Ulrik |work=[[Morgenbladet]] |language=Norwegian |pages=28–29 |date=29 October 2010}}</ref>

===International===
Outside of Norway, Trollhunter received a positive reception from critics with an aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] currently holding an 82% 'Certified Fresh' rating.<ref name="Rotten">{{rotten-tomatoes|trollhunter|Trollhunter}}</ref>

Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a "clever and engaging mock documentary" with "ultradry Nordic humor", though "about 20 percent too long" with "more traveling shots through car windows of the [[fjord]]-land scenery than are absolutely necessary". The special effects, while "created with a computer-graphics budget that we can assume was far short of the Hollywood standard, are surprisingly lifelike and frightening".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/movies/trollhunter.html |title='Trollhunter' Review |last=Hale |first=Mike |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 June 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' praised star Jespersen for "what ought to be a star-making dramatic performance", and found the film "both a remarkably suspenseful voyage ... and a dry-witted commentary on the nature of expedient bureaucracy ... Part horror movie, part social satire, and bursting with Norway’s savage beauty ... [i]t is destined to be a classic of its kind."<ref name="fji">{{cite news |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/esearch/e3ide91768961c95db45d7775312258fb67 |title=Film Review: Troll Hunter |last=Lovece |first=Frank |work=[[Film Journal International]] |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> V.

==Credits==
The song "Mjød" by [[Kvelertak]] is featured over the ending credits sequence, followed by "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from Norwegian composer [[Edvard Grieg]]'s music for the play ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. The latter song's quiet, downbeat ending is abruptly followed by a VFX clip, showing the family "Mountain King" trolls (the third of four troll types depicted in the movie) clawing and shrieking at the camera. While otherwise in Norwegian, the credits end with the English phrase "No trolls were harmed during the making of this film".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Cultural references==
[[Image:Theodor Kittelsen, Soria Moria.jpg|thumb|right|The painting "[[Soria Moria Castle]]" by [[Theodor Kittelsen]]]]

''Trollhunter'' contains many references to [[Norwegian culture]] and [[Norwegian Folktales|Norwegian folktales]] in particular.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Troll Hunter |last=Gerle |first=Jörg |journal=Film-Dienst |date=April 2011 |volume=64 |issue=8 |pages=42 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Among those are the belief that there are different species of trolls, for example, the woodland and mountain trolls, which as in the film can be further categorised into subspecies. The most well-known is probably the Mountain King which is mentioned in the play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' and [[In the Hall of the Mountain King|its music]] by [[Edvard Grieg]]. The Norwegian name for Mountain King, ''Dovregubbe'', is a compound word and the first part is the same word used in the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]], which is also where the characters meet the final troll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Found Footage Horror Films : Fear and the Appearance of Reality |publisher=McFarland & Company |last=Heller-Nicholas |first=Alexandra |year=2014 |page=188 |isbn=9781476613215 }}</ref>

Other common [[Troll#Scandinavian folklore|troll descriptions]] from the Norwegian folklore which are used in the film include trolls having a tail, multiple heads, the ability to smell a Christian's blood, eating rocks, but loving meat and sometimes being man-eaters. The trolls are also described as big, old, strong, but slow and dim-witted, turning to stone when exposed to sunlight. The latter is a point emphasised in the film, as Hans uses UV light to kill the trolls. However, he also states that not everything from the tales is true.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/294439003 |title=Trolls in Film: Ashgate Encyclopedia of Literary and Cinematic Monsters |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Bann |first1=Jenny |last2=Weinstock |first2=Jeffrey Andrew |year=2014 |page=548 |isbn=9781409425632 |accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Gothic Topographies: Language, Nation Building and 'Race' |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |last1=Leffler |first1=Yvonne |editor-last1=Savolainen |editor-first1=Matti |editor-last2=Mehtonen |editor-first2=P.

The film also has several specific references to fairy tales. For example [[Boots Who Ate a Match With the Troll]] when the camera man asks about an eating contest, and the [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]] when Hans attempts to lure a troll from under a bridge using three goats. The fairy tale [[Soria Moria Castle]] is one of the tales that tells about trolls being able to smell a Christian man's blood. A painting by [[Theodor Kittelsen]] based on the same fairy tale is also used as a backdrop on one of the trips they do in the film (Thomas stands in the same pose and asks his friends "Do I look like that famous painting?"). The look of the trolls in the film is also influenced by painters like Theodor Kittelsen and [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/5799118/know-your-trolls-a-guide-to-troll-science-from-the-director-of-troll-hunter |title=Know Your Trolls: A guide to troll science from the director of TrollHunter |last=Woerner |first=Meredith |publisher=io9 |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

As reflected by how the students answer Hans, only a fraction of Norwegians consider themselves religious or visit the church regularly,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/nsd/nsdnytt/06-1/2.html |title=Få nordmenn i kirken, men ikke færre enn før |last=Mykkeltvedt |first=Alette Gilhus |publisher=Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste |language=Norwegian |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>
even though the majority of Norwegians are members of [[Church of Norway|the state church]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/07/02/10/kirke_kostra_en |title=Church of Norway, 2012 |publisher=Statistisk Sentralbyrå |date=19 June 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

The film also makes references to the often heated conflict between farmers and predators eating their livestock and the farmers' limited ability to react without breaking Norwegian wild life regulations<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationen.no/2011/10/27/rovdyr/ove_ommundsen/norsk_sau_og_geit/ulv/sau/7012801 |title=Norsk Sau og Geit er skeptisk til rovdyrtapstall for sau |last=Bårdsgård |first=Hans |work=Nationen |language=Norwegian |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Similarly there are conflicts that arise when new power lines need to be passed through the landscape.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.7689888 |title=Kampen fortsetter i Hardanger |work=NRK |language=Norwegian |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

With several of the cast being comedians that are fairly well-known to the Norwegian audience, including Otto Jespersen playing Hans, it also sets the tone of the film for many. Robert Stoltenberg playing the Polish bear hunter makes that scene less serious, and plays on facts and stereotypes that most Norwegian immigrants are from Poland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/01/10/innvbef_en/tab-2011-04-28-01-en.html |title=Immigrants and Norwegian-born to immigrant parents |publisher=Statistisk sentralbyrå |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114193503/http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/02/01/10/innvbef_en/tab-2011-04-28-01-en.html |archivedate=14 November 2011}}</ref> often speak mediocre Norwegian or English, do what they are told without asking questions<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.7876891 |title=Norskundervisning er ikke nok for å unngå arbeidsulykker |last=Evensen |first=Mari Rollag |work=NRK |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Language classes are not enough to avoid work accidents |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> and often do the work Norwegians won't do themselves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://e24.no/naeringsliv/det-eksisterer-ikke-polakkarbeid-bare-arbeid/20129588 |title=Det eksisterer ikke polakkarbeid, bare arbeid |last1=Haugsbø |first1=Frank |last2=Nervik |first2=Stein |last3=Bondø |first3=Tor-Hartvig |last4=Henriksen |first4=Thor Harald |work=E24 |language=Norwegian |trans-title=There is no such thing as Polish work, only work |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref>

==Cancelled remake==
Prior to the theatrical release of ''Trollhunter'', producers [[John M. Jacobsen]] and Sveinung Golimo had been given requests for the film to be [[Remake|remade]]. As a result, both had travelled to the United States to meet with stakeholders.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vg.no/film/artikkel.php?artid=10033209 |title="Trolljegeren"-produsent: - Man må ta troll på alvor |last=Haugen |first=Ida Anna |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |language=Norwegian |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2010}}</ref> When the film opened in the United States the following year, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' announced that director [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]' company, [[1492 Pictures]], along with [[CJ E&M|CJ Entertainment & Media]], had acquired rights to remake the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/norwegian-fright-film-troll-hunter-in-remake-deal-with-chris-columbus-1492-and-cj-entertainment |title=Norwegian Fright Film ‘Troll Hunter’ In Remake Deal With Chris Columbus’ 1492 And CJ Entertainment |last=Fleming Jr. |first=Mike |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref> [[Neil Marshall]] was to direct the remake.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2013/09/neil-marshall-set-to-rewrite-and-direct-troll-hunter-redo-591188/ |title=Neil Marshall Set To Helm ‘Troll Hunter’ Redo |last=Fleming Jr. |first=Mike |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=20 September 2013 |accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref> As of November 2016, however, the remake has been cancelled.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/troll-hunter-remake-dead |title=The ‘Troll Hunter’ Remake Is Dead |last=Giroux |first=Jack |date=10 November 2016 |work=[[/Film]] |accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/troll-hunter-remake-isnt-happening-after-all-245789 |title=That Troll Hunter remake isn’t happening after all |last=Rife |first=Katie |date=11 November 2016 |work=[[The A.V.
