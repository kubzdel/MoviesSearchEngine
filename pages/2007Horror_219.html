==Reception==
''Slasherpool'' found the film unintentionally hilarious for its poor quality and the amateurish manner of its attempt to be a serious horror film when they offered "I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. It's only unfortunate that ''Terowongan Casablanca'' wasn't intended to be funny." The reviewer panned the film as a horror, noting its sub-par sound quality, poor choices of effects, bad cinematography, bad acting, poor editing, and extreme overuse of "scary" effects, writing "they didn't have enough
money to do great special effects, so instead they
crammed countless of cheap effects in every scene", "bad editing can also be blamed for the ridiculous amount of loud scare noises
that have been crammed into every single frame of the movie", "the incompetent director and his frantic camerawork". And of the film inadvertently being a comedy, "This is the funniest horror movie I've seen in a long time but at the same time the most atrocious one in recent memory. I can't believe people are allowed to make movies this bad", and "If you're looking for a movie so bad that you won't be able to avoid laughing through the entire thing,
''Terowongan Casablanca'' is the movie for you."<ref name="SP"/>
