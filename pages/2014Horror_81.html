''[[SciFiNow]]'' wrote a mostly positive review, writing "There are one or two hiccups along the way, and the loose ends are all tied up a little too neatly to bring about the finale, but it’s a strong finish for a film that slowly finds its way under your skin. Genuinely affecting and chilling, this is an impressive and mournful debut."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hatfull|first1=Jonathan|title=FRIGHTFEST 2014 DAY 2 REVIEW: BLOOD, GHOULS AND WEREWOLVES|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/reviews/frightfest-2014-day-2-review-blood-ghouls-and-werewolves/|publisher=SciFiNow|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> The ''[[Screen Daily]]'' was also mixed in their review, stating "The haunted, empty flat – with its red walls and deep shadows – is an impressive locale, but the ghost story element is a little too ordinary to leave a lasting impression."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kim|title=The Forgotten (review)|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/the-forgotten/5076589.article|publisher=Screen Daily|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> ''Nerdly'' wrote a similar opinion, ultimately saying that the movie "is a fantastic British horror movie that, even with its flaws, should be seen by all and marks director Oliver Frampton and writer James Hall as ones to watch."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=Frightfest 2014: ‘The Forgotten’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2014/08/24/frightfest-2014-the-forgotten-review/|publisher=Nerdly|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>
