==Plot==
After witnessing California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a [[Boeing 747-400]] to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches [[Los Angeles International Airport]] (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' [[Lei (garland)|lei]]s with a special [[pheromone]] which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the [[Viperidae|viper]] that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a [[heart attack]] and continues toward LAX.

Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable [[liferaft]]. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with [[ophiology|ophiologist]] Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects the injured dealer with the antivenom and commandeers his supply of antivenom for the victims on the plane based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.

Harris contacts Flynn, telling him that antivenom will be ready for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to [[Uncontrolled decompression|depressurize]]. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game [[flight simulator]]. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and antivenom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a [[ballistic vest]]. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to [[Bali]] and teaches him how to surf.

==Development==
The story is credited to [[David Dalessandro]], a [[University of Pittsburgh]] administrator and first-time Hollywood writer. He developed the concept in 1992 after reading a nature magazine article about Indonesian [[brown tree snake]]s climbing onto planes in cargo during World War II. He originally wrote the screenplay about the brown tree snake loose on a plane, titling the film ''Venom''.<ref name="EWKickAsp" /> He soon revised it, expanding upon the premise to include a plague of assorted venomous snakes, then&mdash;crediting the film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''&mdash;revised it once again to include "lots of them loose in the [[fuselage]] of a plane."<ref name="PostScares">{{cite news|last=Hayes|first=John|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06228/713732-254.stm |title='Snakes on a Plane' scares up a following based on Hollywood's frightful track record|publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=May 11, 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080205090848/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06228/713732-254.stm |archivedate = February 5, 2008}}</ref> Dalessandro's third draft of ''Venom'' was turned down by more than 30 Hollywood studios in 1995. In 1999, a producer for [[MTV]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] showed interest in the script, followed up by New Line Studios, which took over the rights for production.

Originally, the film, under the working title "Snakes on a Plane", was going to be directed by [[Hong Kong]] action director [[Ronny Yu]].<ref name="EWKickAsp" /> Jackson, who had previously worked with Yu on ''[[The 51st State]]'', learned about the announced project in the Hollywood trade newspapers and, after talking to Yu, agreed to sign on without reading the script based on the director, storyline, and the title.<ref name="TimeSOAPTitle">{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|title=Snakes on Samuel L.

"it  was the kind of movie I would have gone to see when I was a kid"<ref name="cinemablendplane"/> further clarifying "I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of ‘Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this?’ and ‘It’s lowbrow.’ It’s a movie. People go to movies on Saturday to get away from the war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun.” <ref name="cinemablendplane"/>

The film's [[B movie|B movie-esque]] title generated a lot of pre-release interest on the Internet. One journalist wrote that ''Snakes on a Plane'' is "perhaps the most internet-hyped film of all time".<ref name="FlyingBlind">{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Mark|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1852937,00.html|title=Snakes on a Plane leaves critics flying blind|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=August 18, 2006|accessdate=May 11, 2009 | location=London}}</ref> Much of the initial publicity came from a [[blog]] entry made by screenwriter [[Josh Friedman]], who had been offered a chance to work on the script.<ref name="friedman">{{cite web|url=http://hucksblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/snakes-on-motherfucking-plane.html|title=I find your lack of faith disturbing: Snakes on a Motherfucking Plane|first=Josh|last=Friedman|date=August 17, 2005|accessdate=May 11, 2009}}</ref> The casting of Samuel L.

Taking advantage of the Internet buzz for what had been a minor film in their 2006 line-up, New Line Cinema ordered five days of additional shooting in early March 2006 ([[principal photography]] had wrapped in September 2005).<ref name="FanFrenzy">{{cite news|last=Borys |first=Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002234847 |title=Fan frenzy for 'Snakes' is on a different plane |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831173213/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002234847 |archivedate=August 31, 2006 }}</ref> While re-shoots normally imply problems with a film, the producers opted to add new scenes to the film to change the [[MPAA]] rating [[MPAA film rating system|from PG-13 to R]] and bring it in line with growing fan expectations. The most notable addition was a revision of a catchphrase from the film that was parodied on the Internet by fans of the film, capitalizing on Samuel L. Jackson's typically foul-mouthed and violent film persona: "Enough is enough!

The scenes where someone is clearly bitten were often done with animation.  According to the DVD, all the snakes had production names, but only Scarface (an animated [[pit viper]]), Peanut (a [[cobra]]), and Kong are mentioned by name in the audio commentary. During filming, Samuel Jackson did not come into contact with any live snakes, due to a contract clause preventing snakes from being within {{nowrap|8 m}} (25&nbsp;ft) of the actor.<ref name="EWKickAsp"/> When the film was released in theaters, two live [[western diamondback rattlesnake]]s were released at a showing of the film on August 22, 2006, in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].

''Snakes on a Plane'' generated considerable buzz on the Internet after Josh Friedman's blog entry<ref name="friedman" /> and mentions on several Internet portals.

===Previews===
In June 2006, New Line commissioned famed UK audio-visual film [[remix]]ers and chop-up artists [[Addictive TV]] to cut and [[Sampling (music)|sample]] ''Snakes on a Plane'' to create trailers for the U.S. television networks. The official teaser trailer premiered before ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'', and the first official trailer appeared online on June 26, 2006.<ref name="BelongSteak"/> Another trailer circulated in July 2006, showing several of the snake attacks and a missing pilot and co-pilot. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] had video clips of the official trailers, as well as fan-made trailers.<ref name="RT"/>
