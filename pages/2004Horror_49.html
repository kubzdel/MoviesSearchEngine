==Plot==
Pil-gi ([[Cha Seung-won]]) has finally saved enough money to make his late father's wish come true: He can buy his own [[house]]. However, upon moving into his new residence, he is bothered by one if its previous residents, a [[poltergeist]], who claims the house belongs to it and attempts to scare him out. Pil-gi will not give up on his dream so easily, though. He calls the police, invites friends to stay for the night, and tries [[exorcism]] rituals. None of it works. During one attack by the poltergeist he is struck by lightning and awakes in a [[hospital]]. He eventually decides it would be best to sell the house, but upon returning he discovers that he can see the [[ghost]] who has been haunting him. She reveals that her name is Yeon-hwa ([[Jang Seo-hee]]) and, now less frightened, Pil-gi talks to her and he decides to stay. However, an investor looking to build a new hotel on the site makes Pil-gi an offer to buy the house. Now it is Yeon-hwa's turn to be afraid. She begs him not to sell the house and tells him her life story. Pil-gi vows to help her keep her house.
