==Plot==
On October 31, 2013, in the small town of [[Texarkana]], the local drive-in theater is hosting the Halloween annual showing of the 1976 film ''The Town That Dreaded Sundown'', based on the true story of the Phantom Killer who murdered several people in Texarkana in 1946. Corey Holland and Jami Lerner leave the film to talk and kiss in a secluded area. The Phantom suddenly attacks them, kills Corey, and tells Jami, "This is for Mary. Make them remember." Later, two days before [[Thanksgiving]], Kendra Collins-Thompson and her boyfriend, Daniel Torrens, are killed by the Phantom while having sex at a motel. The Phantom then calls Jami with Corey's phone, telling her, "I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember." She decides to tell her police escort, Deputy Foster, about the incident. The next day, residents secure their houses and go to a town meeting.

Jami is helped with her research into the killings by her former classmate Nick Strain. At the police station, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Lone Wolf Morales takes over the investigation. Jami receives an email from the Phantom, takes it to the police, and reveals her theories about the crimes but they are disproven. Nick asks Jami out to a vigil for the Phantom victims. There, a suicidal teenager shows up dressed as the Phantom is killed, causing the townspeople to believe the murderer is actually dead. However, band members Johnny and Roy go to a lonely junkyard, where they are attacked by the real Phantom. Johnny is beaten and Roy gets tied up, whereupon the Phantom recreates the trombone weapon from the original film. Johnny is shot to death before Roy is stabbed.

Morales and Deputy Tillman visit Reverend Cartwright at his church. They discovered that he sent Jami the email, but they do not believe he is the Phantom. Meanwhile, Jami learns that [[Charles B. Pierce]]'s son is still alive and lives in [[Texarkana]]. On [[Christmas Eve]], Tillman and a woman he brought home from a bar are killed by the Phantom. Jami and Nick visit Charles Pierce Jr. and learn about Hank McCreedy, a sixth victim of the original Phantom whose story was forgotten. Pierce gives his opinion that the new Phantom is McCreedy's grandson, because the family was angered that McCreedy's death was not remembered. Jami is told that McCreedy had a wife named Mary.

Lillian, Jami's grandmother, finds out that Jami was accepted into a college in [[California]] and decides to move there so Jami can go to school. Jami tells Nick she is leaving in the morning and they have sex. After leaving, Nick is killed by the Phantom. While leaving town, Jami pulls into a gas station. There, the Phantom starts firing from a window in a nearby building, killing Lillian and several other people. Jami runs into the old Union train station and finds Nick's body. She is shot down by arrows while trying to escape. While immobile, she is confronted by two Phantom Killers. One is Deputy Foster and the other is Corey, who faked his death. Foster reveals that he is McCreedy's grandson. Corey tries to convince Jami they are the same--- that Texarkana trapped them in roles in society that they hated--- but she adamantly rejects his claim. Corey goes on to brag about how everyone will know what he did, and decides to kill her for this,  but is then shot and killed by Foster who plans to kill Jami as well and blame the killings on her and Corey. While Foster is attacking Jami, she finds the gun and shoots Foster, but it is stated that his body was never found. Jami moves on with her life and goes to college. In the end, the Phantom's shadow is seen stalking Jami.

When [[Jason Blum]] was asked in an interview why he wanted to remake the original film, he responded:
<blockquote>[[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] found the movie, brought it to me and said, "I wanna do it". I didn't find it. He brought it to me. I think he is an amazing, creative force, especially with horror. I think he thinks about horror in a really unique way. So, he pitched it to me and I really wanted to work with him. I didn't know the [original] movie. That's what got me interested in it. I have had a really good working relationship with him. And the whole point of why my business exists and why I'm such a fanatic about making movies inexpensively is that you get to do different stuff. We just wanted to try it. That's the fun thing. When you don't have a $20 million horror film, which is a typical horror movie studio budget, or a $180 million tent-pole budget, looming down at you, you can try new stuff. It may work or it may not work, but the fun is that we can try. It's a really weird movie to remake, and I really like doing weird things.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/jason-blum-the-purge-interview |title=Jason Blum Talks THE PURGE and The Town That Dreaded Sundown Remake |publisher=Collider |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref></blockquote>

Three of those days were filmed in Texarkana.
