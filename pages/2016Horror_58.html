Demon hunter Jebediah Woodley travels to a town in southern Mississippi, with the hopes of burying an ancient but undestroyable demon.

The scripted film took place in [[Alaska]], and had a "''[[30 Days of Night (film)|30 Days of Night]]'' [and] ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' feel" to it. But according to Mendez, when ''Don't Kill It'' was [[Green-light|green-lit]], it was a case of: "great, we're shooting in [[Mississippi]]". Due to the small budget, Mendez knew they weren't "going to cover the town in snow and pretend it's Alaska", so he had to adapt "very quickly" to the situation at hand.<ref name=AndersonD/> In order for them to create the "final elements", producer Scott Martin raised over $15,000 for the film via [[Indiegogo]]; his initial aim was to raise $100,000 through [[crowdfunding]].<ref name=IGogo>Martin, Scott.

===Casting===
[[File:Lundgren2015.png|thumb|250px|Dolph Lundgren in 2015, around the time of being cast as Jebediah Woodley.]]
[[Dolph Lundgren]] was cast in the lead role of Jebediah Woodley; he found out about the role "probably" 9-10 months before shooting began on the film.  He rehearsed different pages of dialogue and monologues in a short space of time, but claims to have "had it all down"; as production was postponed on two occasions, which caused the character to grow on him with time. On his character, Lundgren said: "Jebediah Woodley is one of those guys that when I’m sitting in my rocking chair one day, thinking back, I’ll remember that guy. He was a fun guy to play."<ref name=AndersonD/>

[[Kristina Klebe]] portrays FBI Agent Evelyn Pierce. Just before [[Thanksgiving]] and "maybe a week or two" before shooting began, Mendez gave her a call and said he would send her the script. Despite working with Mendez on ''[[Tales of Halloween]]'' (in 2015) and ''The Last Heist'' (the following year), Klebe still had to "put herself on tape" because they were auditioning a few people. She didn't hear anything back until four days before filming; at which point she was cast. This was due to all of the producers disagreeing on who they wanted to play the role.<ref name=Buckley>Buckley, Heather. [https://diaboliquemagazine.com/dont-kill-2016-interview-kristina-klebe/ "Don’t Kill It (2016): Interview with Kristina Klebe"], ''Diabolique Magazine'', published March 9, 2017. Retrieved June 30, 2017.</ref> On Klebe's performance, Lundgren said: she "plays her character pretty straight", which worked "quite well" in retrospect due to Woodley's "crazy and colorful" nature. He went on to say: "Kristina really loved the part, so she was very accommodating and willing to explore it and work hard."<ref name=AndersonD/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] took 17 days in [[Canton, Mississippi]], over the 2015 [[Christmas]] season. Although credits at end of movie day it was filmed in Lexington MS. Many shots do show the Holmes County courthouse located in a Lexington. <ref name=AndersonD/><ref name=WBain>Bain, Whitney Scott.

Mendez claims the "town [used for filming] had never had a movie shot" there before, and went on to say: "it's actually one of the poorest suburbs in America, to be honest". Apparently, the city and public were very interested in the movie's production and the presence of Dolph Lundgren within their community. Furthermore, the local authorities were helpful; and provided the production crew with access to different locations; including the local church, as well as "police cars [to shut down] streets for filming."<ref name=AndersonD/>

''Don't Kill It'' reportedly premiered to "rave" reviews at many major film festivals around the world.<ref name=HNewsStaff>Staff.

Retrieved July 2, 2017.</ref> Richard Whittaker of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' attended the US premiere in Austin, Texas. In a positive review, he described "this horror-comedy [as a] gutbuster [of] belly laughs". Unlike Lundgren's other movies, ''Don't Kill It'' "revels in his dry yet goofy sense of humor, rather than the taciturn killer he was born to play". Lundgren was the component Mendez "really needed"; "perfectly" self-aware; his "perfect muse/foil for his brand of smartly/silly horror spoof".<ref name=RWhittaker>Whittaker, Richard.

Retrieved July 2, 2017.</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]]'s Trace Thurman came to the same conclusion, stating: there's "plenty of tongue in cheek" in which "Dolph Lundgren [is given] a chance to shine". According to him, ''Don't Kill It'' "plays like a [[B-movie]] version of ''Fallen'', but without the class of that latter film; that’s a compliment. Who knew that Lundgren was such a comedian? There were some moments in the film that had to have been improvised, and they’re such treats to watch". Unfortunately, the film "peaks early" with the church shootout. The scene is "so fantastically entertaining that nothing that comes after it is able to measure up to it." Contrarily, Thurman took aim at Klebe, stating: "[she] is serviceable as Pierce but she is stuck playing the Felix Ungar to Lundgren’s Oscar Madison. Woodley needs a foil but Pierce spends the first half of the film being a stick in the mud. One wishes that she was given more to do."<ref name=ThurmanT>Thurman, Trace.

Noel Murray of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', called the film one of Lundgren's "most entertaining movies in years." He praised screenwriters Dan Berk and Robert Olsen for their "clever story about a supernatural force that turns its human hosts mindlessly homicidal". On the contrary, he criticized Mike Mendez for his editing, claiming "his many, many set-up scenes are to clunky", but on a positive note gave him praise for the fast pace and "lightness" of the film.<ref name=NoelMurray>Murray, Noel.

Hayleigh Foutch of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] said the film "is a cheeky camp parade with buckets of low-rent charm, and for fans of camp cinema and Lundgren's B-Movie fare, ''Don't Kill It'' will fit like slipping into something cozy and familiar with a few surprises along the way." Agreeing with Donato, she said: Lundgren "rarely gets to have so much fun" in his movies. And like others, she spoke of the "lull [in the] second act", during which time the movie falls into "exposition and back story".<ref name=Foutch/> Michael Nordine of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' gave a somewhat negative review, stating: [Lundgren] seems to hover just above the material, aware of its silliness but willing the indulge it all the same. Those who favor gore above all else will be at home amid the blood and guts, but anyone hoping for more than a VOD time-killer that’s occasionally in on the joke of its own ridiculousness is barking up the wrong tree."<ref name=MNordine>Nordine, Michael.

==Potential sequel==
Lundgren said he'd be open to returning for a sequel, but hopes any potential sequel will have better planning and "more resources" at hand. On a similar note, Mendez said: "People are reacting to the film so much, and what we constantly hear is, 'Will there be another one?' What more could you ask for? We're finding [Jebediah] at a moment in time. There have been adventures before and there will be adventures afterwards, so I'm hoping we'll find a financial partner that wants to explore that and take that ride, because we'd love to explore that, too."<ref name=AndersonD/>
