A sequel, ''[[The Conjuring 2]]'', was released on June 10, 2016, with a third film currently in development.

==Plot==
In 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a dilapidated farmhouse in [[Harrisville, Rhode Island]], with their five daughters Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog Sadie refuses to enter the house and one of the children, while playing a game of "hide and clap", finds a boarded-up entrance to a cellar.

Paranormal events occur within the first few nights: all of the clocks stop at exactly 3:07 AM and Sadie is found dead in the backyard. One night in bed, Christine encounters a malevolent spirit only she can see, prompting her to claim that the spirit wants her family dead. Another night, Carolyn hears clapping in the hallway. When she goes to investigate, following the noises, she gets trapped in the basement by the spirit. At the same moment, Andrea and Cindy are attacked by the spirit on top of the wardrobe.

Carolyn decides to contact [[demonologist]]s [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]], who have recently investigated a possessed doll called [[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle]]. The Warrens agree to take on the case, conduct an initial investigation and conclude that the house may require an exorcism, but they need authorization from the Catholic Church and further evidence before they can proceed. Ed and Lorraine discover that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba (a relative of [[Mary Eastey|Mary Towne Eastey]]), who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land. They find reports of numerous murders and suicides in houses that had since been built on the property.

To gather evidence, Ed and Lorraine place cameras and bells around the house. They see Cindy sleepwalking into Andrea's room, and from the [[Electronic voice phenomenon|EVPs]] coming from the radio, they hear a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage inside. Lorraine enters the passage and falls through the floorboards to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had long ago possessed and used to kill her child. The Perron family decides to take refuge at a motel while Ed and Lorraine take their evidence to the Church. The Warrens' daughter Judy is attacked in their own home by Bathsheba, though Ed arrives in time to save her. Carolyn, now possessed by Bathsheba, takes Christine and April back to the house. Ed and Lorraine find Carolyn in the cellar trying to stab Christine. After tying Carolyn to a chair, Ed decides that an exorcism needs to be performed on Carolyn, but realizes there isn't enough time to wait for a priest to arrive. Ed decides to perform the exorcism himself, and in the process is attacked by Bathsheba. Though Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April, Lorraine is able to distract Carolyn from killing her daughter by reminding her of a special memory she shared with her family, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism, saving Carolyn and April and lifting Bathsheba's curse forever.

Returning home, Lorraine tells Ed that they had been left a message saying that they had gained approval from the Catholic Church to perform the exorcism. They also have [[The Amityville Horror|another case to investigate on Long Island]]. Before leaving, Ed adds a music box from the Perrons' house to a collection of items he and Lorraine have saved from past cases. It inexplicably opens and plays music until the screen cuts to black.

==Production==

===Development===
Producer Tony DeRosa-Grund wrote the original treatment and titled the project ''The Conjuring''.<ref name="DL">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2013/06/whats-in-a-title-the-conjuring-producer-new-line-head-to-arbitration-over-tv-rights/|title=What's In A Title?

He landed a deal to make the movie at [[Gold Circle Films]], the production company behind ''[[The Haunting in Connecticut]]'', but a contract could not be finalized and the deal was dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardianlv.com/2013/07/james-wan-the-conjuring-a-remake/|title=James Wan The Conjuring a Remake?|website=Guardian Liberty Voice|first=Michael|last=Smith|date=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

DeRosa-Grund allied with producer [[Peter Safran]], and sibling writers [[Chad Hayes (writer)|Chad]] and [[Carey Hayes]] were brought on board to refine the script.<ref name=DL/> Using DeRosa-Grund's treatment and the Ed Warren tape, the Hayes brothers changed the story's [[Narrative mode|point of view]] from the Perron family to the Warrens'.

DeRosa-Grund reconnected with [[New Line Cinema]], who had lost in the original bidding war but who ultimately picked up the film. On November 11, 2009, a deal was made between New Line and DeRosa-Grund's Evergreen Media Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/new-line-claims-conjuring-partner-574065|title=New Line Claims 'Conjuring' Partner Committed Trademark Fraud|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Eriq|last=Gardner|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>

Pre-production began in early 2011, with reports surfacing in early June that [[James Wan]] was in talks to direct the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=James Wan Could Perform the Conjuring|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/45175/james-wan-could-perform-conjuring|website=Dread Central|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref> This was later confirmed by [[Warner Bros.]], which also stated that the film would be loosely based on real-life events surrounding Ed and Lorraine Warren.

==Music==
The [[Film score|musical score]] for ''The Conjuring'' was composed by Joseph Bishara, who previously collaborated with director Wan on ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2011). "James asked me early on about [''The Conjuring''] while the film was still coming together", explained Bishara on his involvement. "The studio and producers were very supportive in allowing him to bring along who he wanted, with many of his longtime crew from ''Insidious'' and even earlier returning."<ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Todd|title=Film Music Friday: Joseph Bishara on The Conjuring|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2013/07/wecreatemusic/fmf-joseph-bishara-on-the-conjuring.aspx|website=[[ASCAP]]|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}</ref> Further into the development process, Wan offered Bishara the chance to act in the film, which he had previously done in ''Insidious''. "We talked about music first and then James had mentioned that he might want me to play one of the entities in this. After reading the script it turned out it was Bathsheba," said Bishara.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ken|last=Nelson|title=Interview With THE CONJURING's Jack-Of-All-Trades Joseph Bishara -Part 1|url=http://www.geekroom.com/horror/interview-with-the-conjurings-jack-of-all-trades-joseph-bishara-part-1/#.Ue2mBVOvxIt|website=Geek Room|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}</ref> Because of his early involvement, Bishara was given more time to work out the musical palette of the film. "For whatever reason I was hearing brass clustering as an early response to the material, a quiet shimmering flutter tongue effect, and it grew from there", said Bishara on his creative process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to THE CONJURING Out 7/16|url=http://movies.broadwayworld.com/article/Original-Motion-Picture-Sountrack-to-THE-CONJURING-Out-716-20130711|website=Broadway World|date=July 11, 2013|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>

A soundtrack album was released by [[La-La Land Records]] and [[WaterTower Music]] on July 16, 2013. In addition to Bishara's themes, the soundtrack also includes a track titled "Family Theme" by composer [[Mark Isham]].<ref>{{cite web|title='The Conjuring' Soundtrack Details|url=http://www.filmmusicreporter.com/2013/06/19/the-conjuring-soundtrack-details/|website=Film Music Reporter|date=June 19, 2013|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> [[Avant-garde]] musician [[Diamanda Galás]] also contributed to Bishara's score,<ref name="HR">{{cite web|first=Sheri|last=Linden|title=The Conjuring: LAFF Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/conjuring/review/573656|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref> performing raw vocal improvisation on top of the previously recorded brass instrumentation.<ref name="ASCAP"/> Other songs featured in the film include: "In the Room Where you Sleep" by [[Dead Man's Bones]], "[[Sleep Walk]]" by Betsy Brye, "[[Time of the Season]]" by [[The Zombies]], and  "Wish I May" by [[Breaking Benjamin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conjuring – Song Credits|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/the-conjuring/|website=[[Soundtrack.net]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

''The Conjuring'' was released in [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] formats by [[Warner Home Video|Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]] on October 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conjuring Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=12131|website=Blu-ray.com|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>

==Lawsuits==
Norma Sutcliffe and Gerald Helfrich, the current owners of the house on which the film was based, are suing James Wan, Warner Bros. and other producers, on the ground that their property is being vandalized constantly as a consequence of the film. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' obtained documents in which the owners affirm various invasions and ratify that they have found numerous objects affiliated with satanic cults. The lawsuit also reveals that the current owners bought the house in 1987 and lived "in peace" until 2012. Both owners are seeking unspecified damages. When questioned, a spokesperson for Warner Bros. declined to comment on the issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/05/the-conjuring-house-lawsuit/|title=Owners of The Conjuring house sue Warner Bros. over trespassing fans|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Oliver|last=Gettell|date=October 5, 2015}}</ref>

Gerald Brittle, author of the 1980 book ''The Demonologist'' about Ed and Lorraine Warren, filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros., New Line Productions and director James Wan regarding the film. Brittle claims the film, alongside the subsequent sequel and spin offs, infringe upon an exclusive contract he had with the Warrens to make any works based on the subject of his book. The film rights were briefly with original publisher Prentice Hall before reverting to Brittle. Warner Bros. has refused to comment on the case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/warner-bros-facing-900-million-lawsuit-conjuring-franchise-990107|title=Warner Bros.

The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an 86% approval rating, based on 207 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Well-crafted and gleefully creepy, ''The Conjuring'' ratchets up dread through a series of effective old-school scares."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conjuring (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_conjuring/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] assigned the film a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref name="Metacritic">{{cite web|title=The Conjuring Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-conjuring|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave the film an "A-" grade on a scale of A to F.<ref>{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Finke|title=#1 'The Conjuring' Scares Up $40M Weekend & Rare 'A' CinemaScore, Other New Films Soft Or Sinking: 'Red 2', 'Turbo', 'R.I.P.D.'|url=http://deadline.com/2013/07/the-conjuring-big-1-with-a-cinemascore-but-every-other-new-film-soft-or-sinking/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=July 19, 2013|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

In her review following the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]], Sheri Linden of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "With its minimal use of digital effects, its strong, sympathetic performances and ace design work, the pic harks back in themes and methods to ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'', not quite attaining the poignancy and depth of the former but far exceeding the latter in sheer cinematic beauty."<ref name="HR"/> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling the film "a sensationally entertaining old-school freakout and one of the smartest, most viscerally effective thrillers in recent memory."<ref>{{cite web|first=Justin|last=Chang|title=Film Review: 'The Conjuring'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-the-conjuring-1200500864/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, [[Alonso Duralde]] of [[TheWrap]] also praised the effectiveness of the film, explaining that it "doesn't try to reinvent the tropes of horror movies, whether it's ghosts or demons or exorcisms, but [[Fred Astaire]] didn't invent tap-dancing, either."<ref>{{cite web|first=Alonso|last=Duralde|title='The Conjuring' Review: No, Seriously, Do NOT Go in the Basement|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/conjuring-review-no-seriously-do-not-go-basement-99116|website=[[TheWrap]]|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an A-, citing the effectiveness of "mood and sound effects for shocks that never feel cheap."<ref>{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|title=The Conjuring Movie Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20687817,00.html|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}</ref>
