'''''Final Draft''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] directed by Jonathan Dueck.

== Plot ==
Paul (James Van Der Beek) is a script writer with a big problem: he only has 18 days to release his last script. A script that could be his chance to be someone well-knowing. He decides to lock his home and to live isolated until the job is done. But the main character of his story is a maniac clown, and something happens...the line between fantasy and reality is so thin, Paul is going crazy.
