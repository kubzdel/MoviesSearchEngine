The film has received negative reviews. Tom Becker of the [[DVD Verdict]] said, "The film is guilty of being a bloody bore. The accused are sentenced to stand in front of a mirror chanting, "I believe in [[Ed Wood]]," until they learn that bad movies can be entertaining, too".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Tom|title=DVD Verdict Review - The Legend Of Bloody Mary|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/legendbloodymary.php|website=DVD Verdict.com|publisher=Tom Becker|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> ''Eat Horror'' panned the film stating, "This is a muddled story with plot holes aplenty and terrible acting even by low budget horror standards. The direction is all over the place with too many hand-held shots and the meager effects are cheap and terrible. You would think the Bloody Mary story would eventually spawn a decent horror film but this isn't it".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Legend of Bloody Mary|url=http://www.moviesmademe.com/movie/review/1899|website=EatHorror.com|publisher=EatHorror|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref> ''Home Theater Info'' rated B+ giving 7 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Legend of Bloody Mary|url=http://www.hometheaterinfo.com/the_legend_of_bloody_mary.htm|website=hometheaterinfo.com|publisher=HomeTheaterInfo.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>
