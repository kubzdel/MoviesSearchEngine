==Plot==
Mallory (Julianne Hough) is a young bride-to-be on her way to Denver for her wedding rehearsal. She video chats with her sister, Ella (Penelope Mitchell), on her way there. Ella tells her that she hasn't bought her plane tickets yet because she wants to make sure Mallory is actually in love and happy with her decisions. Mallory responds by telling her she's happy in a fake voice. She hangs up with her sister and continues driving. A few minutes later, her car breaks down unexpectedly. She tries calling [[American Automobile Association|AAA]], but she has no service. She also tries doing some tricks under the hood of the car, but to no avail.

While Mallory tries changing her clothes near the back of the car, she spots a man, Christian (Teddy Sears). She quickly puts on a tank top and tells him her situation. He eventually gets her car started for her. She then says she would offer him a ride, but was in a rush. She starts to drive away but, out of guilt, stops and offers him a ride.

Along the way, he starts acting odd. He talks about how fate brought them together and how it was supposed to happen like this, assuring her that he is not flirting. He then tells her how she couldn't "deepthroat his huge cock". She then stops and tells him to get out. He pulls out a knife and tells her to drive.

She notices his seat belt is off and tries to kill him by speeding towards a guardrail near a curve. They crash violently. Mallory wakes up to find the car upside down. She unhooks her seat belt, but she can't get out. She notices her leg is caught and pinned between the seat, all bloody. She tries pushing out, but fails. Christian slowly wakes up and tells her she needs to get herself out of this one and leaves her. She tries honking her horn and screaming for help but no one can hear her.

Mallory slips on a hoodie and drinks the last bit of her water bottle. The following morning Christian comes back and eats and drinks in front of her. He tells her how this was supposed to happen and how fate is a funny thing. That night a bunch of rats come in and slather around her. She kills one of them and eats a strip of its meat and drinks her own urine. Christian comes back and tells her how he's holding a family hostage. He then gives her a saw. At first Mallory thinks he gave it to her to cut through the seat, but he tells her he doesn't expect it to and how if she doesn't cut off her leg she's going to die.

That night a huge rainstorm hits and Christian comes to say his goodbyes but she attacks him and throws his car keys outside to where he can't find them. A police car pulls up from the curve, he runs and tells the officer his car won't start. The officer tells him he'll give him a ride but hears Mallory's scream. The officer thinks he's imagining things and drives away with Christian.

As the car starts to flood, Mallory starts trying to cut her leg off, but barely makes a few superficial cuts before her leg comes free out of the seat due to the assistance of the flood. She makes it out and goes to the cabin where Christian says he was at. She witnesses him killing the police officer and sees he has killed the home owners, while keeping the daughter, Katie, hostage. She aims a gun she found and tells him if he moves, she shoots. He attacks Mallory as Katie runs out the front door. Mallory twists his nose and elbows his stomach before running. She hides under a table, he finds her and she gets up and runs. He smashes her into a mirror but she manages to keep him down on the ground long enough for her to run upstairs. Christian looks for her upstairs, but Mallory sneaks from behind a dresser, creeps behind him and pushes him off of a second-story balcony and he falls and crushes his leg into a bear trap. She limps downstairs and gives him his knife and tells him how fate really brought this together and she's going to give him the same chance that he gave her. Christian soon succumbs to his wound and dies. The final scene shows Mallory limping down the road with Katie as the front door of the house slams shut.
