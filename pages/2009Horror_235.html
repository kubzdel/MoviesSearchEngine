The sequel to ''[[Wrong Turn 2: Dead End]]'' (2007) and the third installment in the [[Wrong Turn (film series)|''Wrong Turn'' film series]] and the first film in the series to be released on [[direct-to-video]].

== Plot ==
Alex Miles and her friends Trey, Sophie and Brent go into the woods of West Virginia on a rafting trip. As they are camping, Sophie takes off her bra telling her that "the girls need to breathe" when her boyfriend Brent arrives and starts gently fondling her supple breasts, and Alex leaves to find Trey. Just as the two were going to get intimate, Three Fingers' arrow pierces Sophie's left boob right through Brent's right hand and the other arrow pierces Sophie's eye, while Brent flees leaving Sophie for dead. Alex who had not gotten far is aghast as Three Finger eats Sophie's eye raw. Trey sees this and runs for his life but falls down and is brutally killed by Three Finger. Brent has not gotten far as he trips a tight wire trap and is sliced in three like an egg. Sheriff Carver and Deputy Lane receive a report about the missing group.

Two days later, prison guard Nate is assigned with Walter and Preslow to transfer a group of prisoners to a distant prison. The prisoners are Crawford, a car thief; Floyd, a [[neo-Nazi]] serial killer; Brandon, who claims he was wrongly convicted of murder; Chavez, the leader of a crime organization; and Willy, an undercover agent who is posing as a prisoner to get information from Chavez. While driving, their bus is rammed by Three Finger's truck and crashes in the woods of West Virginia, forcing them to continue on foot. Walter is badly injured, but Nate rescues him from the truck before it explodes.

They follow Alex, and on the way, find an abandoned armored truck. Chavez tells Nate to check the cab of the truck. Nate finds a set of keys and a gun. He secretly gives the gun to Walter, after handing the keys over to Chavez. Chavez uses the keys to open the back of the truck, and finds several bags of money. He intends to steal the money and demands that everyone carry two bags, but Walter refuses because of his injury. In a last-ditch effort to regain control of the situation, Walter pulls out the gun and tries to shoot Chavez. Unfortunately, the gun is not loaded and Chavez shoots and kills Walter. Chavez forces those left alive to carry the money and they continue on foot.

Along the trail, they stumble upon a trap, set by Three Toes, Three Finger's son. They escape then catch the son and behead him, leaving a trophy on the spent booby trap for Three Finger to find as a deterrent. This enrages Three Finger, who sets traps for the group, killing first Willy, then Crawford.

Meanwhile, Sheriff Carver looks for Nate, and Deputy Lane sets out look for the missing group of rafters. Sheriff Carver finds the group but is killed by Three Finger. Chavez and Floyd get into a fist fight while Brandon watches, allowing Nate and Alex to escape. After the fight, Chavez and Brandon leave the knocked out Floyd behind. When they hear Alex and Nate talking, they lay the money down before taking them hostage again. They find the location where the [[Wrong Turn|watch tower once stood, only to discover it was burned down years ago]]. Floyd finds the money and attempts to run away with it, but he stumbles on some rocks and cries out. Chavez hears him and finds Floyd, only to see Three Finger lobbing a molotov cocktail at Floyd, killing him and burning all the money. Chavez gives Alex to Three Finger to improve his chances of survival. Three Finger drags Alex into his truck and drives off. He secures Alex at his house and goes back out to hunt the rest of the survivors. Nate wants to go after Alex, but Chavez threatens to kill him if he does. Fed up, Brandon knocks Chavez unconscious and lets Nate go. After waking up, Chavez finds Three Finger and fights him, but Three Finger overpowers and kills him.

Alex awakens in Three Finger's house and sees Deputy Lane die in a razor wire net. Nate finds Three Finger's house and frees Alex, but Three Finger attacks him. Alex saves him by stabbing Three Finger. Nate and Alex drive away in his tow truck, but Three Finger follows them, leaps on top of the truck, and causes them to crash into a tree. As the truck catches fire, Brandon appears and pulls Alex out. While Brandon helps Nate, Three Finger attacks them, but Nate apparently kills him with a meathook. Afterwards, a U.S. Marshal team arrives and rescues Nate and Alex.

Sometime later, Nate greedily returns to take the remaining money from the armored truck. Karma takes its toll and Brandon appears from nowhere and betrays him, shooting him in the back with an arrow. While Brandon takes the money, an unknown cannibal appears and brutally bludgeons him to death with a crude club.
