Sam Suchmann and Mattie Zufelt, both of whom have [[Down syndrome]], met at the [[Special Olympics]].  Sam's older brother, Jesse, said their families initially viewed the friends' enthusiasm for a film as a phase the two would eventually outgrow.  When they did not, Jesse investigated further, finding that they had written a notebook full of scenes, including storyboards.<ref name=cbs>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-friends-zombie-movie-gives-audiences-something-to-smile-about/?google_editors_picks=true|title=Best friends' zombie movie gives audiences something to smile about|last=Hartman|first=Steve|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2016-10-28|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>  Jesse initially considered shooting the film do-it-yourself style but was impressed enough with their work that he took the film to [[Kickstarter]], where it received $68,000 in funding.<ref name=pbs>{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/turn-reporter-zombie/|title=How this NewsHour reporter became a zombie|last=Melia|first=Mike|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]|date=2015-08-27|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>  Taking the position of producer, Jesse brought in director Bobby Carnevale, whom he had been friends with in high school.<ref name=pj>{{cite news|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160713/ri-friends-with-down-syndrome-premiere-their-epic-zombie-movie|title=RI friends with Down syndrome premiere their epic zombie movie|last=McDermott|first=Jennifer|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2016-07-13|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>  Filming took place over 16 days in Providence, Rhode Island.
