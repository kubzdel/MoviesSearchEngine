'''''K3: Prison of Hell''''' is a 2009 [[Pornographic film|pornographic]] [[horror film]] written and directed [[Andreas Bethmann]]. It is a spin-off of the 2004 film ''Notgeile Knastjulen zur Unzucht erzogen'', and its 2005 sequel.

== Plot ==

In the jungle surrounding K3 Women's Jail, an escapee searches for her two companions, one of whom is being beaten by a guard. Via narration, the woman explains that she is Jennifer Walters, the [[psychologist]] of the jail, which she has been a prisoner of for five years. Jennifer states that this story begins four weeks ago, with the arrival of two new inmates, Anne and Suzanne.

Anne is introduced being hosed down and made to strip by the female warden, while Suzanne is forced at gunpoint to have sex with Sub Warden Stevie in the exam room, where all new prisoners are "broken in". Anne is placed in a cell, while Suzanne is left in the exam room with a deranged woman. One night, Jennifer happens upon the senior [[physician]], Doctor Bertucci, torturing one of the inmates. Bertucci has stripped the woman and tied her to a bed, and he has her perform [[fellatio]] on him in exchange for the antidote to a poison he has injected into her vagina.

One morning, the warden watches as Bertucci has a prisoner give him a blowjob, then moves on to another one of her employees who is burying body parts. The warden seduces the man, while Bertucci ties his victim up, and [[Flagellation|whips]] her until he grows bored. Back in the jail, Bertucci has his way with the crazy woman, something which Jennifer overhears.

As Jennifer is raped by Stevie in the kitchen, the warden coerces Anne into having sex with her in the showers, having decided to take the woman as her [[Sexual slavery|sex slave]]. Later, Jennifer confronts Bertucci about his unethical actions, but he dismisses her comments, so she meets with the warden. Annoyed by the complaints, the warden has Jennifer undress at gunpoint, and she masturbates as Stevie whips Jennifer in front of her.

One day, the warden places a virgin prisoner in [[stocks]], and forces Jennifer to watch as she violently [[Fisting|fists]] the woman, causing her to bleed. Suzanne is raped in her cell by a guard named Arnie, and the mentally ill inmate is tied up and tortured by Bertucci and the warden, who mutilate her feet with a knife, and [[Wax play|hot wax]]. Suzanne is shackled, and is raped and whipped by Stevie and Arnie as Bertucci films it. Arnie then takes the nude Suzanne out to the jungle, and after molesting her, leaves her to die.

Bertucci and the warden return to the crazy prisoner, and after using a [[sex-machine]] on her, fatally electrocute her with wires attached to her nipples. Having overheard what has been done to Suzanne, Jennifer decides to try and save her, sneaking out of K3 by stealing a set of keys, and a guard's uniform. Out in the jungle, Anne is being used as a table by the lunching warden, and tries to make a run for it, just as Suzanne breaks free of the stakes she was bound to. After a chase, both women are recaptured, Suzanne by Arnie, and Anne by the warden, who wounds Anne by stabbing her in the head.

Anne is brought back to K3, and convinced that she was in on Jennifer's disappearance, Bertucci and the warden leave her to be interrogated and mutilated by Pete [[Edward Scissorhands|Scissorhands]], something which Anne's cellmate is forced to watch. Pete eventually slits Anne's throat, after cutting open her breasts, stabbing and breaking her leg, and ripping one of her nipples off. Outside, Jennifer discovers Suzanne tied to a tree, and is caught by Stevie. Arnie shoots Suzanne's head off, and Jennifer is shot to death by Stevie.

Inside, Anne's cellmate weeps as Pete cuts Anne's body open, and gnaws on her intestines. The warden observes this, and dispassionately comments, "What are you doing? You've already had dinner!"

== Reception ==

The Sins of Cinema called ''K3'' "easily one of the nastiest films I have seen" and "100% pure [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] gold" that warranted a score of nine out of ten.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://sinsofcinema.com/Reviews/K3-Prison-of-Hell-Review.php|title = ''K3: Prison of Hell'' Review|last = Parton|first = Chip|publisher = The Sins of Cinema|date = |website = sinsofcinema.com|accessdate = 17 August 2013}}</ref> The gore was praised by Independent Flicks, which stated that it was "a very nasty and disturbing film" that looked good considering its budget, though the bad acting, weak plot, and lack of worthwhile characters made it somewhat boring.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.ca/2011/11/dvd-review-k3-prison-of-hell-video-2009.html|title = DVD Review: ''K3: Prison of Hell'' (Video 2009)|last = Lunden|first = Jorgen|publisher = Independent Flicks|date = 13 November 2011|website = daydreamer-theplayground.blogspot.ca|accessdate = 17 August 2013}}</ref>

The effects of [[Olaf Ittenbach]] were commended by [[HorrorNews.net]], which felt that ''K3'' was "weighed down in repetitive acts" and was a "filthy production" with no purpose or agenda outside of being exploitative.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://horrornews.net/46720/film-review-k3-prison-of-hell-2009/|title = Film Review: ''K3 Prison of Hell'' (2009)|last = |first = |publisher = Horror News|date = 15 January 2012|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 17 August 2013}}</ref> The film was deemed worthless by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which called it almost completely plotless, and "tiringly repetitive".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://thelastexit.net/cinema/bethmann.html#K3_-_Prison_of_Hell|title = Andreas Bethmann|last = |first = |publisher = The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre|date = |website = thelastexit.net|accessdate = 17 August 2013}}</ref>
