==Plot==
A guide and a tourist are birdwatching in the shades of Camp Blackwood. They are suddenly attacked by a man wearing a boiler suit and clown mask with a [[machete]]. Two hunters come and discover the guide still alive. The clown then appears and murders all of them. 

The story then focuses on four campers, who are planning a trip to Camp Blackwood. On the way, they meet the madcap Bromley Thatcher. After a brief exchange that includes a warning from Thatcher - "I'm not talking about a ghost here boy, I'm talking about a man, a REAL man, and he's in those woods!" - the group head into Camp Blackwood, now known to the audience as 'Camp Blood'.

In the woods, they meet their guide, a butch lesbian known as 'Harris'. After spending the day doing menial tasks such as collecting firewood and setting up camp, the group settle down into their respective tents to enjoy a session of late-night love making. The group awake in the morning to find the burnt-out carcass of Harris on the campfire (apparently murdered by the killer clown). The majority of the plot then revolves around the clown chasing the various characters through the woods and brutally murdering all of them but Tricia, who manages to run away from the clown.

In attempting to escape the murderous clown, Tricia runs to her deceased boyfriend's automobile. At this point, she meets Thatcher, who attempts to aid the clown by hindering Tricia's escape. In the ensuing melee, Tricia hacks Thatcher to death with the clown's machete, and enters the car and runs over the clown, who is revealed to be Harris. Just as Tricia is driving away safely, the clown appears in the back seat and strangles Tricia into unconsciousness.

When Tricia regains consciousness, she is in a mental asylum. After giving Tricia an injection, the 'doctors' depart from the room. It is at this point that Tricia hallucinates the clown entering the room.

==Cast==
* Jennifer Ritchkoff - Tricia Young
* Michael Taylor - Steven Jessup/Doctor West
* [[Tim Young (actor)|Tim Young]] - Jason Helman/Detective Hamlin
* Bethany Zolt - Nicole Starry/Nurse
* Courtney Taylor - Harris Stanley
* Joseph Haggerty - Bromley Thatcher
* Merideth O'Brien - Sally Brennan
* Vinnie Bilancio - Victor Konenkamp
* Ron Ford - Gus Franco
* Tim Sullivan - George Guffy
* Ivonne Armant - Mary Lou Maloney
* Randy Rice - Nathan Cobb (Mary Lou's Lover)
* Shemp Moseley - The Clown

Ivonne Armant's character shares a name with the ghostly slasher Mary Lou Maloney from ''[[Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II]]'' (1987) and ''[[Prom Night III: The Last Kiss]]'' (1990). However, since Armant's character seems strictly mortal in nature, it is presumed that the two characters are not meant to be one and the same.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Digital Retribution gave the film a mixed score of 3 out of five, writing, "Given the title and the Ralph knockoff, Camp Blood was obviously made by fans who wanted to do their own version of Friday the 13th. I don't mind that, but unfortunately the film is done well for the budget, leaving only the script and gore as a marvel of bad filmmaking. The end result is a fairly typical slasher, when a movie about a killer in a silly clown mask could've been so much more. Just watch the trailer, it's a lot funnier than the actual movie."<ref name="dreview">{{cite web|last1=B.|first1=Devon|title=Camp Blood DVD Review|url=http://www.digital-retribution.com/reviews/dvd/0282.php|website=Digital Retribution.com|publisher=Devon B.|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> [[Something Awful]] heavily panned the film, stating that "If you're an aspiring horror director and you want to see a moving list of things not to do, this movie is for you."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.somethingawful.com/movie-reviews/camp-blood/1/|title=Review - Camp Blood|last=Wade|first=Evan|date=December 13, 2005|work=Something Awful|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>

== Sequels ==
Sykes quickly followed up his 1999 release of ''Camp Blood'' with a sequel, ''[[Camp Blood 2]],'' in October 2000. A third unofficial film, ''Within the Woods'', was released five years after that, in 2005. Sykes wrote and directed both sequels and actress Jennifer Ritchkoff reprised her role as Tricia Young for ''Camp Blood 2'', but did not return for the third film. 

The fourth sequel was released at the beginning 2014 with ''Camp Blood: First Slaughter'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3297813/dvd-review-camp-blood-first-slaughter-fails-just-archery/|title=[DVD Review] 'Camp Blood: First Slaughter' Fails More Than Just Archery|last=Torfe|first=Pat|date=2014-06-19|work=Bloody Disgusting!|access-date=2017-03-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}</ref> which was written and directed by [[Polonia brothers|Mark Polonia]], and is sometimes referred to as ''Camp Blood 3.'' Three more installments were released in 2016 ''Camp Blood 4'', ''Camp Blood 5'', and ''Camp Blood 666''. ''It Kills Camp Blood 7'' and ''The Ghost of Camp Blood'' were later released in 2017.  Like ''First Slaughter'', these films do not take into account the third movie created by Brad Sykes in the ''Camp Blood'' series, ''Within the Woods''.
