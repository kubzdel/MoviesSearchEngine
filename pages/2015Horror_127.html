==Plot==
A-List [[actor]] Colton West has an argument with Darren the [[film director]], and storms off in his car. An [[earthquake]] hits, and Colton sees the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] erupt, spewing [[lava bombs]] all around him. A fire spitting [[tarantula|spider]] the size of a man, comes out of the car in front of him. Colton runs and drives out of the traffic back onto the main road to escape.

Colton arrives home, and tells his wife Olivia about the giant spiders and tells her they need to leave. He takes the shotgun from his house and drives off in his car to find his son Wyatt.

Meanwhile, Wyatt is out with his friends Jordan, Eli and Travis when they hear an explosion and see lots of smoke in the distance, and go to investigate. The teenagers find the source of the explosion to be a [[sink hole]]. Spiders come out of the hole spitting fire and start attacking people. Terrified, the teenagers flee to a warehouse, but Eli gets caught by a spider and is killed.

Colton’s car gets damaged when he hits a lava sink hole. He gets out and finds a tour bus full of people further up the road. He tricks the driver and steals the bus. As he is driving, a spider jumps onto the bus. He brakes heavily and the spider falls off the front of the bus, after which he runs it over. The front of the tour bus starts dissolving because of the spider's blood being acidic. Colton stops the bus and evacuates it just before it blows up.

A spider comes down the chimney in Olivia’s house but she shoots it. The army starts moving into the city, and they rescue Olivia from her house.

Colton gets a lift from his friend, Pirate Jack, a film [[stunt man]]. Jack’s car gets a puncture after hitting a lava vein in the road. Spiders come out of sink holes and chase them into a [[La Brea Tar Pits|museum]]. They meet a scientist in the museum, who is researching the spiders and the [[volcano]]. He works out that the spiders were buried in the magma millions of years ago. Because the spiders became active, they are causing the [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], and that the only way to stop them is to kill the Queen spider.

A spider gets in through a window in the warehouse where the teenagers are hiding and tries to attack them. Wyatt fights the spider with a fire extinguisher. The girl who was burnt earlier, has a fit and dies. Then loads of baby spiders crawl out of her as she catches fire. The baby spiders then attack Travis, setting him on fire and killing him. Wyatt runs to the roof of the warehouse where he gets a phone signal and texts his location to Colton.

The spiders attack the army truck Olivia is in, she hides under a [[fire blanket]] as they breath fire inside the truck. The soldiers all get killed and Olivia kills the spider and drives off in the army truck to try and find Colton.

Meanwhile, the spiders break into the museum. Jack is killed, but Colton manages to escape. Olivia finds Colton and they drive off to rescue Wyatt.

Wyatt climbs off the roof of the warehouse, and is attacked by a spider. Olivia and Colton arrive and run over the spider with the Army truck. Colton realizes that [[liquid nitrogen]] can be used to fight the spiders. They all go to the [[special effect]]s store, where Colton finds his colleagues from the film set.

Colton makes a plan to kill the queen spider with a liquid nitrogen bomb, made using items from the special effects store. He leaves with his film crew, to drop the bombs into the queen’s underground chamber. They plant the bombs around the chamber and detonate them. Lots of spiders come out of sinkholes to the surface. The [[film crew]] shoots them all down. Then, the giant queen spider comes to the surface. Colton uses a jet pack from the film set and flies off a building towards the queen spider. He drops a nitrogen bomb into the spider's mouth, killing it and saving the city.
