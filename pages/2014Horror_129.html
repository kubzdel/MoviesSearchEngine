[[Dread Central]] was enthusiastic about "the sheer amount of charm and fun that is crammed into this movie": "Jackson has crafted an incredibly funny, rich, and ultimately entertaining movie with enough heart to keep you hooked till the end. ... It's a perfect combination of cheesy love story and campy monster movie. ... A lot of my enjoyment from the film comes from how over-the-top it goes, while still maintaining a human element with the love story goofiness. A movie that starts with standard love drama goes to zombies, goose zombies, moose zombies, hordes of squirrel zombies, Abraham Lincoln scientist, Russian immigrant Uncle Sam, and an actual Bigfoot showdown."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/91865/love-time-monsters-2014/ |author= Hentschke, Ted |date= March 4, 2015 |title= ''Love in the Time of Monsters'' (2014) |publisher= Dread Central |accessdate= November 30, 2015}}</ref>
