'''''Morbid: A Love Story''''' is a 2008 [[horror film]], written, directed, and produced by Edward Payson, starring Liam J. Smith and Anna Palestis.

Smith plays the disturbed [[serial killer]], Christian.  Palestis plays his love interest, Belle. Dylan Voorhees plays a young Christian.

Although claiming to be "pretty gruesome", as there is plenty of blood and graphic violence, the film is different from a run-of-the mill [[slasher film]] in that the serial killer is the protagonist.  ''Morbid: A Love Story'' is due to be released in September 2009 with its premiere at the New Beverly Cinema.<ref>https://an-anti-hero-production.ticketleap.com)</ref>

Christian Thomas is a typical college student, but is also a serial killer. He sees death as the greatest art form, ranking his targets by degree of difficulty and making his victims his easel. Christian takes a liking to Belle, a girl in his class, and falls in love. He decides he wants to lead a normal life and stop his killing ways, but old habits die hard.
