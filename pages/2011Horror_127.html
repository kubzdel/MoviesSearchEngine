== Plot ==
Ángela, a [[psychiatry]] student who is skeptical of the existence of the [[paranormal]] in the world, is forced to investigate an old mining town for the purpose of proving or disproving paranormal activity. Along with her, she is accompanied by her younger sister Diana Whisper, who lends Angela her van, and a few other students. They journey to the town and go through some ancient [[salt mines]]. Aware of the danger provided by tampering with the grounds, through the legend of the sadistic Dr. Matarga, they still open a portal to the after life with disastrous consequences. Along the way they each take a journey to the sides of each of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peliculas.labutaca.net/xp3d|title=XP3D (2011)}}</ref>
