==Production==
Gierasch came up with the concept of ''Fractured'' (then titled ''Schism'') after he talked Anderson out of a potentially unpleasant plane trip, which made him feel guilty.<ref name=DC1>{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Sean|title=Screamfest LA 2013 Exclusive: Adam Gierasch and Ashlynn Yennie Talk Schism World Premiere|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/71091/screamfest-la-2013-exclusive-adam-gierasch-and-ashlynn-yennie-talk-schism-world-premiere#axzz30R4CiZkg|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> From there he wondered about the concept of guilt and redemption and "Can you change your fate, or are you damned forever once you fuck up? Can you ever truly make amends?"<ref name=DC1 /> From there Gierasch and Anderson wrote the script and planned for filming to take place in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=DC1 /> Gierasch chose to cast [[Ashlynn Yennie]] in the film due to her role in ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)|The Human Centipede]]''.<ref name=DC2>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Staci Layne|title=Exclusive: Adam Gierasch Talks Fractured|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/75354/exclusive-adam-gierasch-talks-fractured#axzz30R4CiZkg|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The film was given its world premiere in 2013 under the name ''Schism'', but had to undergo a name change before it was given a further release due to the foreign sales company handling the movie.<ref name=DC2 />

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
''[[Fearnet]]'' gave a positive review for ''Fractured'' and praised one of the film's death scenes, as they found it "so dark, disturbing, and visually powerful that it allows one to overlook some rather egregiously cheap CGI gun play that pops up later on."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=FEARNET Movie Review - Fractured|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-fractured|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Shock Till You Drop]]'' and ''[[About.com]]'' both gave less positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web|last=Doro|first=Paul|title=Review: Fractured is a Film With An Identity Crisis|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/352053-review-fractured-2014/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> with ''About.com'' stating that the acting of the film's leads was solid but that the supporting cast was "more uneven" and that the direction was "visually bland".<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Mark H.|title='Fractured' Movie Review|url=http://horror.about.com/od/2014theatricalreviews/fl/Fractured-Movie-Review.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref>
