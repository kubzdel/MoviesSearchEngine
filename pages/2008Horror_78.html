==Plot summary==
The plot deals with nine strangers, most of whom are engaged in criminal and/or morally questionable acts, who wake up on an abandoned [[cargo ship]] with no memory of how they arrived there.<ref name="pi8">{{cite news |work=Philadelphia Inquirer |title=TV Today |date=2008-01-26 |quote=Hope floats — and so does purgatory in this new thriller. Antonio Sabato Jr. stars as one of seven people who wake up aboard a haunted ship. There’s bad news, very bad news, and worse news. They’re dead.}}</ref>  The ship's steward explains the rules to them. The unfortunate passengers soon find out that the ship is haunted by malevolent [[spirits]] and that they've each been brought there for a particular reason. The spirits immediately take those who have committed great sins (i.e. murder, [[adultery]], etc.).

Six of the strangers die because they broke a rule. The remaining 3 learn that they are actually dead. The steward congratulates them for not breaking any rules, and then explains what is happening. According to an old legend, people who have committed sins are transported to this ship after they die. The sea tests them to see if they have learned from their lives. Those who pass the test are given a second chance at life. Those who don't have their spirits swallowed by the sea and are thrown into Hell.

Working together, the three retrieve a boat on the cargo ship and set sail. More demons attempt to kill them on the sea. One of them is sucked to hell after being selfish, and the other two survive and get a second chance. They get back to their lives but have no memory of the events on the ship and do not remember each other when they meet. The last scene shows the steward explaining the rules to the next set of strangers, implying a continuous cycle.
