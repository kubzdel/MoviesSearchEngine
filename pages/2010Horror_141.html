'''''Rubber''''' is a 2010 English-language French [[independent film|independent]] [[horror film]] about a [[tire]] that comes to life and kills people with its [[Psychokinesis|psychic powers]].

It was shown at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2010, where it received positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
===Intermission===
A group of people in a California desert are gathered to watch a "film". A sheriff, Chad ([[Stephen Spinella]]), points out that many moments in cinema happen for "no reason", that life is full of this "no reason", and that "this film" ([[Indexical|presumably a dual reference to both the "film" to be watched by the assembled group and ''Rubber'' itself]]) is an homage to "no reason".

An accountant ([[Jack Plotnick]]) then passes out binoculars to the group and rides off on a bicycle. The spectators then start looking through their binoculars into the distance, waiting for the "film" to start. Throughout the film, this group of people return in order to gauge their reactions to what has taken place so far.

===Film Synopsis===
In the late 1990s, somewhere in a California desert, a tire named Robert suddenly comes to life. At first, it learns how to stand upright and then how to roll. It comes across a plastic water bottle and, after hesitating, crushes it. It then comes across a scorpion and crushes it. It then comes across a glass beer bottle but is unable to crush it by rolling over it. It then starts to vibrate intensely and psychokinetically causes the bottle to fracture. It then induces a tin can and a rabbit to explode.

The tire then sees a woman ([[Roxane Mesquida]]) drive by and attempts to use its powers on her. However, it only succeeds in making her car stall. As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs the tire over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again and she continues on her way. The tire explodes a pied crow, then finds the man that had been driving the truck which ran him over and blows up his head.

Arriving in a nearby desert town, the tire comes across the woman in the car. She is staying in a motel and, after watching her shower through an open door, the tire goes into the room next to hers. After the motel maid finds the tire showering and throws it out of the room, the tire reenters the room and blows up her head. Chad, the sheriff from the opening of the movie, shows up to investigate the murders. Chad is both inside and outside the [[diegesis]], sometimes participating in the narrative action and sometimes commenting on it.

The accountant tries to end the movie early by feeding the audience a poisoned turkey, but one of them, a man in a wheelchair, does not partake and survives. The accountant then informs Chad. Chad witnesses the tire kill the motel owner (who has mistreated it) and leads the cops on a "tire hunt". Meanwhile, the accountant tries to poison the man in the wheelchair with more food, but ends up eating it himself and dying.

As the tire is running from the police, it comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires. The film then jumps to three days later showing the results of a killing spree. The cops find the tire watching an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling the woman the tire is interested in) with dynamite, intending for the tire to blow the mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when the tire destroys the mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills the tire with a shotgun, after which he gives the tire to the man in the wheelchair. A tricycle emerges from the house and kills the man in the wheelchair. The tricycle begins rolling down the road; other tires begin rolling behind it and they eventually roll to Hollywood, where the film concludes.

==Production==

The effects of the tire moving were done via practical effects such as [[remote controls]].<ref name="BD">{{cite web|last1=Harley|first1=David|title=Interview: ‘Rubber’ Director Quentin Dupieux!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/22865/interview-rubber-director-quentin-dupieux/|website=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> Director Quentin Dupieux has noted that due to the inherent "emptiness" of a tire that making a remote-controlled tire was difficult as "you can’t really hide the mechanisms well". [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects were used for the shots of heads exploding; during filming Dupieux used practical effects, but he was unhappy with the results.<ref name="BD"/>

During the writing process the tire, Robert, was designed solely as a bad guy with no redeeming qualities.<ref name="CB">{{cite web|last1=Nemiroff|first1=Perri|title=Interview: Rubber Writer-Director Quentin Dupieux|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Rubber-Writer-Director-Quentin-Dupieux-23286.html|website=Cinemablend|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref> While shooting, however, Dupieux determined that this was the wrong approach realizing "there’s nothing evil about a tire" based partly on early camera tests. Robert was reworked to be "more like a stupid dog"<ref name="CB"/>. [[WALL-E]], specifically the first act, was also an influence on the character.<ref name="BD"/>

The film begins with Ballard making a speech about how events in movies often happen for "no reason". Dupieux has stated he was inclined to put that speech in because he was not interested in explaining how the tire came to life, although he knew such a setup would be expected.<ref name="BD"/> The meta element of the film came organically, as Dupieux quickly tired of writing about a killer tire. He was partly influenced by an experience where he snuck into a theater playing his previous film "Steak" only to find that no one else was in the theater, which he noted was "kind of scary."<ref name="BD"/>

==Release==
The film was shown on May 15, 2010 at Cannes Critic's Week.<ref name="v-review" />

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a 69% rating based on reviews from 83 critics, the sites consensus reads "a clever premise gets plenty of comic blood and violence but it's hampered by some questionable storytelling techniques from director "Quentin Dupieux".<ref>{{rotten tomatoes|id=rubber |title=Rubber}}</ref> [[indieWire]] called the film "one of the more bizarre experiments with genre in quite some time" and that it "does begin to wear out its welcome around the sixty-minute mark, but you can't blame Dupieux for giving it a shot."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/cannes_review_bad_ideas_in_close_up_quentin_dupieuxs_rubber/|title=Cannes Review : Bad Ideas In Close Up: Quentin Dupieux's "Rubber"|author=Kohn, Eric|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010|work=indieWire}}</ref>

Outside Cannes, the film received positive reception at other film festivals. [[Twitch Film]] gave the film a positive review saying it was "impeccably shot, scored and designed", and "the film is intellectual wankery<!-- sic, calling it wankery is backhanded praise and actually in the source --> of the highest order in the sheepskin of a B-film of the lowest order".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2010/07/fantasia-2010-rubber-review-1.php|title= Fantasia 2010: Rubber Review|last= Halfyard|first= Kurt|date= July 10, 2010|accessdate= October 17, 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729150118/http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2010/07/fantasia-2010-rubber-review-1.php|archivedate= July 29, 2010|df= }}</ref> ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote that Quentin Dupieux "succeeds in creating an entertaining, sometimes even tense horror film with the very same footage he lightly mocks. The result is an uber-cerebral spoof that is at once silly and smart, populist like a mildly trashy B-movie yet high brow like absurdist theater."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/farihah-zaman/2010-fantastic-fest-2-goo_b_759654.html|title=2010 Fantastic Fest #2: Good Movies, Stupid Plots| last = Zaman |first= Farihah|date=October 12, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote a negative review of the film, saying "How could it not be brilliant? By, at 85 minutes, being an hour too long. By being arch rather than schlocky. And by wasting too much time on dull dialogue celebrating its 'No Reason' philosophy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/cannes-film-festival/7733542/Cannes-Film-Festival-Quentin-Dupieuxs-Rubber-review.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|author=Sukhdev, Sandhu|date=May 17, 2010|accessdate=October 17, 2010|title=Cannes Film Festival: Quentin Dupieux's Rubber, review}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also gave a negative review, saying that ''Rubber'' is "Neither scary, funny, nor anywhere near as clever as it seems to think it is, pic offers auds few reasons to want to see it beyond its one-joke premise."<ref name="v-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942777.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=Rubber|author=Felperin, Leslie|accessdate=October 17, 2010|date=May 16, 2010|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Will Leitch from ''The Projector'' concluded his review by stating that "Rubber" is "a movie about how watching movies is stupid," giving the film a D score out of a traditional American grading scale.<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/the-projector/review-rubber-205110422.html ''Rubber'' Movie Review] Yahoo!Movies</ref>

Gregory Bernard said of the film: "We’re really blessed to have so much attention on such a small film. We both took risks – [Quentin] artistically, me in production – and the fact that we had, in general, a very positive response from the public; we’ve had audiences who really loved it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/04/12/on-rubber-wrong-and-reality-producer-gregory-bernard-discusses-working-with-quentin-dupieux/|title=On Rubber, Wrong And Reality - Producer Gregory Bernard Discusses Working With Quentin Dupieux - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=12 April 2011|publisher=}}</ref>
