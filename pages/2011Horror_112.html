==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Morituris'' has been mixed, with some decrying what they saw as extreme [[misogyny]] and gratuitous scenes of [[rape]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=Fantasia Fest 2011: 'Morituris' Review|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fantasia-fest-2011-morituris-review|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> ''[[Twitch Film]]'' gave a mostly positive review, commenting that they found the extended rape scene almost unbearable but that overall that there is "a thin line between misanthropic fun and a hardcore exploitation film. "Morituris" uses scissors in order to cut this line and messes with audiences expectations."<ref>{{cite web|last=Keshales|first=Aharon|title=Fantasia 2011: MORITURIS Review|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2011/08/fantasia-2011-morituris-review.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' praised the movie overall, commenting that while some viewers might grow impatient that the zombie gladiators do not appear until much later in the film, that when they do appear it is a "face splattering, spear gouging, cat-o-nine-tails whipping, sword slashing, crucifyingly good time."<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR covers new horrors: INCIDENT!

''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' staff reviewer "Mr Disgusting" was highly critical of the movie, giving it "Negative 100 million out of 5 Skulls" and stating "I’m not a sensitive guy (at all), I don’t get offended, and frankly I wasn’t offended – but ''Morituris'' does show viewers what a disgusting piece of trash the filmmaker is. Every single thing that happens comes with such a complete lack in taste. So to the director and the movie: f*ck off."<ref name=BDR>{{cite web|last=Mr Disgusting|title=Morituris|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/158720/morituris/?tab=bd-review|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> This prompted Picchio and screenwriter/producer Gianluigi Perrone to respond to the reviewer to address issues brought up in the review.<ref name=BDR /> Perrone explained that they used the film's violence against women as a way of showing "one of the most vile crimes against women" as a "way of showing the evil of mankind and it’s decadence" and that the end title's credit of "in memory of mankind" was indicative of this.<ref name=BDI>{{cite web|last=Mr Disgusting|title=[Interview] Italian Filmmakers Defend The Controversial 'Morituris'!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/25986/interview-italian-filmmakers-defend-the-controversial-morituris/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref> They also used some scenes, such as a cutaway to a man in another location inserting a mouse into a woman's vagina, to show that "some crimes happens not only in the hidden of a forest but also in the core of a metropolis like Rome".<ref name=BDI />
