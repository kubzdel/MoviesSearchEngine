'''''The Boy''''' is a 2015 American [[Horror (genre)|horror]] film directed by [[Craig Macneill]], written by Macneill and Clay McLeod Chapman, and starring [[Jared Breeze]], [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], and [[Rainn Wilson]].  It was based on a short film by Macneill and Chapman, ''Henley'', which was in turn loosely inspired by a novel written by Chapman, ''Miss Corpus''.  Breeze plays the titular boy, a budding [[serial killer]].

== Synopsis ==
{{More plot|date=January 2016}}
Ted Henley ([[Jared Breeze]]) and his father ([[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]]) operate a floundering family business—The Mt. Vista Motel. It’s just the two of them since Ted’s mother ran off with a guest years earlier, stealing the motel’s soul and one of its last regular patrons. Since then, Ted’s father has drifted into despondency—becoming a living ghost, haunting his own motel and leaving Ted to fend for himself. In his isolation, unchecked by the bounds of parenting, friendship, or affection, Ted's fascination with death awakens with destructive consequences.<ref>http://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/events/event_FS17770</ref>

== Production ==
The story has its genesis in a book written by Clay McLeod Chapman, ''Miss Corpus''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/51868/the-boy-doles-out-more-casting-news/|title=The Boy Doles Out More Casting News|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2014-02-26|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>  Chapman said that few people read it except for Craig William Macneill, the film's co-writer and director.  Fond of one chapter in particular, Macneill suggested they expand it to a short film, which eventually screened at the [[Sundance Film Festival]].  [[SpectreVision]] took an interest in the short, and it was expanded to feature length.  A full trilogy is planned in which the lead character's progress will be examined at the ages of 9, 13, and 18.  The trilogy is not based on the book and is original material.<ref name=aicn>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/70811|title=SXSW '15: Vinyard questions director Craig William Macneill and writer Clay McLeod Chapman about THE BOY!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2015-03-22|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>  Macneill expects the films to be released in quick succession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/03/sxsw-director-craig-william-macneill-talks-about-making-maniac-horror-thriller-0|title=SXSW: Director Craig William Macneill talks about making a maniac in horror-thriller The Boy|last=Collis|first=Clark|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2015-03-03|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>  Filming began on February 17, 2014, in [[Medellin, Colombia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rainn-wilson-mike-vogel-joining-683854|title=Rainn Wilson, Mike Vogel Joining Horror Pic 'The Boy'|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2014-02-26|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>  Colombia was chosen due to its tax incentives and the fact that they could afford to build their own set – something not possible in the United States for their budget.

== Reception ==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 61% of 18 surveyed critics gave it a positive review with an average rating of 5.6/10,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_boy_2015/|title=The Boy (2015)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2015-11-07}}</ref> while [[Metacritic]] rated it 45/100 based on reviews from eight critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-boy-2015|title=The Boy|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2015-09-08}}</ref> Both Eric Kohn of [[Indiewire]] and Charlie Schmidlin of [[The Playlist]] found the film to be effective but dramatically lacking. Kohn wrote that the film "maintains a gripping sense of atmospheric dread", although its "consistently grave tone sometimes threatens to suffocate the dramatic momentum",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sxsw-review-the-boy-is-the-chilling-start-to-the-story-of-a-psychopath-20150316|title=SXSW Review: 'The Boy' is the Chilling Start to the Story of a Psychopath|last=Kohn|first=Eric|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=2015-03-16|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> while Schmidlin felt that the film has "extremely effective" parts, but it plays into negative stereotypes of "slow burn" psychological dramas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/sxsw-review-director-craig-macneills-the-boy-starring-jared-breeze-david-morse-rainn-wilson-20150323|title=SXSW Review: Director Craig Macneill’s 'The Boy' Starring Jared Breeze, David Morse & Rainn Wilson|last=Schmidlin|first=Charlie|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=2015-03-23|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> These sentiments were echoed by [[Ain't It Cool News]] who praised its "dark, broody tone",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/70867|title=SXSW '15: Vinyard checks out THE BOY and BONE IN THE THROAT!|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=2015-03-25|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> and by Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' who wrote that the film seemed "endless and dull".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-the-boy-1201453276/|title=SXSW Film Review: 'The Boy'|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2015-03-17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>    

Of the film's director, Craig Macneill, Carson Lund of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' wrote, "Even if his talents tip the scales toward overstatement, Macneill has a command for composition and rhythm that belies his skinny résumé, and one can't help but be unnerved by Breeze's relentlessly deer-in-the-headlights performance as the [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] Ted."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/article/sxsw-2015-the-boy-6-years-a-poem-is-a-naked-person|title=SXSW 2015: The Boy, 6 Years, & A Poem Is a Naked Person|last=Lund|first=Carson|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2015-03-17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> Samuel Zimmerman of [[Shock Till You Drop]] commended Macneill's restraint and noted that his "disinterest in making a traditional slasher, let alone an iconic one, ultimately ends up with one of the most memorable contemporary iterations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/375935-sxsw-review-the-boy-hes-a-growing-slasher/|title=SXSW Review: The Boy, He’s a Growing Slasher|last=Zimmerman|first=Samuel|work=[[Shock Till You Drop]]|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> Marjorie Baumgarten of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' also found it "more measured than the usual demon-child fare".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-03-18/sxsw-film-review-the-boy/|title=SXSW Film Review: The Boy|last=Baumgarten|first=Marjorie|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=2015-03-18|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' was impressed by the acting and wrote, "If the film itself slips a little too easily into the banality it’s chronicling at times, The Boy is sustained by the measured performances of the handful of wayward souls in its sparse, bleak world."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/sxsw-film-review-the-boy/|title=SXSW Film Review: The Boy|last=Suzanne-Mayer|first=Dominick|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=2015-03-15|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> 

Drew Tinnin of [[Dread Central]] and Anton Bitel of [[Sight and Sound]] both believed that the film rewarded patient viewing. Tinnin wrote that "The slow start (and maybe a little of the middle) does pay off, however, with a conclusion that's shocking even after seeing what Ted’s already been up to",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/93696/boy-the-2015/|title=Boy, The (2015)|last=Tinnin|first=Drew|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2015-03-17|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref> while Bitel found it to be "a slow-burner that builds and builds to its climactic conflagration". Bitel also compared it to [[Richard Linklater]]'s ''[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]'' and considered ''The Boy'' to be a "disturbing flipside" to Linklater's film that succeeds in creating an "austere and chilling portrait of America's abandoned margins".<ref>http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/london-2015/cult-round-up</ref> Andy Webster of the ''[[New York Times]]'' was impressed overall; he felt that the film worked despite its dramatic shortcomings, and called it "a feature stunning to behold" despite finding it "somewhat unpersuasive in narrative".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/21/movies/review-in-the-boy-an-unnerving-9-year-old-makes-his-move.html?_r=0|title=Review: In ‘The Boy,’ an Unnerving 9-Year-Old Makes His Move|last=Webster|first=Andy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2015-08-20|accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> However, Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' took an opposing view and wrote, "While it's admirable that director Macneill and his co-scripter Clay McLeod Chapman opted to emphasize mood and psychology over the story's more exploitable elements, it nonetheless results in a listless tedium that isn't helped by the overly long running time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/boy-sxsw-review-784373|title='The Boy': SXSW Review|last=Scheck|first=Frank|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2015-03-25|accessdate=2015-04-12}}</ref>

Hanley of ''[[Fangoria]]'' listed ''The Boy'' as one of his top ten horror films of 2015 and it also received two [[Fangoria Chainsaw Award]] nominations in the Best Supporting Actor and Best Score categories.<ref>http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-year-in-horror-2015-kens-top-10-horror-films</ref><ref>http://www.fangoria.com/new/never-mind-oscar-heres-the-2016-fangoria-chainsaw-awards-nominees-ballot/</ref> Zack Sharf and Emily Buder of [[Indiewire]] selected the film as one of their "13 Most Criminally Overlooked Indies and Foreign Films of 2015",<ref>http://www.indiewire.com/article/the-13-most-criminally-overlooked-indies-and-foreign-films-of-2015-20151219</ref> while [[HitFix]] included it in their list of "14 Great Under the Radar Films from 2015".<ref>http://www.hitfix.com/news/14-great-under-the-radar-films-from-2015</ref>
