'''''Apollo 18''''' is a 2011 American-Canadian [[alternate history]] [[found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] written by Brian Miller, directed by [[Gonzalo López-Gallego]], and produced by [[Timur Bekmambetov]] and Ron Schmidt. After various release date changes, the film was released in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada on September 2, 2011; however, the release dates for other territories vary.<ref name="avc" /> The film is López-Gallego's first English-language movie.

The film's premise is that the [[Canceled Apollo missions|cancelled Apollo 18 mission]] actually landed on the Moon in December 1974, but never returned, and as a result the United States has never launched another expedition to the Moon. The film is shot in [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style, supposedly "lost footage" of the Apollo 18 mission that was only recently discovered.

==Plot==
In December 1974, the crew of the cancelled ''Apollo 18'' mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. [[Commander]] Nathan Walker, [[Lieutenant colonel]] John Grey, and [[Captain]] Ben Anderson are launched toward the [[Moon]] to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending [[ICBM]] attacks from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

Grey remains in orbit aboard the ''Freedom'' command module while Walker and Anderson land on the Moon in the lunar module ''Liberty''. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take rock samples. After returning to ''Liberty'', the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of ''Liberty'' despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lander]], and a [[Lost Cosmonauts|dead cosmonaut]] in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission.

The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when ''Liberty'' suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to ''Liberty'' and non-human tracks that Walker cites as evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]]. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of ''Liberty''. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walker's chest; Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.

Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of ''Liberty'', revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within ''Liberty'', but he accidentally damages the system controls, causing ''Liberty'' to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK is 
their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their [[lunar rover]]. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the Moon, because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth.

Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to the crater where they found the cosmonaut. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK. Anderson uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control who connect him to the Department of Defense. The deputy secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to ''Freedom''. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing he had survived the alien encounter earlier. However, he is now completely psychotic and demands to be let in. When Anderson refuses to let him in, he tries to break the lander's window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is attacked by a swarm of creatures inside his helmet, which causes his head to explode, killing him.

Anderson launches, but the DoD warns Grey that Anderson is infected and orders him to abort the rescue or communication will be cut off, without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth. The lander's engines shut off as it enters orbit, and it is in free fall. Small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be alien creatures. Anderson is attacked and infected by the creatures, preventing him from controlling the vehicle. Grey tells Anderson that he is moving too fast as the LK crashes into ''Freedom'' killing them both (though it could be implied Grey survived from an alternate ending, as he was venting his anger at a DoD member back on Earth). The space footage ends abruptly.

The footage cuts to before the pilots' mission, showing them having a barbecue with friends and family. The "official" fate of the astronauts is given, describing them as having died in various accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable. An epilogue explains that many of the rock samples returned from the previous Apollo missions are now missing.

==Alternate Endings==
In the first ending, Ben is in the LK. Nate was attacked by the creatures on his helmet, and his head explodes, killing him. Then Ben is surrounded by Aliens and he's losing some oxygen of the LK and dies. Then the alien leaves the shot, ending the alternate ending.

In the next ending, Ben is in the LK and he's being attacked by an Alien race. The Alien breaks the window of the LK and kills Ben with a pincer.

In the last ending, Ben is in the LK, after colliding with the ''Freedom'' ship where John was. Ben is infected and the alarm begins to sound, because the LK is falling back to the moon. Seconds later, Ben dies when the LK falls and crashes with the crater of the moon.

===Background===
The film concludes with a statement that the Nixon Administration gave away hundreds of Moon rocks to [[Ambassador|foreign dignitaries]] around the world, and that many of these Moon rocks have been lost or stolen. This is actually true; both the Nixon and Ford Administrations gave away 135 Apollo 11 Moon rocks and 135 Apollo 17 [[Moon rock#Goodwill moon rocks|goodwill Moon rocks]]. The Moon Rock Project, a joint effort of over 1,000 graduate students started at the University of Phoenix in 2002, has helped track down, recover or locate many Moon rocks and found that 160 are unaccounted for, lost or destroyed.<ref>[http://www.geotimes.org/nov04/trends.html In Search of the Goodwill Moon Rocks: A Personal Account] Geotimes Magazine. November 2004.</ref> In 1998, a sting operation, called Operation Lunar Eclipse, made up of personnel from [[NASA]]'s [[Office of the Inspector General]], the [[U.S. Postal Inspection Service]] and [[U.S. Customs]] recovered the Honduras Apollo 17 goodwill Moon rock, valued at $5 million. In October 2011, NASA agents raided a Denny's restaurant and arrested a 74-year-old woman for attempting to sell a Moon rock from Neil Armstrong for $1.7 million on the black market.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2052819/NASA-raids-Dennys-Joann-Davis-74-tries-sell-Neil-Armstrong-Moon-dust.html NASA agents raid Denny's in undercover sting—after woman, 74, tries to sell moon dust that was gift from Neil Armstrong] Mail Online, October 24, 2011.</ref>
