{{nihongo|'''''Stacy'''''|ステーシー|Suteishi|also known as ''Stacy: Attack of the Schoolgirl Zombies''}} is a Japanese [[horror film|horror]] [[comedy film]], released in 2001. It is based on a novel by [[Kenji Ohtsuki]] directed by [[Naoyuki Tomomatsu]], in which teenage girls turn into [[zombie]]s.

==Plot summary==

In the near future, the entire world is struck with a bizarre malady which affects every girl between the ages of 14 and 16 years old.

Victims first experience a period of giddiness called "Near Death Happiness" ("NDH" or 臨死遊戯状態) before expiring.  Within minutes of death the victim rises again as a flesh-eating zombie—a "Stacy". These Stacies run amok until they are cut into pieces in an act called a "Repeat-Kill" (再殺).

The government has organized the poorly trained "Romero Repeat-Kill Troops," who ride around on garbage trucks, ordered to act out the disposal of the Stacies.  By law, a Stacy may only be Repeat-Killed by her loved ones or the Romero Repeat Kill Troops.

Through research, it is discovered that a key to the Stacy phenomenon is the "Butterfly Twinkle Powder" (BTP or 蝶羽状輝徽粉) that accumulates on the Stacies' skin.
