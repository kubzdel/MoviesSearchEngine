==Production==
Due to the success of ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 Hollywood film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' and ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'', the idea of producing ''The Child's Eye'' as a 3-D film was greenlit.<ref name="hwr" /> ''The Child's Eye'' is the first 3D Hong Kong horror film and the first Hong Kong production to be entirely shot in 3-D and in high definition.<ref name="FBA" /> Director Danny Pang stated that when he "went to see the 3-D Hollywood films the first chance we got...The technology of 3-D filming is now well-developed enough for us to try applying our horror style."<ref name="hwr" />

The film began shooting in June 2009 in [[Thailand]].<ref name="hwr">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/3-d-shock-awe-pang-81088|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Chu, Karen|title=3-D shock and awe from Pang brothers|date=March 22, 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2010}} {{registration required}}</ref> The Pang brothers stated they had difficulty with the camera movement, editing, and filming on location in 3D, saying "It took 10 hours to get 12 shots. It took more time to adjust the lighting for the 3-D effects.

===Reception===
The film received generally negative reviews after its premiere. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented on a weak script, and notes that the "hands pop out of the ground, monsters lunge camerawards, and other shocktastic devices that even [[William Castle]] would have thought corny are deployed...Outside Asia, this one looks destined to be eyeballed mostly by cultists."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117943438.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=The Child's Eye 3D|author=Felperin, Leslie|accessdate=September 14, 2010|date=September 5, 2010}}</ref> Film Business Asia gave the film a three out of ten rating, stating that "The Child's Eye 3D is not as lame as the previous entry in the Pang Brothers' Eye cycle, [[The Eye 10]]...The fault, as with so many of the brothers' films, lies in the script, which generates little characterisation among its six young leads (actually three, for most of the film) and relies purely on eerie sound effects, sudden crashes on the soundtrack and ghost/monster shots for its horror."<ref name="FBA" /> ''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' gave the film a mixed review, stating that the script is a "strictly by-the-numbers affair, there are more than a few nicely set-up 3D moments and a healthy moment of surreal filmmaking in amidst the film's horror-in-a-hotel tale."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/-the-childs-eye-3d-tungngaan-3d/5017815.article|title=The Child's Eye 3D (Tungngaan 3D)|author=Adams, Mark|accessdate=September 15, 2010|date=September 6, 2010|work=[[Screen Daily]]}}{{registration required}}</ref> ''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5, saying that "poor acting, the lack of cast cohesiveness and too many plot holes makes this wannabe fright flick one huge disappointment".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/Entertainment/Movies/EDC101013-0000053/Frightfully-boring|work=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]|title=Frightfully boring|author=Loh, Genevieve|date=October 13, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017211537/http://www.todayonline.com/Entertainment/Movies/EDC101013-0000053/Frightfully-boring|archivedate=October 17, 2010}}</ref>
