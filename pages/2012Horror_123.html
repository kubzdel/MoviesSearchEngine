===Creature effects===

Matt Wavish, writing for the Horror Cult Films website and giving the movie only 2.5 stars out of 10 in his review, was one of few reviewers who admired the werewolf effects: "When the werewolf does finally appear, it is quite cool. Clever lighting and camera angles hide the films low budget, and enable the rather large monster to actually look impressive for most of the time."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://horrorcultfilms.co.uk/2013/05/love-bite-2012/ |author= Wavish, Matt |date= 24 May 2013 |title= ''Love Bite'' (2012) |publisher= Horror Cult Films |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref>

Reviewer Karl De Mesa mourned the underabundance of werewolf sightings: "when we do see the beast the darn CGI makes it look like this one might just fall into the B-movie bin."<ref name= "GMA">{{cite web |url= http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/336474/lifestyle/movie-review-werewolves-heart-virgins-in-love-bite |author= De Mesa, Karl R. |date= 21 November 2013 |title= Movie review: Werewolves heart virgins in ''Love Bite'' |publisher= GMA Network |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref>

Reviewer Ellis Whitehouse expressed some outrage: "The wolf itself is a disgustingly ugly piece of CGI work, with it changing size and shape as the scenes progress, one minute it'll be twice the size a human with the fattest head in existence, next it'll be a puny mongrel cowering in front of a car on the road."<ref name= "PM">{{cite web |url= http://platform-online.net/2012/11/review-love-bite-de-emmony-2012/ |author= Whitehouse, Ellis |date= 12 November 2012 |title= Review: ''Love Bite'' (De Emmony, 2012) |publisher= ''Platform Magazine'' |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref>

==Marketing==

De Emmony shopped ''Love Bite'' at the [[American Film Market]] 2011 event, allegedly hoping to appeal to the audience of ''[[The Inbetweeners Movie]]''.<ref name= "West" />

The movie's [[tagline]] is "Dying...to get laid." Two official [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] were released.

==Release==
The film was released on 9 November 2012.

== Reception ==

Movie reviews were mixed. Michael Juvinall of the Horror Society liked it - "a clever mix of horror and humor" - with the proviso, "We don't see too much of the werewolf in the film and what we do see is CGI, which was a little disappointing for me."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.horrorsociety.com/2014/11/10/love-bite-2012-review/ |author= Juvinall, Michael |date= 10 November 2014 |title= ''Love Bite'' (2012) Review |publisher= Horror Society |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref> A reviewer for ''GMA News Online'' was also mostly positive: "Add a generous tone of comedy to this naughty UK horror movie and what you've got are well-sketched characters and great plot potential that, unfortunately, just drags in the execution. There's a lot of side stories here that never get developed and left unresolved like stray threads. For all its faults though, ''Love Bite'' is as entertaining as its mix of supernatural and sex promises. Credit the young actors for this. There's genuine chemistry between Szohr and Speleers..."<ref name= "GMA" />

Reviewer Adam Cook wrote, "''Love Bite'' is a risible British horror-comedy that spectacularly fails to deliver either horror or comedy."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://letterboxd.com/lordcookie/film/love-bite-2012/ |author= Cook, Adam |date= 24 August 2013 |title= ''Love Bite'' (2012) |publisher= |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref> Horrornews.net reviewer Lizzie Duncan "found none of the main characters that likeable, and this is the key reason why the entire thing seemed to drag on (despite being a relatively short film). ... The whole film is rather vile and crude..."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://horrornews.net/45089/love-bite-2012/ |author= Duncan, Lizzie |date= 23 March 2013 |title= Film Review: ''Love Bite'' (2012) |publisher= horrornews.net |accessdate= 30 November 2015}}</ref>  Ellis Whitehouse, giving 1 out of 10 points, begins by referencing ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Zombieland]]'' and asks, "Is ''Love Bite'' the latest in an emerging trend of comedy-horror triumphs? No; it is the exact opposite"; he calls the script "pathetic" and the dialogue "basic, uninspiring, unintelligent and down-right insulting."<ref name= "PM" />
