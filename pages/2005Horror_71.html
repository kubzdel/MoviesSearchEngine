'''''The Fog''''' is a 2005 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Rupert Wainwright]] and starring [[Tom Welling]], [[Selma Blair]], and [[Maggie Grace]]. It is a remake of [[John Carpenter]]'s 1980 [[The Fog|film of the same name]] and was produced by Carpenter and [[Debra Hill]] who co-wrote the original film. The film's narrative follows a strange fog that sweeps in over an island town in the coast of [[Oregon]]; it brings vindictive apparitions of mariners who were murdered there 134 years prior. The townspeople find themselves trapped and fighting for their lives while investigating the truth of their history.

In 1871, William Blake arranges to purchase half of Antonio Island, off the coast of [[Oregon]], to establish a [[leper colony]] for his afflicted people. However, island residents Patrick Malone, Norman Castle, Richard Wayne and David Williams [[Betrayal#Double_cross|double cross]] Blake. During a foggy night, they loot his [[Clipper|clipper ship]] the ''Elizabeth Dane'' and set it on fire, killing all aboard. One hundred and thirty-four years later, the residents of Antonio Island prepare to honor their founding fathers—the same men who burned the ''Elizabeth Dane''—and a statue of them is to be unveiled on the town's anniversary. 

During a boating trip, Nick Castle and his friend Spooner unwittingly disturb a bag containing a [[pocket watch]] and a hairbrush from the ''Elizabeth Dane'' lying on the seabed. That night, Nick meets his former girlfriend, Elizabeth Williams, who has returned after six months. Elizabeth is shown the antique pocket watch by Machen, an old man who found it washed up on the beach. He warns her ominously ''"if you touch it, things will change."'' The watch begins ticking as Elizabeth holds it. She sees a [[hallmark]] on it, which includes a set of scales. Later, weird supernatural occurrences start to plague the town. Objects move by themselves, power outages occur, and the windows in Nick's truck inexplicably shatter. Nick and Elizabeth then encounter drunken priest Father Malone, who is ranting about murderers and retribution. Meanwhile, at the local radio station, host Stevie Wayne gets a phone call from weatherman Dan about a large fog bank off the coast. Out at sea on Nick's boat, Spooner and Nick's cousin Sean are partying with two young women, Mandi and Jennifer. As the fog reaches them, the boat's engine stops, and the instruments break. An old clipper ship appears in the fog next to them. Seemingly possessed, Jennifer draws a set of scales on a misted window inside the boat. Unseen forces then kill Mandi, Jennifer, and Sean. At Nick's beach house, Elizabeth has been dreaming about the ''Elizabeth Dane''. She searches the Internet for information about the hallmark symbol she saw earlier, but her computer malfunctions, and the word "Dane" appears on the screen. She hears a knock at the front door, goes outside but finds nothing. Walking down to the beach, the fog begins approaching, but Nick brings her back inside.

The next day, Nick's Uncle Hank telephones him about the disappearance of his boat. Nick and Elizabeth sail out and find the vessel and the three corpses. Elizabeth goes into the hold and finds Spooner alive in a freezer. They return to the island where Mayor Tom Malone—Father Malone's father—suspects Spooner of the murders. In the morgue, Sean's corpse briefly rises up and accosts Elizabeth. At the library, Elizabeth researches the scales symbol seen on the watch's hallmark. It represented an old [[Trading post|trading colony]] north of Antonio Island, which was afflicted with leprosy. At the docks, Elizabeth finds the buried journal of Patrick Malone from 1871. She and Nick learn the story of the ''Elizabeth Dane'' and realize the founders built the town with the fortune they had stolen from the ship, but kept this secret from their families and the townsfolk.

The ghosts of the ''Elizabeth Dane'' seek revenge against Antonio Island's residents for the past crimes of its founding fathers. After killing Dan at the weather station, they pursue Stevie's son Andy and his Aunt Connie at home. Connie is killed, but Nick and Elizabeth rescue Andy. In her car, Stevie is also attacked, but she escapes. They travel to the Town Hall where the founders' murderous secrets are exposed. The spirits kill Hank Castle, Kathy Williams and the Malones. The ghost of Blake then seeks Elizabeth. Despite being a descendant of David Williams, Elizabeth is the reincarnation of Blake's wife and was one of her ancestor's victims; hence, her mysterious dreams about the ''Elizabeth Dane''. Blake kisses Elizabeth, and she transforms into a spirit and disappears as Nick watches helplessly. The next day, the survivors try to cope with their traumatic experiences and the truth about their ancestors. As Stevie reflects on the night's events with her listeners, Nick throws Patrick Malone's journal into the sea.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
The original film's makers, [[John Carpenter]] and [[Debra Hill]], expressed interest in remaking the original film on the film's DVD commentary.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Carpenter, John & Hill, Debra|year=2002 |title=The Fog audio commentary |trans-title=|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM]] |location=United States}}</ref> They are both credited as producers for the remake. The 2005 film was green-lit by [[Revolution Studios]] before the script was finished. Tom Welling had three weeks filming on the fourth season of his TV series ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' when he started work on ''The Fog''.  Blair performed almost all of her stunts and spent 12 hours in a water tank with only short surface breaks for two days to shoot her underwater scenes. [[StudioCanal]]—which owns the rights to the original film—assisted in the film's production in exchange for French distribution rights.

Although set on an island off the Oregon coast, the location scenes were filmed in Canada. Some scenes were filmed around [[Cowichan Bay]], most of the beach scenes were filmed in [[Tofino]], and those of the town of Antonio Bay were filmed on [[Bowen Island]] and [[Fort Langley]]—all in [[British Columbia]].  It was one of Hill's final projects before her death from cancer in 2005.
