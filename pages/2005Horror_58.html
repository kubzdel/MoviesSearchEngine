In 1911, an abusive father forces his daughter, Sophia, to bury her four beloved handmade dolls (an African [[warrior]], a German [[soldier]], a baby, and a [[samurai]]<ref>[http://www.coldfusionvideo.com/d/dollgraveyard.html Cold Fusion Video Reviews: Doll Graveyard<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>) in their backyard, despite her pleas.  After the girl accidentally falls into the dolls' grave and breaks her neck, the stepfather buries her with the dolls to conceal his crime.{{Clarify|date=October 2014}} 

One hundred years later, the house is now occupied by the Fillbrook family: young Guy, his teenage sister Deedee, and their father. Guy is frequently the victim of Tom and Rich, a pair of older bullies whom Deedee admires. Like Sophia, Guy is shy and retiring, preferring to stay in his room with his vast collection of [[action figures]]. 

While doing yardwork, Guy discovers the samurai doll in the backyard. Suspecting the doll is valuable, he decides to clean it up, in spite of the protests of his older sister, Deedee, who accuses him of avoiding work. Later, when their father goes out on a date, Deedee invites her friends, Olivia and Terri, over for a party. Guy reluctantly agrees to keep the party secret after he learns that Terri enjoys some of the same action figures as he does. 

Meanwhile, Olivia secretly invites Tom and Rich to their party. The boys break into Guy's room, bully him, tie him to a chair, and break one of his precious action figures before leaving to party with the girls. At this, the spirit of Sophia possesses the samurai doll and resurrects the other buried dolls to take revenge on Guy's tormentors by killing them in gruesome ways, before moving on to attack the girls.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=335875 Doll Graveyard - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
