As the U.S. government begins experimenting with a [[bacteriological weapon]] in a small town in [[Eastern Europe]], a disaster occurs in which the weapon spreads its effects on the citizens of the area, turning them into mutated zombies. To [[cover up]] the exposure and make it look like a [[nuclear meltdown]] of an area power station, the U.S. President orders a team of contracted mercenaries to be sent in to wipe out the zombie plague and secure the "accident" while facing off with the zombie horde.
