==Plot==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
This film is allegedly based on the real-life journals of [[Dale S. Rogers]], a man who, in the 1970s, lived along the banks of the [[Navidad River]] in [[Sublime, Texas]] - the same area where [[Wild Man of the Navidad|the original legend of the Wild Man of the Navidad]] surfaced back in the late 1800s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasescapes.com/MurrayMontgomeryLoneStarDiary/Wild-Woman-of-the-Navidad.htm|title=Wild Woman of the Navidad.|website=Texasescapes.com|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildmanofthenavidad.com|title=The Wild Man of the Navidad|website=Wildmanofthenavidad.com|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> The film follows Dale, his wheelchair-using wife Jean, and her oft-shirtless, lazy-eyed caretaker Mario. Though their ranch sits on vast acres prime for paying hunters, Dale has resisted opening up the land because of the strange, [[Bigfoot]]-like creatures supposedly inhabiting it. But after the prodding of some of the rifle-loving townsfolk and the loss of his welding job, Dale gives in and opens the gate to his compound. Then the hunters become the hunted.<ref>[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/blog/2008/04/tribeca-director-interview-justin-meeks.php] {{dead link|date=September 2017}}</ref>

==Production==
The film is a throwback to drive-in [[Sasquatch]] films of the 1970s like ''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]'', and is known for its recreation of their specific vintage style, pacing and feel—from the real-life characters down to the period production design and music.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2008-09-19/674074/|title=Beware: Bigfoot Ahead|first1=Joe|last1=O'Connell|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|accessdate=11 September 2017}}</ref> The film was co-produced by [[Kim Henkel]], co-writer of the original ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' with [[Tobe Hooper]] in 1974 and was written, directed and edited by two of Henkel's screenwriting/production students, [[Justin Meeks]] and [[Duane Graves]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2016-02-26/a-white-knuckle-western/|title=A White-Knuckle Western|last=O'Connell|first=Joe|newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=2016-02-26|accessdate=2016-10-06}}</ref>
