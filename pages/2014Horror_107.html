== Plot ==
Five friends, Scott ([[Zachary Soetenga]]) and his girlfriend Steph ([[Lindsey McKeon]]), Elena ([[Sofia Pernas]]), Trevor ([[Pierson Fode]]) and Charlie (Jamie Anderson) meet in [[Panama]] for vacation. While partying at night, Trevor meets the natives Carmen (Laura Penuela) and Julio (Juanxo Villaverd). Scott becomes interested in exploring the [[Darien Gap]], despite a number of people believing that a group of teenagers were murdered by [[El Chupacabra]] in the area, including Julio who warns the group away from going. However, Carmen tells the group of a beautiful waterfall deep in the jungle and convinces them to hike there.

The following morning, Julio realizes that Carmen has taken the group into the jungle despite his warnings, and sets off to find them. Meanwhile, the group hike far into the jungle to reach the waterfall. After some time, Trevor and Carmen leave the rest of the group to be alone, but begin to hear strange noises in the jungle. While Trevor is investigating, Carmen disappears. They attempt phoning her, but find her phone smashed nearby, before losing service, leaving them stranded in the jungle. As night falls, the group realize that they are being stalked. After catching a glimpse of a wild animal, the group scatter through the jungle in terror, and Charlie is attacked and killed. Elena and Trevor discover the body and run into Scott and Steph. Scott decides to try and reach higher ground in order to get cell-phone service. After leaving the others, Scott records a distress video, hoping it will reach someone who can help. However, he is interrupted by the others screaming and rushes back, only to find a bloodied Trevor, who is quickly dragged away. Scott follows him into a cave where he finds El Chupacabra's lair, then flees and catches up with Steph and Elena.

Trevor awakens in the cave with a broken leg and finds Carmen's mauled body. He attempts to escape from the cave, but is attacked and killed. The following day, Scott's video has been posted on social media and has gone viral, prompting a search and rescue mission by Panama authorities, accompanied by Julio. Having survived the night, Scott, Steph and Elena are once again attacked by El Chupacabra. While running through the jungle, Steph breaks her ankle. Scott stays with Steph while Elena leaves to flag down the attention of an overhead helicopter. However, as the helicopter crew is recording Elena she is attacked by El Chupacabra. Soon afterwards, Scott and Steph are also attacked, but military personnel arrive and shoot El Chupacabra, saving them.
