==Production==
The original script for ''Furnace'' was written by [[Anghus Houvouras]], and the project was brought up to director [[William Butler (actor)|William Butler]], who thought that the story was reminiscent of the 1988 film ''[[Prison (1988 film)|Prison]]''.  Butler signed to direct, and he and his writing partner [[Aaron Strongoni]] collaborated to polish the script to meet Melee Entertainment's budgetary concerns.  The rewriting lasted six months and changed the story substantially.  Butler said of the change, "This of course was no reflection on Anghus, but instead the team of people at Melee that sort of took the film in another direction."<ref name=asylum>{{cite news | author=Phil Davies Brown | url=http://www.horror-asylum.com/interview/williambutler/interview.asp | title=William Butler | publisher=Horror Asylum | date=2007-08-09 | accessdate=2007-12-16 }}</ref>
