===Review===
{{quote|Bartok, who wrote all four episodes as well as the wraparound segments (which was directed by Joe Dante), certainly has an enthusiasm for the underused subgenre {{sic}} that is the horror anthology, but as a first time writer, is unable to deliver a knockout here. While each director does a descent job with the material they are given, the stories themselves are uneven and lack the power they need to propel from one to the next. The stand out episode is "Jibaku" with its interpretation of Japanese Hell and usage of animation, while "Stanley’s Girlfriend" has slow burning mood and subtle punch line but feels out of place amongst the others. "The Girl with the Golden Breast" essentially exists for Rachel Veltri to show off her ample boobs, while "My Twin, the Worm" is practically ruined by embarrassing CGI, especially given its director's resume.

The material would feel much more satisfying in a television horror anthology instead of a movie, so that each segment could either be appreciated or written off independent of one another. The stories have a small screen appeal, and with their zinger endings and dark humor, would have been welcome on the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales From The Crypt]]'' TV series. This comparison is made all the stronger by the elderly guide who pushes each of the tourists to tell a story, while the twisty-winding rooms and hallways of the haunted mansion seal the deal.|Ryan Midnight, Geeks of Doom<ref>{{cite web|last1=Midnight|first1=Ryan|title=DVD Review: Trapped Ashes|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2008/08/31/dvd-review-trapped-ashes|website=Geeks of Doom|publisher=geeksofdoom.com|accessdate=27 January 2016|date=31 August 2008}}</ref>}}
