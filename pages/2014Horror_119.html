==Synopsis==
Stuart ([[Robert Englund]]) is a film purist who despises the current film world, viewing it as vulgar and cheap. After being laid-off from his job as a projectionist and forced to work at the concession stand, Stuart decides to take his revenge. Stuart manages to capture Martin ([[Finn Jones]]) and Allie ([[Emily Berrington]]), a young couple who have come to his theatre to watch ''[[The Hills Have Eyes 2]]'' and make out. After drugging Allie and incapacitating his manager, Stuart traps the couple in the theatre overnight. He then proceeds to use the building's [[CCTV]] system and a handheld camcorder to make his own personal horror movie.

Does for multiplexes what Jaws did for water.".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Andrew|title=STARBURST REVIEW|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/9339-dvd-review-the-last-showing|publisher=Starburst Magazine|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and ''Grolsch Film Works'' both panned the movie,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=FRIGHTFEST 2014: THE LAST SHOWING|url=http://grolschfilmworks.com/ca/reviews/frightfest-2014-the-last-showing|publisher=Grolsch Film Works|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> which ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt "has a strong pulpy premise, but ultimately lacks the sly humor and jolting shock value required to make it come alive on screen".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Stephen|title='The Last Showing': FrightFest Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/last-showing-frightfest-review-726999|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>
