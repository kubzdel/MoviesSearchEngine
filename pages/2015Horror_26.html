'''''Bite''''' is a 2015 [[Body horror|body horror film]] by Canadian writer/director [[Chad Archibald]], produced by [[Black Fawn Films]], and [[Breakthrough Entertainment]] about a young woman who is bitten by a waterborne insect while in Costa Rica and suffers horrifying consequences.

==Plot==
Casey (played by Elma Begovic) returns home from her bachelorette party in Costa Rica with a seemingly innocuous insect bite but is too preoccupied with her issues at home to take note. An over-bearing mother-in-law, and cold feet over her impending wedding are at the top of her list of concerns but the horrifying effects of the bite are the one thing she will not be able to escape from as her instincts take a turn for the murderous and her body degenerates into an insectoid form.

==Reception==
The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics and holds a 43% Rating on RottenTomatoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bite_2016/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610195251/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bite_2016 |archivedate=10 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }} </ref> The beginning of the film and character development in particular were criticized, with the relationships and acting being described as unconvincing and generic to the point of being parodic, while the complex themes and body-horror elements were generally viewed more favorably by critics, Brian Tallerico from [[RogerEbert.com]] called it "one of those early career horror entries in which the filmmakers don’t quite nail the set-up or the landing, but the gooey center of the film works for those with a high tolerance for things that might make a majority of the population queasy."<ref>{{cite web|last=Tallerico |first=Brian |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bite-2016 |title=Bite Movie Review & Film Summary (2016) |publisher=Roger Ebert |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}</ref>

Phil Wheat from Nerdly had a slightly more positive takeaway after seeing the Frightfest 2015 screening: "''Bite'' is strange and claustrophobic tale of sexuality, horror and bodily fluids recalls the best of [[David Cronenberg]] ([[Rabid (film)|''Rabid'']], [[Shivers (film)|''Shivers'']], [[The Fly (1986 film)|''The Fly'']]), even echoing of [[Roman Polanski]]’s [[Repulsion (film)|''Repulsion'']] in the isolated madness of Casey’s condition. And as such is unmissable"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/08/31/frightfest-2015-bite-review/ |title=Frightfest 2015: ‘Bite’ Review |publisher=Nerdly |date=2015-08-31 |accessdate=2016-11-23}}</ref> and Matt Boiselle from Dread Central stated that "''Bite'' definitely has the chops to be the Fly of the new age and simply shouldn’t be missed, especially if you’re a gorehound on the prowl."<ref>{{cite web|last=Boiselle |first=Matt |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/115542/bite-2015/ |title=Bite (2015) |publisher=Dread Central |date=2015-07-28 |accessdate=2016-11-23}}</ref>

Many audience members were apparently unprepared for the gruesome content of the film however, as Fantasia Film Festival co-director Mitch Davis said on Facebook, "I leave the BITE premiere for all of ten minutes and the following text lights up my phone: "2 people fainted. One girl is puking and another hit his head on stairs". Truth." Davis also had special ''Bite'' branded barf-bags handed out to the audience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton |first=Steve |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/117170/bite-screening-spews-bodily-fluids-at-fantasia/ |title=Bite Screening Spews Bodily Fluids at Fantasia |publisher=Dread Central |date=2015-08-04 |accessdate=2016-11-23}}</ref>
