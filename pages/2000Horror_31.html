==Critical response==
''Fatally Yours'' offered in their review that [the film] "is straight up one of the best Full Moon Entertainment movies out there for sure", praising the director and casting. They concluded by remarking that while the film might "seem like your typical cheesy horror film it does have its memorable moments that make you happy to be able to be viewing it."<ref name="fatallyyours"/>  ''Beyond Hollywood'' wrote that the film began with "the biggest cliche' of movie cliche's" in that the protagonists were themselves filmmakers filming a horror movie scene as part of the horror movie itself. They made note of the low budget and that the film was no exception to films of this genre not being known for presenting great acting, underscoring that the first 20 minutes were "excruciatingly bad", though granting that the acting did get better, leading the reviewer to suppose that the project was possibly shot in the same order as scripted, allowing the actors to become more comfortable with their characters as the film progressed.<ref name="beyondhollywood"/>  ''eFilmCritic'' found the film to be "easily one of the absolute worst films to ever smudge a rental store shelf", opining that the film's script was cliche' and unoriginal, the pacing would "cause even snails to squirm with impatience", and concluding the review by writing the film was "horribly directed, horribly shot, and just plain horribly executed."<ref name="efilmcritic"/>  Mike Bracken of [[IGN]] wrote, "Ultimately, this is one of the better zombie flicks to come along in awhile".<ref name=ign/>  Glenn Kay wrote that the film is enthusiastic, but "most viewers will agree that the living hate ''The Dead Hate the Living!''"<ref name=kay/>
