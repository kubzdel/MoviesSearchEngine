'''''Alone in the Dark II''''' is a 2008 German-American [[horror film]] starring [[Rick Yune]], [[Rachel Specter]] and [[Lance Henriksen]]. The film was directed by [[Peter Scheerer]] and [[Michael Roesch]]. It is a [[sequel]] to [[Uwe Boll]]'s 2005 film ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', although it features an entirely new cast and a story that is unrelated to the original film.

''Alone in the Dark II'' was filmed in New York City and Los Angeles. It is loosely based on the [[Infogrames]]' ''[[Alone in the Dark]]'' video game series.

Reviewing the film for ''[[IGN]]'', R.L. Shaffer wrote: "[[Uwe Boll]]'s ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'' did not require a sequel. Critics hated the film. Fans hated the film. ... Thankfully though, ''Alone in the Dark II'' is actually a much better film than the first. It's a touch light on action, and the setting is far more limited in terms of production design, but the tone is a little more in keeping with the ideas of the game franchise. ... Look at ''Alone in the Dark II'' more as a reboot than a sequel and it plays OK."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/25/alone-in-the-dark-ii-dvd-review|title=Alone in the Dark II DVD Review|first=R.
