'''''1920''''' is a 2008 Indian [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Vikram Bhatt]]. Filmed in [[Hindi]], the plot revolves around the events surrounding a married couple living in a haunted house in the year 1920. The film stars debutant actors [[Rajneesh Duggal]] and [[Adah Sharma]] as the married couple, along with [[Indraneil Sengupta]] in a special role. Loosely inspired by the 1973 horror film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', it is the first installment of the [[1920 (film series)|''1920'' film series]], which was a commercial success. The film was also dubbed into [[Telugu language|Telugu]], under the title ''1920 Gayathri''. A sequel, ''[[1920: The Evil Returns]]'', was released in 2012 to mixed reviews and commercial success.

==Plot==
In the year 1920 at [[Palampur]], India, an architect arrives at a large [[manor house]]. The manager of the mansion, MK, discusses how its owner wishes to have it torn down with a hotel constructed in its place. Later that night, the architect is killed by a mysterious force. It turns out the first architect who had come before him was also killed in a similar manner some time ago.

Now the third architect who is brought in, Arjun Singh, is a religious, true devotee of lord Hanumaan and devoted to his family; but he is also in love with Lisa. This meets strong disapproval from his family because Lisa (born of a [[British people|British]] father and an [[Indian people|Indian]] mother) is of mixed faith. Arjun decides to marry Lisa anyway. As he travels to [[Mumbai]], his father and his brothers intercept his car, beat him up, and try to burn Lisa alive. Arjun fights back and decides to disavow his faith and his family for Lisa. He ultimately becomes an [[atheist]].

The project of the manor house is handed to Arjun's firm, and Arjun and Lisa arrive at the house soon after. Arjun is unaware of the strange things happening, such as objects moving by themselves, but Lisa senses a malevolent presence. She questions Balwant, the caretaker, but he feigns ignorance. Balwant privately pleads with MK to relieve Arjun and Lisa of the project for it will claim their lives just as it killed the others before them. The mansion does not wish to be destroyed, and that is why it reacts to anyone who wants to tear it down, including MK. Balwant himself is unharmed because he is only acting on orders and does not carry an intent to destroy the house. MK is aware of the evil presence but silences Balwant with a bribe.

Arjun leaves for [[Delhi]] on a business trip, leaving Lisa alone in the house. She experiences stronger supernatural events, and confides in a local church priest, Father Thomas. The priest arrives at the mansion and immediately senses a strong evil presence. Later that evening, in his church rooms, he wakes up to find a [[Sigil of Baphomet|Baphomet]] drawn in blood on a wall. He consults with the head priest and they quickly conclude that an evil spirit resides in the mansion and is specifically targeting Lisa. The priest returns to issue a stern warning for Lisa. Lisa is away, and Balwant takes the message, but does not mention it to Lisa.

Arjun returns as Lisa becomes ill, refuses food and water and takes to bed. Arjun spots her eating a dead animal that night, but is unable to make sense of it. The priest attempts to place a cross on Lisa, who turns violent and attacks the priest. Arjun engages a doctor but it turns out to be fruitless as Lisa's evil outbursts and [[telekinetic]] attacks simply overwhelm the hospital staff. Now convinced of a supernatural presence, Arjun storms into MK's office and demands the truth. MK reveals the name of the previous owner of the mansion, Radhama, and Arjun visits her in Nawanagar.

Radhama reveals that it started in 1857, during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Revolt of 1857]], when she was a servant at the mansion. The owner had gone to fight the British and she was left alone in the large mansion with her mother and the owner's daughter, Gayatri. A wounded mutineer, Mohan Kant, sought cover at the mansion but turned out to be a spy for the British forces. He killed Radhama's mother which was later discovered by her. Gayatri sent Radhama with a letter to where her father was. Gayatri, seduced Mohan Kant to buy time until her father who was also a freedom fighter arrived. Her father and his men hanged him. He died looking Gayatri in the eye and vowing revenge. His soul has remained in the mansion ever since. Gayatri died on 18 November 1896, and Lisa was born the same day.

At the mansion, the soul of the treasonous soldier has now completely possessed Lisa's body. The priest decides to perform an exorcism. The ritual begins well, but the evil soul is too powerful for the inexperienced priest, and the priest and Balwant are both killed. The evil spirit impels Lisa to slit her wrists. so as to die, and eject her soul from her body so he can carry her soul with him to hell. Unable to physically restrain Lisa, Arjun is forced to reexamine his lost faith. Lisa, empowered by the evil soul, beats Arjun badly and emotionally tortures him. Soon Arjun feels that only God can save Lisa.

Arjun limps toward Lisa, embraces her with all his might and begins reciting the [[Hanuman Chalisa]], torturing the evil spirit. He tries to run but Arjun holds Lisa's body tightly. After some time, the spirit is in pain from the words and is finally expelled from Lisa's body and destroyed. Finally, Arjun and Lisa embrace each other happily and Gayatri's portrait is removed and sent away from the mansion. Arjun is showed saying that the three, Arjun, Gayatri and Lisa, have completed their task which god gave them.

==Production==
Director [[Vikram Bhatt]]'s previous films ''[[Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage]]'' (2002), ''[[Deewane Huye Paagal]]'' (2005) and ''[[Life Mein Kabhie Kabhiee]]'' were termed as box-office failures in the media.

For scouting for an appropriate location for filming, the production house hired six location managers who visited about 12 countries over a period of six months before settling down on [[Allerton Castle]], [[North Yorkshire]], England. When Bhatt saw the images of this house, he was convinced that it would be the real protagonist of his film.<ref name="house1">{{Cite web|url=http://entertainment.in.msn.com/bollywood/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1661406|title=Haunted house the real protagonist in '1920'|date=8 September 2008|work=India Syndicate|publisher=[[MSN]] India|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910081259/http://entertainment.in.msn.com/bollywood/article.aspx?cp-documentid=1661406| archivedate= 10 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080912/harplus1.htm|title=Movies This Week |last=Pal|first=Dharam|date=12 September 2008|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|accessdate=12 September 2008}}</ref><ref name="rediff_review">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/12bhatt.htm|title=1920 is disastrously boring|last=Sen|first=Raja|date=12 September 2008|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=12 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914123351/http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/12bhatt.htm| archivedate= 14 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> This mansion was owned by a billionaire,who lived with his wife and he killed a carpenter.

To achieve this, instead of resorting to [[computer graphics]], he asked Anjorie Alag, the supporting actress to pose for five hours in front of an artist.<ref name="anjorie">{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/41221.html|title=For 1920, Vikram Bhatt made Anjorie pose for 5 hours|date=2 September 2008|publisher=Indiaglitz.com|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080909224259/http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/41221.html| archivedate= 9 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The entire shoot was completed in a 12-hour night shift for 18 days during the winter.<ref name="bhatt1"/>

To further enhance the effect of horror for this film, Ashoke Chowdhury and Indraneil Roy were hired to work on the [[visual effects]]. When they approached Bhatt and showed him samples of their previous work, they were hired with the instructions that he expected good, international quality work. During their work, the film was treated digitally using a specialized software. Using this, they were able to make glasses break and generate smoke. They made use of techniques such as [[Munsell color system#Chroma|chroma]], [[rotoscoping]] and wire-rigs for levitation. One of their most challenging scenes in the film was to recreate [[Mumbai]]'s [[Victoria Terminus]] as it was in 1920. This required them 40 days of work.<ref name="VFX">{{Cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/09slide1.htm|title=Making 1920 scary!|last=Nithya|first=Ramani|date=9 September 2008|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912012156/http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/09slide1.htm| archivedate= 12 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Several scenes within the movie are identical to scenes in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', ''[[Stigmata (film)|Stigmata]]'' and ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]''.

While [[Adnan Sami]] composed the music for the film, [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]] penned the lyrics. [[Pandit Jasraj]], [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Parveen Sultana]], [[Asha Bhosle]] and [[Kailash Kher]] feature in the soundtrack.<ref name="bhatt1"/>

==Release==
A coffee-table book, with trivia and in-depth detail about the film, was launched prior to the film's release.
