'''''The Lure''''' ({{lang-pl|'''Córki dancingu'''}} – "The Daughters of Dance Party") is a 2015 Polish [[Horror film|horror]] [[musical film]] directed by [[Agnieszka Smoczyńska]]. It tells of two [[mermaid]]s who emerge from the waters and perform in a nightclub. One falls in love with a man, and gives up her tail, but loses her voice in the process. The story is a reworking of ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], with inspiration from Smoczyńska's experiences.

After a Polish premiere, the film screened at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]] and [[Fantasia Film Festival]], to mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Some time in the 1980s, two mermaids, Golden and Silver, encounter a rock band, Figs n' Dates, relaxing and playing music on a beach in [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]. They accompany the band back to the nightclub where they regularly perform and begin playing gigs there, performing as [[striptease|strippers]] and backup singers. The mermaids soon become their own act, The Lure, with the band backing them. Golden murders a bar patron after a show one night and continues to thirst for blood; Silver falls in love with the bassist Mietek, but Mietek only sees her as a fish and not a woman.

Golden meets [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]], a fellow sea creature and singer of a [[metal band]], who informs her that if her sister falls in love and her love marries someone else, she will turn into sea foam; if she is to have her tail removed, she will lose her voice. When Golden's murder victim is discovered, one of the bandmates punches Silver and Golden, and it appears that they die. The bandmates roll their bodies in carpets and throw them into the river. But they return to the club, alive, and the band apologizes. Silver has her tail surgically replaced with a pair of legs to make Mietek love her back, but this makes her lose her singing voice. She tries to have sex with her new lower-half, but Mietek is disgusted when she gets blood on him from her surgery scars.

Mietek later meets a woman in a recording studio, whom he marries. The sisters attend the reception; Golden and Triton warn Silver that she must eat Mietek before daybreak or she will become sea foam. Silver dances with Mietek, but cannot bring herself to eat him, and turns into sea foam in his arms. Distraught, Golden tears Mietek's throat out and returns to the ocean in full view of the entire wedding party.

Director [[Agnieszka Smoczyńska]] called the film a "[[coming of age film|coming-of-age story]]", echoing her own youth. She recalled that her mother ran a nightclub, where she had her "first shot of vodka, first cigarette, first sexual disappointment and first important feeling for a boy." The mermaids were an abstraction that allowed her to tell her story without revealing too much of herself.<ref>{{cite web| title='It Is in Huge Part My Own Story': Director Agnieszka Smoczynska, The Lure | url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/97088-it-is-in-huge-part-my-own-story-director-agnieszka-smoczynska-the-lure/ | author=Rezayazdi, Soheil |date=27 January 2016 | accessdate=22 June 2016 | work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]}}</ref> The screenwriter Robert Bolesto sought to write a story based on two friends of his that frequented nightclubs in the 80s, which enthused Smoczyńska and resonated with her own childhood.<ref name=hartwich16/>

Smoczyńska also wanted the film to be a retelling of ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]],<ref name=hartwich16>{{cite web | title=On the trail of two mermaids – Interview: Agnieszka Smoczyńska • Director | url=http://www.cineuropa.org/ff.aspx?t=ffocusinterview&l=en&tid=2936&did=304158 | work=Cineuropa Film focus | author=Hartwich, Dorota | date=25 January 2015 | accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> and developed her idea of mermaids from tales of the 14th–16th century that described them as the sisters of dragons, and hence made them part monstrous.<ref name=ramji16/> She invented their need to feed on human hearts and that propensity to attack the larynx of their victims.<ref name=timpone16>{{cite web | title=Q&A: Director Agnieszka Smoczynska on the Lore of THE LURE | author =Timpone, Tony | url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-director-agnieszka-smoczynska-on-the-lore-of-the-lure/ | work=Fangoria | date=5 May 2016 | accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>

===Themes===
Smoczyńska likened the mermaids to immigrants, abused by the locals (used in the sex industry) on their way to their real goal—America. She added they represent innocence, yet their odour and slime recalled girls maturing, "they menstruate, they ovulate, their bodies start smelling and feeling different."<ref name=ramji16/> David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]], noting the mermaids' "bodies are a source of constant fascination", said that "''The Lure'' is having some fun with chauvinist objectification; the film has a funny habit of lambasting dumb misogynist rhetoric by applying it literally."<ref name="Indiewire">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/the-lure-polish-mermaid-musical-review-1201709567/ |title=Review: ‘The Lure’ Is The Best Goth Musical About Man-Eating Mermaids Ever Made |last=Ehrlich |first=David |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=4 August 2017 |work=[[IndieWire]]}}</ref>

===Critical response===
The film had a mixed reception in Poland.<ref name="Variety2"/> On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 56 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''The Lure'' adds a sexually charged, genre-defying twist to well-established mermaid lore, more than overpowering its flaws through sheer variety and wild ambition."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lure_2017 |title=Lure (Córki dancingu) (2017) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-lure |title=The Lure Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>

Rubina Ramji, film editor and reviewer for the ''Journal of Religion and Film'', described the film as a "rock opera, a horror movie and fairytale story about mermaids all rolled up into one".<ref name=ramji16>{{cite journal | author=Ramji, Rubina |year=2016|title=An Interview with Agnieszka Smoczynska, Director of The Lure | journal=Journal of Religion & Film|volume= 20 | issue= 2| url=http://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1404&context=jrf }}</ref> Guy Lodge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised it for its originality, describing it as "never less than arresting, and sometimes even a riot". However, he felt the screenplay lacked ideas in portraying the mermaids' vampiric attributes, and was unsure of the film's 1980s setting and whether it alluded to the politics of the time.<ref name="Variety2"/> IndieWire critic David Ehrlich gave it a B+, calling it "the best goth musical about man-eating mermaids ever made".<ref name="Indiewire"/>
