== Plot ==
{{more plot|date=April 2017}}
Slacker James and his friends spend their days abusing alcohol and drugs and their nights at various parties. He moves through his life with a sense of boredom until he meets Sara, a college student seeking enlightenment from drugs. Knowing that this would prove harmful to her, James tries to dissuade Sara from this idea but is ultimately unsuccessful. As she becomes more and more addicted to drugs, Sara becomes obsessed with the idea of Toad Road, a road in [[York, Pennsylvania]], that possesses seven gates rumored to lead directly to Hell. Legends state that each gate, once passed, cause increasing disorientation and eventual loss of self.

She persuades James to join her in an excursion to Toad Road, where the two take [[Acid (drug)|acid]] and eventually become separated. James ends up passing out and upon waking, finds that six months have passed since he and Sara went to Toad Road. She has been reported as missing and he is considered to be a [[person of interest]] in her disappearance.  While he was missing, his friends have returned home, and he no longer has a place to stay.  He moves into a shack owned by his uncle, and, pressed for details by the police and locals, turns to self-destructive activities, such as encouraging people to beat him up.  Battered and feeling guilty about Sara's disappearance, he is haunted by visions of Sara.  James asks her if he is responsible for her disappearance, but he receives no answer.
