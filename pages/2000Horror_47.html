{{nihongo|'''''Junk'''''|JUNK 死霊狩り|Junk Shiryōgari}} is a Japanese [[Yakuza]] [[Zombie]] movie directed by Atsushi Muroga. Shot in 1999 and produced by [[Japan Home Video]], it is essentially a remake of a Japanese mafia movie called "Score" also directed by Muroga, but this time with zombies getting in the way of being paid for the heist. The movie pays homage to [[Re-Animator]], [[Reservoir Dogs]] (just as "Score" did), and the original [[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]. It stars [[Kaori Shimamura]], Yuji Kisimoto, Nobuyuki Asano, Tate Gouta, and Osamu Ebara. It is released in North America by [[Unearthed Films]].
