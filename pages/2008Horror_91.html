==Reception==
Dr. Nathan of ''Quiet Earth'' said, "This truly disturbing movie, written and directed by Christopher Denham, is thus far the only TAD premiere Dr Nathan has experienced which actually, really gave me that deep-down visceral sense of dread and foreboding."<ref>[[Quiet Earth]], by Dr. Nathan (October 24, 2008), [http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2008/10/24/TAD-08-Review-of-Christopher-Denhams-HOME-MOVIE "TAD 08: Review of Christopher Denham's HOME MOVIE"], Quietearth.us, accessed 12-30-2008</ref> From Dread Central: "There’s something about home videos that brings out the worst in people. I hadn’t thought of it for years, but after seeing Christopher Denham’s disturbing Home Movie, I remembered my very own forays into family camcording", "... is better written, more realistic and more disturbing than the forefather of the modern found footage horror movie, ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''. In fact, ''Home Movie'' might just be the tautest, best acted, most tightly written and disturbing “found film” ever made!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/home-movie-2008 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006174445/http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/home-movie-2008 |archivedate=2008-10-06 |df= }} </ref>
