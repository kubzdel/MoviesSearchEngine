Director and writer [[Sion Sono]] was influenced by Japanese crime cases while developing ''Cold Fish'', specifically about an actual killing spree committed by a dog kennel owner in the 1980s (the story of the film involves a family of three that becomes entangled in a string of ongoing murders perpetrated by a tropical fish salesman in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]).<ref name="tokyorepoerter" /> Sono also wanted to "depict a sense of total hopelessness" which he felt is "lacking in Japanese films."<ref name="tokyorepoerter">{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2010/11/28/sion-sonos-cold-fish-nets-japan-premiere-at-tokyo-filmex/|work=The Tokyo Reporter|author=CJ|title=Sion Sono’s ‘Cold Fish’ nets Japan premiere at Tokyo Filmex|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==
Film Business Asia gave ''Cold Fish'' an 8 out of 10 rating praising the actor Denden who without his "tour-de-force performance...''Cold Fish'' may never have worked."<ref name="fba-review" /> The review went on to state that "Though there's considerable gore on display, it's largely cartoonish. ''Cold Fish'' is not so much a blood-and-guts horror movie, more a danse macabre about social breakdown."<ref name="fba-review" />

In the United Kingdom, ''[[Total Film]]'' gave the film a three out of five rating, suggesting that plot twists and black comedy offered welcome reprieve from the "largely hysterical acting and rivers of viscera."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/cold-fish?ns_campaign=reviews&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=totalfilm&ns_linkname=0&ns_fee=0 |work=[[Total Film]] |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |date=April 13, 2011 |title= Cold Fish |last= Harley |first=Kevin}}</ref>
''[[The Guardian]]'' found the film to be "fairly ordinary" in comparison to Sono's other works and felt that the film was too long.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/10/cold-fish-review-shion-sono?INTCMP=SRCH |work= [[The Guardian]] |title= Cold Fish – review |last= French |first= Philip |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |date= April 10, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, praising the acting from Denden, Fukikoshi and Kurosawa and Shinya Kimura's photography and Takashi Matsuzuka's production design which made up for "some overindulgent directorial moments".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.radiotimes.com/servlet_film/com.icl.beeb.rtfilms.client.simpleSearchServlet?searchTypeSelect=5&frn=50703 |work= [[Radio Times]] |title= Cold Fish |accessdate= July 11, 2011 |author= Parkinson, David}}</ref>
