==Plot==
Two high-school-aged sisters, Stacey and Emma, have recently been moved by their parents to a suburban area in California. Emma struggles to integrate into the community. Stacey quickly makes new friends and has a local boyfriend, CJ.

Emma befriends Evan, her neighbor, with the help of her sister, and the two begin to bond over the issues each has within their own family. Evan’s mother is deceased, and his father, Bill, is a rude and awkward man who embarrasses Evan. Emma’s parents have a strained relationship, and her mother is out of town. 

Emma’s friend Tara begins displaying unusual behavior at school, eating constantly and coughing up blood. She eventually collapses in the school parking lot after fleeing her classroom. Emma and another local boy find her in a seizure like state and Emma runs to get help. Before she can arrive, Tara seemingly comes to, but immediately vomits blood all over the boy who stayed with her. 

Tara is hospitalized and Emma is unable to reach her. The news begins reporting that “worm flu” has begun to spread to their area of California. Emma’s father leaves to retrieve their mother from the airport, but quickly finds himself shut off from the children by the government. A quarantine is placed on the town and no one can enter or leave. 

Not recognizing the danger of their situation, Stacey decides to attend a party at a local construction site. Emma tags along after Stacey engineers a “date” with Evan for her by stealing her phone and sending texts to him under Emma’s identity. At the party, CJ cheats on Stacey with another girl, and Emma and Evan are interrupted during a romantic moment by an attack on the party. The same boy that Tara vomited blood on has become sick and attacks the partygoers. He displays extreme aggression and in the chaos, the sisters are left trapped in the partially built home with the infected boy. While attempting to flee, Stacey is infected with vomited blood from the boy. Before he can also infect Emma, Evan arrives and incapicitates him with a blow to the head. The trio flee the party and Evan returns home. 

The CDC begins dropping off food and disaster supplies to each home, and strict instructions are provided by the military. Armed troops begin conducting routine patrols to town. Anyone caught infected is taken into custody, and their families are left inside their homes. Martial law is enacted, and it becomes a felony to confine an infected person. Emma finds clips online claiming that infected appear able to communicate with each other by unspoken means.

The CDC arrives once again and interviews everyone in each residence, asking if anyone has come into contact with infected people. Both sisters lie to protect Stacey. Despite this, Stacey begins exhibiting signs of infection shortly after the visit. A disturbing growth forms at the base of her neck, and she becomes ravenously hungry. The girls’ father is able to call them, and instructs Stacey to retrieve a handgun he keeps in his closet and to lock down the house. The two try to leave town, but are stopped by armed soldiers maintaining the quarantine. A truck attempts to ram the barricade of soldiers. The soldiers kill the occupant in a hail of gunfire. Fleeing the carnage, they return home.

Later that night, Evan runs to their home and begins banging on the door, screaming that he is being chased by an infected person. Emma lets him inside against the objections of the terrified Stacey. Upon entering the home, Evan says his father is sick and is after him. Bill approaches the home and tries to force himself inside. Unable to get through the door, he vomits blood into the peephole when Emma looks through it, but she is shielded by the glass. Bill begins to wander around the yard. Evan takes the gun and attempts to track his father’s movements through the curtained windows, but Bill smashes through a glass door and slams into Evan, knocking the gun away. 

Evan crawls away and is able to warn the girls that the infected are blind, and hunt by sound. Bill begins to stalk the room, but everyone remains quiet enough to avoid detection. Emma is trapped between a wall and Bill. A number of worms begin crawling out of Bill’s ears, one of which prods Emma, indicating to it that she is close. Just as Bill goes to vomit blood, Stacey shoots him in the head, killing him. She then collapses and experiences a seizure, but a germ mask she is wearing prevents her from vomiting blood onto Emma or Evan.

Emma confines her sister to her room, shutting her in by nailing boards across the doorframe. Evan hears on a crank radio the CDC provided that the military is preparing to bomb any residences where multiple infected are found, which they locate by detecting the immense body heat they produce with heat sensitive cameras mounted to aircraft. Emma refuses to feed Stacey, believing that by doing so, she can stall the growth of the parasitic worms taking her over. Stacey claims the worms tell her to do bad things and becomes unhinged. 

CJ arrives to collect her so they can skip town together, claiming that the Army has abandoned their barricades. He finds Stacey locked in her room, who lies and tells him the other two are infected and that they locked her up. When he reaches for her hand, she pulls him partially into the room and devours his entire arm, killing him. 

Evan finds the carnage, and Emma decides to try to remove the parasite with the same technique one uses to remove a botfly. By covering the growth the parasite lives in on Stacey’s neck, she begins to suffocate it, prompting it to come to the surface of the skin so that she can remove it. Emma drugs Stacey to render her unconscious, and the operation is successful. Stacey tears the parasite fully out of her neck, which Evan stomps to death. 

Believing her to be cured, Emma lets her sister come back out of her room. However, Stacey begins exhibiting symptoms again, but flees the home with the group’s food rather than attack them. Emma pursues her sister to a nearby home, and Evan follows. 

The Army begins bombing any homes where infected are picked up by camera. Once inside the home, Emma discovers the original occupants dead from suicide. The home is eerily quiet, and neither can find Stacey. Searching the house, they are horrified by the discovery of a large number of infected in the garage. Emma witnesses the infected gathered around Tara, with an enormous number of worms being pumped into her mouth by the others. Evan accidentally makes the infected aware of their presence by stepping on a toy car. Forced to flee from the garage, they are unable to get back outside through the front door, as the entire home is packed with infected. Climbing upstairs, Emma finds Stacey in a bedroom struggling to maintain her sanity against the recurring infection. There was more than one worm in each person, and the removal did nothing but buy her time as a new one grew to replace the original. 

Stacey begs Emma to kill her and Evan barricades the room against the encroaching infected downstairs. Emma can not bring herself to kill Stacey, until Stacey shows a large number of worms in her mouth and prepares to vomit on her. Emma shoots Stacey and collapses from the trauma. Evan is able to get her back up and the two flee outside a window. They jump into a pool in the backyard, and the water protects them as the Army drops a payload on the house, which explodes behind them. Waiting for the firestorm to pass, the two resurface and leave the area.

Emma heads to the gas station her father called her from and finds a photograph of the family, with a note on the back. It says to meet him and their mother at her uncle’s residence in Washington state. Evan takes a vacant car from the gas station and the two depart for Washington to find Emma’s parents.
