== Reception ==
[[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' named it the 9th best film of 2011 <ref>[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2011/12/richard-brody-the-best-in-film.html The 26 Best Films of 2011]</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that the film "probably contains Swanberg's clearest exposition of his philosophy, yet its sad aimlessness, from the mouth of an unhappy director (played by the helmer), elicits only a begrudging pity."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117944590/ |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]|date=February 13, 2011 |location=Berlin |title=Silver Bullets |first= Jay |last=Weissberg}}</ref> A review in ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' stated that "Silver Bullets’ introspection feels earned", but that the film "splinters into an ending that isn’t entirely satisfying, though a prologue and epilogue suggest these issues of control and the line between pretense and reality continue throughout one’s creative life" and gave a "B+" grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/silver-bullets,64051/ |accessdate=2012-09-03|title=Silver Bullets review |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=October 27, 2011 |last=Willmore |first=Alison}}</ref> A ''New York Times'' reviewer concluded that the film "neither pleases the eye nor stimulates the mind. At one point Mr. Swanberg’s character announces that he couldn’t care less about getting good reviews. Whew, I feel so much better."<ref>{{cite web |title=Independent Filmmaker Fights That Old Ennui|work= New York Times |date=October 27, 2011 |first=Jeannette |last=Catsoulis|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/movies/silver-bullets-written-and-directed-by-joe-swanberg-review.html |accessdate=2012-09-03}}</ref>
