'''''Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV''''' is a 2000 American [[Superhero film|superhero]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[Splatter film|splatter]] film directed by [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and written by Kaufman, [[Michael Herz (producer)|Michael Herz]], Patrick Cassidy, [[Trent Haaga]], and uncredited co-director Gabriel Friedman. Despite being the third [[sequel]] to ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'', [[Stan Lee]]'s opening narration claims that ''Citizen Toxie'' is, in fact, the official sequel to the first film, disacknowledging the events of the first two sequels.

==Plot==
When the notorious Diaper Mafia take hostage the Tromaville School for the Very Special, only the Toxic Avenger and his morbidly obese sidekick Lardass can save Tromaville. However, an explosion results in some unforeseeable consequences where it creates a dimensional tear between Tromaville and its dimensional mirror image Amortville. While the Toxic Avenger (Toxie) is trapped in Amortville, Tromaville comes under the control of the superhuman powered hero's evil [[doppelg√§nger]] the Noxious Offender (Noxie). With the citizens of Tromaville unaware of the switch, Mayor Goldberg decides to combat "Toxie" by calling in every superhero he can afford. Will Toxie return to Tromaville in time to stop Noxie's rampage or is he doomed to remain a second-class citizen in Amortville forever? How did Toxie's wife Sarah become pregnant with two babies from two different fathers? Will Tito, the Retarded Rebel, ever get over his teen angst and become a productive member of society?

Unlike ''The Toxic Avenger'''s first two sequels, ''[[The Toxic Avenger Part II]]'' and ''[[The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation of Toxie]]'', which both received negative reviews, ''Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV'' received positive reviews and currently has a 67% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toxic_avenger_iv_citizen_toxie/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, "If the take-no-prisoners humor of ''Citizen Toxie'' is very funny, the movie's relentless comic excess is ultimately a little exhausting."<ref>{{cite web|last=Holden|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Holden|title=Citizen Toxie The Toxic Avenger Part IV (2000)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E2DB1130F931A35752C1A9679C8B63|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 2, 2001|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}</ref>
