'''''Evil Dead''''' is a 2013 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Fede Álvarez]] (in his directorial debut), written by Rodo Sayagues and Álvarez and produced by [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Robert Tapert]] and [[Sam Raimi]]. The film was shot in [[New Zealand]] outside of [[Auckland]], lasting about a month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10878484|title=Just how evil is the new Evil Dead?|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=April 19, 2013|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> The fourth installment in the [[Evil Dead|''Evil Dead'' franchise]], it serves as a soft reboot of [[The Evil Dead|the original 1981 film]] and as a continuation to the original film trilogy.

The film had its [[Premiere|world premiere]] at the [[South by Southwest]] festival on March 8, 2013 and was released in the United States on April 5, 2013. It grossed $97 million worldwide.

''Evil Dead'' was announced on July 15, 2013, to be adapted into a live experience as the first maze announced for [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]'s and the second maze for [[Universal Orlando Resort]]'s annual ''[[Halloween Horror Nights]]'' 2013 event.

==Plot==
David and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at a cabin in the woods, where the pair meet up with his younger sister Mia and his friends Eric and Olivia. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her addiction to [[heroin]]. The group discover the cellar, littered with rotting animal corpses, a shotgun, and a book called the ''[[Necronomicon|Naturom Demonto]]''.

Eric, despite written warnings, reads aloud an [[incantation]] and awakens a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing a bloody girl in the woods, and begs the group to leave because she is scared. They refuse, believing that she is simply experiencing the effects of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Mia steals the car keys and drives away from the cabin, but the girl causes her to crash in a swamp. Emerging from the mud, the demonic girl chases Mia through the woods. Mia stumbles into a circular opening to a thorn bush and becomes entangled by possessed vines. The girl, a demonic form of Mia, emits a black tar-like thorn vine from her mouth that slithers into Mia, and possesses her. David and Olivia find Mia and take her back to the cabin.

Later, David finds his murdered dog along with a bloodied hammer, and goes to confront Mia, who is in the shower. In the bathroom, he sees her [[scalding]] herself in the shower. David tries to drive her to a hospital, but heavy rains flood the only road back. Meanwhile, Eric becomes more and more convinced that the book is the cause of all that.

That night, the possessed Mia comes into the living room with a shotgun and shoots David in the arm as a strong wind blows through the cabin, and Mia warns the others that they are all going to die tonight, after which she passes out. David instructs Olivia to get the gun away from Mia, but before she can, Mia wakes up and overpowers her, then projectile [[vomits]] blood all over her face. Olivia manages to shove Mia off, sending her tumbling down into the cellar where she is locked in by Eric. Olivia goes to the bathroom to get a sedative for Mia, but is terrified when she sees her own disfigured reflection in the mirror. Olivia tries to rush back to the others, but becomes frozen and possessed in the process. Eric finds her cutting into her cheek with a mirror shard behind the shower curtain. Olivia attacks and wounds Eric, who grabs a broken piece of the sink and bludgeons her to death. In the shed, David nurses Eric's wounds, and Eric confides that he believes that when he read the book, it released "something evil". Meanwhile, Mia lures Natalie into the cellar, where she bites her hand. Natalie tries to attack Mia with a box cutter, but Mia takes it from her and uses the blade to split her own tongue in half, before planting a bloodied kiss on Natalie's mouth. David opens the trapdoor, interrupting the assault and allowing Natalie to escape. After the demon tells him that Mia no longer exists, he chains it up and locks the cellar door.

Eric explains to David that, according to the ''Naturom Demonto'', the Taker of Souls must claim five [[soul]]s in order to unleash the Abomination. In the kitchen, while cleaning the bite wound, Natalie becomes convinced that her arm is infected and proceeds to amputate it with an electric knife. David does his best to patch up her wounded arm, while Eric continues to explain that Mia must be "purified" either by live burial, bodily dismemberment, or burning. As they debate, the possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David manages to shoot off her remaining arm with the shotgun, snapping her out of her possession but ends up [[Exsanguination|bleeding her to death]] in David's arms.

David plans to burn down the cabin with Mia in it. However, as Mia starts singing a song from their childhood, he has a change of mind and decides to bury her instead. He digs a grave, then enters the cellar to subdue Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes and knocks Mia out, but not before being fatally stabbed and succumbing to his wounds. David proceeds to sedate and bury Mia, unearthing and [[Defibrillation|defibrillating]] her afterwards, which causes the demon to be [[Exorcism|exorcized]] and heals her. The siblings reconcile. As David enters the cabin to retrieve the car keys, a possessed Eric's corpse stabs him in the neck with barb wire cutters. David locks Mia outside and shoots a [[gasoline]] can, destroying Eric's body and killing himself.

With five souls now claimed, the Abomination arises and blood rains from the sky. As Mia battles the Abomination, she is forced to tear her own hand off after it is trapped under a car. She then halves the Abomination with a [[chainsaw]]. Its corpse sinks into the ground and the blood-rain stops. Mia escapes into the woods and wanders off into the distance. Unknown to her, the ''Naturom Demonto'' is still intact.

In a [[post-credits scene]], a silhouetted [[Ash Williams]] says "Groovy" and [[Fourth wall|looks at the camera]] before it cuts to black.

[[Fede Álvarez]] and Rodo Sayagues co-wrote the script, which was then doctored by [[Diablo Cody]] in an effort to Americanize the dialogue since English was not the writers' first language.<ref name="mcintyre1">{{cite news |last=McIntyre |first=Gina |title='Evil Dead' remake: Diablo Cody polishing script for first-time director |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/07/evil-dead-remake-diablo-cody-polishing-script-for-first-time-director.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=July 13, 2011}}</ref>  The film was produced by Raimi, Campbell, and [[Robert Tapert|Robert G.

Raimi and Campbell had planned a remake for many years, but in 2009, Campbell stated the proposed remake was "going nowhere" and had "fizzled" due to extremely negative fan reaction.<ref>[http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/bubba-nosferatu/news/bad-news-no-bubba-nosferatu-good-news-no-evil-dead-remake.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235649/http://www.justpressplay.net/movies/bubba-nosferatu/news/bad-news-no-bubba-nosferatu-good-news-no-evil-dead-remake.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}</ref>  However, in April 2011, Bruce Campbell stated in an AskMeAnything interview on [[Reddit]].com, "We are remaking ''Evil Dead''.

In January 2013, Álvarez commented on the ambiguity of the film's relationship to the original:
{{quote|1=Now, the way I personally like to see ''Evil Dead'' (2013), it's as a story that takes place 30 years after ''The Evil Dead'' ended. The car is there, the cabin is there (a family bought it and did some work on it more than 20 years ago) and the book has found its way back to the cabin... New kids will encounter it and suffer its wrath. Is ''Evil Dead'' a sequel then?  Maybe. But the problem with the sequel theory would be that there are too many coincidences between the events on ''The Evil Dead'' and the ones on ''Evil Dead'' to have happened on a continuous story line [...] But if you believe the Naturom Demonto can force these things to happen... then it could be a sequel... and I do believe in coincidences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/60243|title=Quint visits the set of Evil Dead and holds the book of the dead, sees a ton of gore and even spots a classic cameo!|last=Vespe|first=Eric "Quint"|work=aintitcool.com|date=January 7, 2013|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref>}} Álvarez, who also has a background in [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]], also confirmed in an interview that the film does not employ CGI (except for touch-ups): "We didn't do any CGI in the movie [...] Everything that you will see is real, which was really demanding. This was a very long shoot, 70 days of shooting at night. There's a reason people use CGI; it's cheaper and faster, I hate that. We researched a lot of magic tricks and illusion tricks."<ref>{{cite web |last=Dickson |first=Evan |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3211894/no-cgi-at-all-in-the-new-evil-dead/ |title=No CGI At All In The New 'Evil Dead'?!! |work=Bloody Disgusting |date=January 6, 2013 |accessdate= January 24, 2013}}</ref>

Sam Raimi's 1973 [[Oldsmobile Delta 88]] can be seen in an opening scene with David and Mia as they arrive at the cabin. The 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 has appeared in almost all of the movies that Raimi has been involved with over his career.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Extended cut===
An extended version, that has yet to be released, featuring an alternative ending and various other deleted clips and dialogue, some of which were featured in the original trailer but subsequently removed from the theatrical version, was aired in the UK, on January 25, 2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

No one has yet confirmed whether this was an intentional debut for the anticipated "extended cut", which fans of the film have asked about since the theatrical release, or whether [[StudioCanal UK]] had inadvertently supplied Channel 4 with the wrong copy of the film.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Álvarez has confirmed on Twitter, that the version aired was not the extended cut.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Channel 4 has subsequently confirmed that the wrong copy of the film was supplied to them and that they have sent it back. They added that they have no other information on the version which aired and since the "extended/incorrect" version has been returned to StudioCanal UK they would not be airing it again.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} However, the extended version still airs on [[Film4]]. It was aired again on 13 February 2016, and yet again, on the night of 14 June 2016.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 182 reviews, and an average rating of 6.1/10.  The consensus states: "It may lack the absurd humor that underlined the original, but the new-look ''Evil Dead'' compensates with brutal terror, gory scares, and gleefully bloody violence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_evil_dead_2013/ |title=Evil Dead (2013)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref>  On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{metacritic film|evil-dead-2013|Evil Dead reviews|accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=Evil Dead – CinemaScore|work=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}</ref>

[[Richard Roeper]] rated the film one star out of four, criticizing the film's unoriginality, the characters' lack of intelligence, and the film's reliance on gore for what he felt were cheap scares. He concluded his review by saying, "I love horror films that truly shock, scare and provoke. But after 30 years of this stuff, I'm bored to death and sick to death of movies that seem to have one goal: How can we gross out the audience by torturing nearly every major character in the movie?"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130403/REVIEWS/130409993 |last= Roeper |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Roeper |date= April 3, 2013 |title= Evil Dead' |publisher= rogerebert.com |accessdate= April 5, 2013}}</ref>
