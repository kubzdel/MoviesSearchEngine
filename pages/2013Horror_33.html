It is the sequel to the 2010 film ''[[Birdemic: Shock and Terror]]''.

Shortly into production of ''Sunset Dreams'', a toxic rain falls on Hollywood which causes preserved killer birds and cavemen to emerge from the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and zombies to come to life in a nearby cemetery.

== Reception ==
Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Nguyen's partial self-awareness of his new movie's camp value ... only makes it an effortful, half-understood in-joke rather than the guiltily pleasurable unintentional joke that was ''Birdemic: Shock and Terror''."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-birdemic-2-the-resurrection-1200424321/|title=Film Review: 'Birdemic 2: The Resurrection'|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  Rod Lott of the ''[[Oklahoma Gazette]]'' wrote, "What keeps ''Birdemic 2'' from reaching the first film's level of fun is Nguyen's penchant for treating this go-round like a greatest-hits reel."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://okgazette.com/2013/04/26/birdemic-2-the-resurrection/|title=Birdemic 2: The Resurrection|last=Lott|first=Rod|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|date=2013-04-26|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>  HorrorNews.Net rated it 0/5 stars and called it the worst film of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/73423/film-review-birdemic-2-the-resurrection-2013/|title=Film Review: Birdemic 2: The Resurrection (2013)|work=HorrorNews.Net|date=2013-06-27|accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>

== Potential sequel ==

In a 2016 [[Vice Media|Vice]] interview, Nguyen said that he is hoping to eventually make ''Birdemic 3: Sea Eagle'', which would be his last film.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZoFNVhEfpE The Worst Movie Ever Made? The True Story of 'Birdemic']</ref> In October 2016, an [[Indiegogo]] campaign was raised in order to finance the third film of the series.
