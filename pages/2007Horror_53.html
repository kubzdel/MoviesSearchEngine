==Continuity with ''Food for the Gods''==
This film takes place in the same [[fictional universe]] as H. Scott Hughes's science fiction film ''[[Food for the Gods]]'', set fifty years in the future.  In that film, [[Food for the Gods#Main cast|Dr. Denise Hanson]] is presumed to be granddaughter of Stewart and Terri Hanson, the characters featured in ''Crazy Old Woman''.  Denise Hanson, in ''Food for the Gods'', also meets a fate somewhat similar to her phone dialing ancestor, Crystal.  Writer, [[H. Scott Hughes]] has referred to this as the Hanson Family Curse. The plots are, otherwise, unrelated.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1282034/movieconnections Movie Connections for "Crazy Old Woman" - IMDb]</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1220882/movieconnections Movie Connections for "Food for the Gods" - IMDb]</ref>
