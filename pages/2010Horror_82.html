The title is a homage to the Amicus film ''[[The House That Dripped Blood]]''.

==Plot==
In a movie theater, a mysterious stranger sits next to two girls and starts to tell them a scary story that he claims is true:

Alex moves into an old house at 3 Blood Street. He is excited about moving in, until his friend Thomas points out that the house is dripping blood onto him. Alex is nonchalant about this, saying that it is just the house's paint job, although Thomas observes that nothing is painted this color. They ignore this, but after more blood drips on Alex later, the pair agree to approach the landlord to report the "leak".

The next day, they discover that the landlord's office is vacant, appearing to have not been used in years. Alex finds this odd, saying that the office was open yesterday. Alex hopes the landlord will call him and explain the dripping blood, but starts to worry as the problem continues.

Thomas explains the whole story to his friend Bobby the next day. When Alex meets up with them, Thomas offers Alex a place to stay until the problem stops. Alex declines, saying that he is not going to let some "leak" make him move. Later, Alex goes up to the attic to investigate the source of the blood and discovers his own dead body on the attic floor.

Back at the theater, the stranger finishes his story. The previews start, and the first trailer is for a horror film called "3 Blood Street" that has the same plot as the stranger's story. When the girls look at the stranger, he has become a skeleton, causing the girls to scream.
