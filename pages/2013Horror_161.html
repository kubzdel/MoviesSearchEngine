Drew Hunt from [[Slant Magazine]] gave the film a positive review, writing, "Like ''[[Inland Empire]]'', essentially a three-hour reel of David Lynch’s nightmares, the film is anchored in the sort of dream logic that may only make complete sense to its creator. Reeder’s dogged refusal to allow even the smallest semblance of standard movie comforts—likeable characters, narrative logic, easily identifiable themes—to worm their way into the film may be hubristic, but by that same token, it’s refreshing and revitalizing to watch someone assertively rattle the cages of cinematic form. After all, there’s more than one way to tell a story."<ref name="hunt13">{{cite web |last1=Hunt |first1=Drew |title=The Rambler |url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-rambler |website=Slant Magazine.com |publisher=Drew Hunt |accessdate=7 June 2018}}</ref>
