==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film earned mainly positive reviews from critics. MarBelle of ''short of the week'' gave film the positive review said "The thing about ILSJ—co-written by Susser and David Michôd—is that if you were to strip away the high production values and outlandish world setting, there’d still be at its core a touching age-old story of teen awkwardness in relating to the object of your desire that places our hero Jimbo in the shoes of Kevin Arnold or Dawn Wiener before him, it’s just that their obstacles were slightly less brain hungry."<ref>{{cite web|title=I Love Sarah Jane A TON OF FESTIVAL KUDO’S HAVE POURED IN FOR THIS SPECIAL EFFECTS-LADEN, POST-APOCALYPTIC, ZOMBIE-FILM.
