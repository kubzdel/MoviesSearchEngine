The film premiered at the [[Fantasia Festival]] on July 20, 2014, and at [[SXSW]] on March 13, 2015. It received a theatrical release on April 17, 2015.

A [[Sequel|stand-alone sequel]], ''[[Unfriended: Dark Web]]'', had its premiere on March 9, 2018 at [[SXSW]].

==Plot==
A year ago, high school student Laura Barns commits suicide after an anonymous user uploads a viral video of her passing out and [[defecating]] herself at an unsupervised party. One year later, her former childhood best friend Blaire Lily is chatting with her boyfriend Mitch Roussel on [[Skype]]. Soon after, they are joined by their friends/classmates Jess Felton, Ken Smith, and Adam Sewell and an unknown user named "billie227".

After they invite Val to their chat, Jess's [[Facebook]] page is updated with racy photos of Val at a party. Jess denies uploading the photos and deletes them from her account, but the pictures reappear on Adam's account. They each receive a link of an [[Instagram]] post showing a photo of Val and Laura's messages, with Val telling Laura to kill herself. Val is suddenly brought back into the chat, sitting still next to a bottle of bleach before collapsing. From the police's arrival and voice, they deduce that Val died from a presumed suicide. Ken uses a program to remove "billie227" from the chat, but after they attempt to call the police, the police on the other end implies she is "billie227" and re-enters the chat, revealing a camera view which appears to come from the other side of his room. He approaches the camera source, but his Skype is disconnected and reconnects showing him shredding his hand inside an active blender before using the blades to claw out his throat; killing himself in the process.

"billie227" forces the remaining four to play a game of [[Never Have I Ever]], stating that the loser will die. They are forced to reveal hurtful secrets which reveal their backstabbing against each other.  Blaire and Adam receive messages sent to their printers which they refuse to show to Mitch and Jess. Mitch threatens to leave if Blaire does not show the note; "billie227" warns that Mitch will die if he signs off. In a moment of panic, Blaire shows her paper: "If you reveal this note, Adam will die." Adam shoots himself, revealing the same note except it was for Blaire.

When Blaire convinces Jess not to continue playing, "billie227" cuts the lights in Jess's house and disconnects her video feed. Blaire looks for help on Chatroulette and has a stranger send police to Jess' house. Soon after, Blaire receives a video of Jess with a [[curling iron]] forced down her throat.

"billie227", now revealed to be Laura herself, messages Blaire and Mitch, wanting them to confess who uploaded the video in the first place. Blaire considers denying involvement, but eventually tells her that Mitch was the one who posted it; Mitch grabs a knife and stabs himself in the eye. "billie227" uploads a video which reveals Blaire recorded the defecation video and then Blaire's Facebook friends turn against her. Laura says what Blaire has done will live online forever and wishes she could forgive her, before signing off Skype. Blaire's bedroom door creaks open and a pair of hands slam her laptop shut. Laura's spirit violently lunges at her as the screen cuts to black.

==Production==
Gabriadze was attracted to the project (then titled ''Offline'') as it focused on the theme of [[bullying]]. He noted that the nature of bullying had changed since he was in school, as the Internet allowed for bullies to continue their actions even after school hours.<ref name=YM>{{cite web|last=Loeffler|first=Shawn|title=FANTASIA 2014: GENRE REDEFINED – AN INTERVIEW WITH CYBERNATURAL’S DIRECTOR, LEO GABRIADZE|url=http://www.yellmagazine.com/fantasia-2014-genre-redefined-interview-cybernaturals-director-leo-gabriadze/88717/2/|publisher=Yell Magazine|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref>

Production was 16 days total, including six 12-hour days of principal photography, three days of pick-ups and then a few more reshoots.<ref name=slash>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/unfriended-movie-single-take/|title=The Unfriended Movie Was Filmed In A Single Take|website=slashfilm}}</ref> When filming began, it mostly consisted of long takes around ten minutes in length. Shelley Hennig, who portrayed Blaire, found that this proved difficult for the energy and motivation needed from her and the other actors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cook |first=Tommy |date=5 April 2015 |title=UNFRIENDED: Cast & Writer Reveal How the Movie Was Shot in a Single Long Take |url=http://collider.com/unfriended-panel-recap-wondercon/ |publisher=Collider |access-date=23 April 2016 }}</ref> At her request, at least one full, 80-minute-long take was filmed, with each actor in separate rooms with separate computers.<ref name=slash /> The film's ending was captured during one of these feature-length takes.<ref name=slash />

The film's title changed during shooting (and would also change prior to its theatrical release), as the film's crew felt that the title of ''Offline'' was "too general and not obvious" and that the then title of ''Cybernatural'' was "more to the point of what it is".<ref name=YM /> For wide release, the film was re-titled ''Unfriended''.

==Release==
''Unfriended'' initially had its world premiere on July 20, 2014 at the [[Fantasia Festival]] and screened on the film festival circuit under the title of ''Cybernatural''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chipman|first=Bob|title=Trailer: Unfriended is The First Social-Media Horror Movie|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/139455-Trailer-For-Social-Media-Horror-Movie-Unfriended|publisher=Escapist Magazine|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref> A generally positive film festival reception and test screenings for the film prompted [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] to pick up the film rights with the intent to give it a wide theatrical release the following year.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Ryan|title=Levan Gabriadze's Cybernatural picked up by Universal|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/levan-gabriadzes-cybernatural-picked-up-by-universal-287|publisher=JoBlo|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Seddon|first=Gem|title=First Trailer For Unfriended Plays Like A Skype Generation Slasher|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/trailer-unfriended-plays-skype-generation-slasher/|publisher=We Got This Covered|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}</ref> The film's title was changed from ''Cybernatural'' to ''Unfriended'' and the film was theatrically released on April 17, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=Orange|first=B.

''[[Dread Central]]'' also praised the film overall, but stated that they felt that the movie's one major flaw was "the fashion in which we are trafficked to each scare- through multi-screen clicking, copying, pasting and re-sizing, basically all-around multi-tasking. It can be trying to sit through and I liken it to sitting over someone's shoulder watching them web-surf... endlessly."<ref>{{cite web|last=Boiselle|first=Matt|title=Cybernatural (review)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/cybernatural-2014#axzz39mTMY7Ny|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> It was named Most Innovative Film at the [[Fantasia Film Festival]] and received a Special Mention for Feature Film.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Andrew|title=Fantasia 2014: Award Winners Announced|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/08/fantasia-2014-award-winners-announced.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref>

British film critic [[Mark Kermode]] gave the film a positive review, calling it a film which understands Skyping culture and cyber-bullying. He said, "Many people who've seen the trailer say, 'You're being stalked through the internet. Just log off.' The point is they can't because they're addicted." While on one hand admitting it was a "shrieky, teen-terrorized, slasher movie," on the other hand he said it was a film about how cyber-bullying only works if you cooperate with it.<ref>{{YouTube|3H133cQfz-w|Mark Kermode reviews Unfriended}}</ref>

Irish film critic Donald Clarke, writing for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', gave the film a very positive review, describing it as "genuinely unsettling" and praising the filmmakers' "uncanny grasp of the complicated dynamics of contemporary interaction" and how they succeeded in "[retaining] a position on the moral high ground while bloody mayhem rages around their feet".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Donald|title=Unfriended review: imaginative and genuinely unsettling horror classic|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/unfriended-review-imaginative-and-genuinely-unsettling-horror-classic-1.2195450|website=Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref>

Some critics found the film to contain unintentionally amusing moments that detracted from the experience. Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' and Lauren Chval of ''[[RedEye]]'' found that the film's scenes involving Blaire's pleas for help on Chatroulette, as well as some of the phrases typed by Laura's ghost (including "but in this version [of a drinking game], the loser doesn’t drink. The loser dies.") to be more humorous than frightening.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lumenick |first=Lou |date=16 April 2015 |title=Bullied teen gets post-mortem revenge in amusing horror flick ‘Unfriended’ |url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/16/bullied-teen-gets-post-mortem-revenge-in-amusing-horror-flick-unfriended/ |publisher=New York Post |access-date=23 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Chval |first=Lauren |date=16 April 2016 |title='Unfriended' is so funny you'll forget to be scared |publisher=RedEye |access-date=23 June 2016}}</ref>
