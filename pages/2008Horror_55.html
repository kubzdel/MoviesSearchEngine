==Plot==
Secret [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] interrogations of suspected terrorists are being conducted on an American [[World War II]]-era ship in the [[Persian Gulf]]. After mysterious sounds are heard on the ship, an unexplained force kills the crew. When contact with the ship is lost, the U.S. military sends a team of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and two scientists to investigate. When they land on the ship, they discover that almost all the crew have been killed. The team, led by Col. John Willets ([[Lance Henriksen]]), cannot make contact with command, while the ship drifts toward [[Iran|Iranian]] waters.  Willets interrogates one of the scientists and learns that the mysterious force is the ghost of a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] officer who was created to be a secret weapon. The ghost, which has strong [[psychic]] powers, is trapped on the ship and the two scientists were sent to try to capture it.  Meanwhile, the supposed terrorist being interrogated onboard turns out to be an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]-educated decoy (who was forced to impersonate a terrorist).  He aids in the efforts to destroy the ghost, before being killed by it.

==Production==
An example of low-budget [[guerrilla filmmaking]], the film cost a reported $350,000 and was shot in 15 days using a couple of Panasonic HVX-200 HD digital cameras.<ref>[http://www.wiseacrefilms.com/wiseacre_site/black_ops.html black ops - Wiseacre Films]</ref> The producers secured a restored museum [[Liberty ship]] docked in [[Los Angeles]] and shot mostly at night after museum patrons had left.  Luckily the ship made a trip to a World War II San Diego event, affording the producers to get "at sea" footage for free.<ref>[http://www.hometheaterinfo.com/black_ops_%28deadwater%29.htm Black Ops (Deadwater) - Hometheatre Info]</ref> All the guns were plastic models, so all the muzzle flashes and sound effects were laid in later. Director Roel Reine does a commentary with all this information.<ref>[http://www.dcdouglas.com/acting-v-deadwater.htm Black Ops aka Deadwater]</ref>

==Release==
The film premiered on 20 July 2008 as direct to video production over [[First Look Studios]].<ref>[http://www.rebelfilm.com/film/Rebel_film/Released.html Rebel Film - Released]</ref>
