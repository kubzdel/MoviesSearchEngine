==Reception==
''[[Shock Till You Drop]]'' panned the film overall, criticizing the film's script and direction, as they felt that O'Brien "goes overboard with the tricks and gimmicks."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Doro|first1=Paul|title=Review: Set Your GPS to Avoid Devil’s Mile|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/362313-review-devils-mile-horror-movie/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' was also highly critical of the film and commented that they saw the film as being "weird for weirdness sake, without any real thematic or pulpy endgame in mind" and wrote that "It’s like filmmaker Joseph O’Brien is pounding you over the head with his alleged self-importance without having anything to back it up. It’s a frustrating experience."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Patrick|title=[Review] Travel the ‘Devil’s Mile’|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3298891/review-devils-mile-frustrating-mess/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Twitch Film]]'' gave an overly favorable review for ''Devil's Mile'', praising the film's visual elements, script, and post effects, stating that "O'Brien displays the right amount of patience to get the right amount of tension out of his audience."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mack|first1=Andrew|title=Fantasia 2014 Review: Can You Escape From THE DEVIL'S MILE?|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/07/fantasia-2014-review-can-you-escape-from-the-devils-mile.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>
