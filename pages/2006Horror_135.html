==Plot==
Karl pays his girlfriend Julie a surprise visit while she is babysitting her neighbour's children.  He brings with him a [[Ouija board]] that Julie has been asking to play with.  However, unhappy about messing around with the [[occult]], Karl has deliberately left the board at home. Determined to have her way, Julie fashions a makeshift Ouija board out of an innocent child's [[alphabet toy]], and, when Karl is bitten by one of the [[hamsters]], she uses a drop of his blood to consecrate it. The couple then attempt to summon up a spirit, unaware that they have come up with the name of a demon, which arrives in a bolt of lightning, electrocuting the family hamsters and then possessing their dead bodies, turning them into demonic possessed [[zombie]] [[hamsters]]
