'''''Shrove Tuesday''''', also known as '''''Shrove Tuesday: The Legend Of Pancake Marion''''', is a short film, stylistically based on the fairytales created by the [[Brothers Grimm]]. It was produced in the United Kingdom in 2009, and directed by Lee Andrew Matthews.<ref>http://www.fleshfuryimageworks.co.uk/shrove%20tuesday.html</ref><ref>http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/gloucestershireheadlines/Budding-director-wows-Cleeve-horror-flick/article-1491378-detail/article.html</ref>

It tells the story of Pancake Marion, an 18th-century Witch, who was burned alive for her '[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]' ways. Her evil spirit returned whenever a protective flower (planted to keep her at bay) had wilted, or was picked by local children.

A young girl finds the flower, and thus begins a 22-minute hell ride into your darkest fears.
