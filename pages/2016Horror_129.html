==Plot==
Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in [[Mexico]], the same beach her mother visited while she was pregnant with Nancy. Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach. Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats with her sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that her mother's death caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school.

While surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a large [[humpback whale]] nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large [[great white shark]] knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard strap to slow the bleeding from her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together. Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded [[Gull|seagull]], which was also injured by the shark, and names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, a drunk local man on the beach steals Nancy's belongings. While wading out into the shallow water to steal Nancy's surfboard, however, he is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.

One of the local surfers was wearing a [[GoPro]] camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet had come off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees the helmet floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.

With high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby [[buoy]], narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of [[jellyfish]], which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a [[flare gun]] on the buoy. She shoots one flare to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but the ship has already turned away and does not see her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise having no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy and rips out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, Nancy pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on some [[rebar]] from the buoy's anchor.

Later, a boy named Miguel at the beach finds the action camera and informs his father, Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore. One year later, a healed Nancy (now a doctor) and her sister Chloe go surfing in [[Galveston, Texas]], as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been proud.

For the seagull character of Steven Seagull, the usage of both CGI and a [[puppet]] was considered based on the belief that it would be inordinately hard to train such a bird to act. This "horrified" both producers, Matti Leshem and Lynn Harris, who wanted to work with an actual animal. While scouting for location in Australia, Lively was able to feed a group of seagulls, at which point it was realized that it would be possible to use them for production.<ref name="Cosmo">{{cite web|last1=Greco|first1=Patti|title=13 Crazy Behind-the-Scenes Facts About Blake Lively's Shark Movie, The Shallows|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a60425/shallows-facts-blake-lively/|website=Cosmopolitan|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> The initial script featured Lively talking to the bird much more, and likewise, scenes featuring such an interaction were shot.

Much of the film was shot in a tank using bluescreens for effects. Still, Collet-Serra wanted to avoid the "more stylized look" of similar films using the set up and estimated that 10% of the film was shot on location in order to "trick" the audience into believing the setting was real: he explains: "Every scene has one shot that is real, and the other 99% is not – but the one real shot tricks you".<ref name="wegotthiscoveredtrick">{{cite web|last1=Donato|first1=Matt|title=Exclusive Interview: Jaume Collet-Serra Talks The Shallows|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/exclusive-interview-jaume-collet-serra-talks-shallows/|website=Wegotthiscovered|accessdate=August 16, 2016}}</ref> The shark was made entirely through [[computer generated imagery]], which was only completed close to the start of the marketing campaign for the film.<ref name="fearyear">{{cite web|last1=Giroux|first1=Jack|title=Interview: ‘The Shallows’ Director Jaume Collet-Serra on “The Fear That Lasts a Year”|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-shallows-jaume-collet-serra/|website=Slashfilm|accessdate=August 16, 2016|page=1}}</ref> [[/Film]] noted that the use of CGI was unusual for Collet-Serra, as he typically used practical effects as opposed to the digital ones required by the shoot.<ref name="fearyear"/> Lively ended up performing several of her own stunts, including a scene where her character breaks her nose.

''The Shallows'' was originally supposed to be released on June 29, 2016, but to avoid ''[[The Purge: Election Year]]'' and their second weekend being on the holiday of July 4, the film was instead released on Friday, June 24, 2016, by [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Sony Dates 16 Films Including Two More 'Bad Boys' Sequels, 'Jumanji' Remake|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sony-films-bad-boys-jennifer-lawrence-passengers-1201557242/|accessdate=October 25, 2015|work=variety.com|date=August 5, 2015}}</ref>

Staci Layne Wilson of [[Dread Central]] gave the film a negative review, saying although she wanted to like it, she felt that with "Jaume Collet-Serra's sledgehammer-style direction, Anthony Jaswinski's intelligence-insulting screenplay, and Marco Beltrami's misguided musical score, ''The Shallows'' is impossible to endorse."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/173180/shallows-the-2016/|title=Shallows, The (2016) - Dread Central|date=June 23, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=June 23, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The A.V.

He also took issue with the writing, stating: "Anthony Jaswinski’s screenplay bogs down this no-brainer survival premise (“get off the rock and don’t die”) with needless backstory and inchoate themes. Can’t a heroine just survive a vicious shark attack without also having to overcome a family trauma and make a decision about whether or not she wants to be a doctor?"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vishnevetsky|first1=Ignatiy|title=The gimmicky survival thriller The Shallows is out of its depth|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/gimmicky-survival-thriller-shallows-out-its-depth-238656|website=The A.V.
