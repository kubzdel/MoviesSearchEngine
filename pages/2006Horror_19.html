'''''Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon''''' is a 2006 American [[mockumentary]] [[black comedy]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Scott Glosserman]]. It stars [[Nathan Baesel]], [[Angela Goethals]], [[Robert Englund]] and Scott Wilson. Although largely filmed in [[Oregon]], the film takes place in a small town in [[Maryland]], and follows a journalist and her film crew that is documenting an aspiring [[serial killer]] who models himself according to slasher film conventions.

The film is an homage to the [[slasher film]] genre and features cameos from several veteran horror actors, including [[Robert Englund]], [[Zelda Rubinstein]], and [[Kane Hodder]]. The film premiered at the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] film festival and was shown at several other festivals. It received a [[limited release]] in the United States on March 16, 2007.

==Plot==
The film is shot as a documentary set in a world where the killers depicted in famous [[slasher film]]s are real. A female journalist named Taylor Gentry and her two cameramen, Doug and Todd, document the preparations of Leslie Vernon as he prepares to join the ranks of other slasher villains. Leslie takes his identity from an urban legend about a boy who killed his family and was cast into a river by angry townsfolk.

He initially claims to be the vengeful spirit of the slain boy but soon admits that he is an ordinary man named Leslie Mancuso who must rely on conventional tactics rather than supernatural powers. Taylor and her crew film Leslie's meticulous preparations to slaughter a number of teenagers in an abandoned house and then be confronted by a virginal "[[Final girl|survivor girl]]", Kelly. Taylor and her crew come to share Leslie's enthusiasm for his project, but their consciences catch up with them on the night of the murders.

They beg Leslie to call off his killing spree, but Leslie is adamant, believing that his survivor girl will define herself by facing him. Taylor and her crew abandon their documentary and at this point the film shifts from a documentary style to a traditional [[horror film]] presentation. Taylor attempts to warn and rally the remaining teens together to fight Leslie, but Leslie's preparations repeatedly give him the upper hand. The group looks to Kelly - who is revealed to be ''very'' sexually active - for leadership, but she unexpectedly dies when trying to escape.

Taylor quickly realizes that, as a virgin herself, she was Leslie's true survivor girl all along. Leslie continues picking off the group one-by-one until only Taylor remains. She faces Leslie and defeats him in the exact manner he had laid out for her, then burns down the shed in which he was defeated. She then runs into Doug and Doc Halloran who survived their encounters with Leslie. However, Leslie's preparations included learning to feign death and slathering himself with flame-retardant gel.

Over the final credits, security camera footage reveals Leslie's charred body sitting up on an autopsy table, still alive, accompanied by the song "[[Psycho Killer]]" by [[Talking Heads]].

Filming took place in November 2004.

Due to the limited budget and location restrictions, some of the script was re-written during filming to accommodate the filming locations.<ref name="making" /> During filming, several locations needed for certain scenes had yet to be scouted and were discovered in the middle of shooting.

Actor [[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]] became involved in the film after a suggestion from friend [[Robert Englund]], who was already cast in the film.<ref name="making" />

Director Scott Glosserman recruited a group of young local filmmakers in Portland to work as additional [[film editing|editors]] on the film after seeing and being impressed by an independent film they had produced called ''The Black Shoe Drifter''.<ref name="making" />

==Critical reception==
''Behind the Mask'' was generally well received by film critics. Review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 76% rating based on 37 reviews. The consensus states: "A smart mockumentary that presents a gory, funny, and obviously affectionate skewering of the slasher genre."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/behind_the_mask_the_rise_of_leslie_vernon |title=Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=May 1, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 66/100 rating based on 14 critics, indicating "generally positive reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/behind-the-mask-the-rise-of-leslie-vernon | title=Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=May 1, 2015}}</ref>

Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''New York Daily News'' called the film "a must for those who like thrills laced with a sense of humor" and noted the film's deadpan sense of humor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/short-takes-article-1.217684|work=NY Daily News|date=16 March 2007|last=Weitzman|first=Elizabeth|accessdate=18 July 2012|title=Short Takes - Film Reviews}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] said that it "provides a fresh, chilling breeze through the stale air of the crypt that has become multiplex horror", and awarded it three out of four stars,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2259|work=ReelViews|last=Berardinelli|first=James|date=7 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012|title=Behind the Mask}}</ref> while the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' referred to it as "original and weirdly delicious, and executed with gory aplomb."<ref>{{cite news|last=Ordoña|first=Michael|title=Behind the Mask review|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 2007}}</ref>

[[Stephen Hunter]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said the film's "breakdown of cliches is vivid and witty", noting that its intended audience was "genre deconstructionists" and "smart young people who have studied horror/slasher movies and enjoy them for their vulgar energy."<ref name="wp">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id=1134138&categories=Movies&nm=1|work=Washington Post|last=Hunter|first=Stephen|date=15 March 2007|accessdate=18 July 2012|title=Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon - Editorial review}}</ref> Hunter also called the performances of Baesal and Goethals "brilliant".<ref name="wp" />

Contrarily, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' gave the film an unfavorable review, stating: "Desperately overcompensating for the fact that most horror films are already parodies of themselves, ''Behind the Mask'' takes a bite out of the dumb ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' franchise before devouring its own tail, proving that you are what you eat."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-03-06/film/behind-the-mask-the-rise-of-leslie-vernon/|work=The Village Voice|date=6 March 2007|last=Gonzalez|first=Ed|title='Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon|accessdate=18 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028185950/http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-03-06/film/behind-the-mask-the-rise-of-leslie-vernon/|archivedate=October 28, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Sequel==
In an interview David J. Stieve, when asked if he was working on new scripts, said,

{{quote|"Well, then you’re treading into sequel territory. If there is any kind of scoop, it’s not really a scoop but... I can tell you and your readers that there is a definite idea for what’s going to happen to Leslie Vernon next, that’s been the goal all along. There are a lot of what-ifs, and things to have to happen right in this business for that to ever come to fruition, but certainly if there’s going to be another horror movie coming from me, my biggest impulse, of course, is to relate what happens to Leslie next."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconsoffright.com/IV_DavidJStieve.htm|title=David J Stieve Interview|work=Icons of Fright|accessdate=November 28, 2013}}</ref>}}

Baesel, when asked about the possibility of returning for a sequel to ''Behind the Mask'', stated, "[...] there’s a certain chance. I know that ideas have already been circulating around Scott and David’s heads and I’d love to take Leslie on again. However, I don’t think we’d undertake a sequel unless the script is as good or better than ''Behind the Mask''. The first was so good it would be pissing on Leslie’s legacy to set out with anything less than inspired ... and Leslie would never have that."<ref>Gurnow, Michael. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130815124419/http://www.horrorreview.com/essay/egnathanbaesel2007.html Behind Leslie Vernon: An Interview with Nathan Baesel]."</ref>

In early 2017, director Scott Glosserman explained that the script for the sequel had become a little dated due to the changes in horror over the intervening years.

{{quote|The script itself captures that mid-aughts period, in the midst of the torture porn/found footage genres. It had a lot of interesting things to say. Today, that script, that film, is almost like a period piece because I don’t necessarily want to bring it up to current day, and yet, certain things may feel a little bit old or period, depending on how you look at it. I think we captured the essence of what was happening several years ago. If we do get the opportunity to make the film, I’m not sure I’d want to make the screenplay any more current. It’s a little bit of a conundrum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3425949/director-updates-behind-mask-sequel-10th-anniversary-blu-ray-coming/ |title=Director Updates on ‘Behind the Mask’ Sequel; 10th Anniversary Blu-ray Coming |last=Squires |first=John |date=2017-02-24 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>}}
