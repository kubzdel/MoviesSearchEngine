'''''The Pyramid''''' is a 2014 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Grégory Levasseur]], produced by [[Alexandre Aja]], and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is presented as [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] documenting the exploration of a recently discovered pyramid by a team of archaeologists. Written by Daniel Meersand and Nick Simon, the film stars [[Ashley Hinshaw]], [[Denis O'Hare]], [[James Buckley (actor)|James Buckley]] and Daniel Amerman. ''The Pyramid'' was released on December 5, 2014, and was negatively received by critics.

==Plot==
During the 2012–13 uprisings in Egypt, an archaeological team discovers a vast pyramid buried {{convert|600|feet|m}} below the surface. Further examinations of the pyramid's apex reveals that the structure is three-sided, unlike any pyramid previously discovered. They locate a tunnel leading into the apex of the pyramid. While breaking into the opening, a large amount of toxic air is released, poisoning a worker. Soon after, Egyptian authorities order the team to leave the site because of a violent uprising in nearby Cairo. Team leader Dr. Miles Holden (O'Hare) and his daughter Nora argue over whether to obey the order. They eventually agree to send in a NASA-supplied remote-controlled [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] vehicle – nicknamed Shorty – to enter the pyramid and document its interior. 

While examining a small portion of the structure, Shorty is attacked by an unknown creature and goes offline. After a heated argument between Dr. Holden and Zahir (Amir K), the portion of the team that has remained at the site decide to enter the pyramid to recover Shorty. After finding only a piece of the rover, they discover the wire tracing their way back out was cut. Realizing they may be lost, they enter a room with an unstable floor that collapses beneath them. The team scramble to their feet and look around them. As they begin to become heated with one another, a sudden fall of debris injures team member Zahir, as it crushes his leg beneath a large stone chunk that is unmovable. Sunni (Nicola), another team member reporting on the find, attempts to climb up a long narrow opening but is attacked by a terrifying creature hidden at the top and falls back down. Nora notices scratches as if from claws across Sunni's cheek. Forced to leave Zahir behind, they look for another way out. Within moments, they hear Zahir's screams and return to find only a bloody trail leading up the wall, where he'd apparently been dragged off; his severed leg left pinned under the rock. His girlfriend Nora is left bewildered and distraught, and the team begins to lose hope of escape.

They are pursued through a narrow tunnel they attempt to escape through by a pack of the same creatures Sunni encountered before, which have an emaciated feral cat-like appearance. An Egyptian soldier, Shadid, who had found another way into the pyramid rescues them in time, pulling them out of the tunnel. After shooting a few of the creatures, he peers into the tunnel and is suddenly seized by a larger creature and pulled inside, snapping his back in the process (due to the small opening of the shaft he was pulled back through). Left to fend for themselves, the team soon comes upon a carved mural that depicts passages from the [[Book of the Dead]] and its guide to immortality - Anubis's weighing of the heart for access into the afterlife. A few jump-scares later, Dr. Holden accidentally triggers a sand trap and most of the team manage to escape. However, Sunni (during the chaos) is bumped from behind by the cameraman Fitzie (Buckley) and falls into a spike pit, impaling herself through her chest lower abdomen and leg. She is immediately pounced upon and torn to pieces by some of the feral cats. Dr. Holden throws a lit flare into the pit which scares away the cats, and the team lower themselves down. While racing against the dwindling light of the flare, the crew attempt to help Sunni. Unfortunately, they are not quick enough, and as they try to pull Sunni off the spikes, she suffers from a seizure and damages her internal organs. Sunni succumbs to her injuries and the team is forced to retreat by the return of the cats.

Forced to keep moving, the team finds a burial chamber which contains the corpse of an explorer (with a ring engraved with a [[Freemason]] symbol) who had been trapped in the pyramid roughly during the late 19th century. A journal he left behind details a possible escape route from the burial chamber. Dr. Holden begins to explain the map when suddenly a clawed hand stabs through his chest, tearing out his heart. Nora and Fitzie flee, but after realizing they're trapped, they return to find Dr. Holden still alive tied to a large scale, just like previously depicted on the mural. They quickly hide, just as the large creature reenters the room. Nora recognizes the creature as the Egyptian god [[Anubis]], half jackal and half man, who is seen weighing Dr. Holden's heart in an ancient ritual to determine his worthiness to enter the afterlife. Miles Holden is deemed unworthy and dies when Anubis eats his heart.

After Anubis leaves, Nora and Fitzie decipher hieroglyphs in the chamber that indicate the pyramid was constructed to imprison Anubis, who is seeking to reunite with his creator, [[Osiris]]. They find an air shaft with a ladder left behind by the soldier Shadid, but as they attempt to escape, Anubis sees and pursues them. Nora climbs up first and Fitzie follows, but midway up the ladder he is grabbed from below and dragged to his death. Now alone, Nora continues to scramble up the crumbling ladder and reaches the top, but just as she does so, is captured by Anubis and dragged back down. Tied to an obelisk, she uses a blade hidden in her hand to slowly cut through her bonds before Anubis can finish his ritual. Once free, she wounds Anubis, who is then attacked by a horde of the scavenger cats allowing Nora to escape. Exhausted and traumatized, she finally climbs her way to freedom and collapses just before clearing the pyramid's exit (looking like the proverbial 'light at the end of the tunnel'). She awakens sunburned and injured, only to discover an Egyptian child playing with her camera. He looks questioningly at her, and she pleads for him to help her. Unable to understand her (as he does not speak English) the boy has no time to react before Anubis suddenly appears from the dark behind the boy. Lunging at them both, Anubis presumably kills them.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
''The Pyramid'' was heavily panned by critics, with [[Moviefone]] and [[CraveOnline]] both naming it one of the worst films of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/articles/801875-worst-films-2014-second-opinion#/slide/3|title=The Worst Films of 2014 |work=CraveOnline|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2014/12/18/worst-movies-of-2014/#slide=3211956|title=The 10 Worst Movies of 2014 |work=The Moviefone Blog|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 13%, based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 2.8/10. The site's consensus reads "Poorly lit and thinly writ, ''The Pyramid'' houses little more than clunky dialogue, amateurish acting, and dusty found-footage scares."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_pyramid_2014/|title=The Pyramid|date=December 5, 2014|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 10, 2015}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 24 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pyramid|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-pyramid|website=Metacritic|accessdate=12 May 2015}}</ref>

Lelsie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "a stinker in every sense."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/pyramid-film-review-754197|title=‘The Pyramid’: Film Review|author=Leslie Felperin|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref> Drew Taylor of The Playlist wrote, "''The Pyramid'' is cursed.
