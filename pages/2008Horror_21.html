Both the film's title and its plot timeline being set on 12 July, stem from [[King William III]]'s 12 July 1690 [[Battle of the Boyne]].  Created on a budget of ₤10,000, the filmmaker chose [[The Troubles]] as the film's inspiration and as a means to address the issue of division with a twist that shows the two sides of the Belfast community joining together to deal with a common threat.<ref name="Belfast Telegraph 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/the-zombie-movie-set-at-an-ulster-flashpoint-13488801.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130419195132/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/the-zombie-movie-set-at-an-ulster-flashpoint-13488801.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 April 2013 |title=The zombie movie set at an Ulster flashpoint |publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=12 September 2011 |author=Lesley-Anne Henry }}</ref><ref name="Culture Northern Ireland">{{cite web | url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/2406/my-cultural-life-george-clark | title=My Cultural Life: George Clark | publisher=Culture Northern Ireland | date=12 September 2008 | accessdate=12 September 2011}}</ref><ref name="UTV">{{cite news |url=http://www3.u.tv/news/genEntertainment/index.asp?sel=3&sel2=1&local=1&id=13780&pt=e |title=UTV – Battle of the Bone premiere |date=18 July 2008 |publisher=UTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028105805/http://www3.u.tv/news/genEntertainment/index.asp?sel=3&sel2=1&local=1&id=13780&pt=e |archivedate=28 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref>  The film was first screened in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland on 17 July 2008.<ref name="Belfast Telegraph 2">{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/belfast-zombies-unleashed-in-cinema-13912044.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420022439/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/belfast-zombies-unleashed-in-cinema-13912044.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 2013 |title=Belfast Zombies Unleashed in Cinema |date=18 July 2008 |accessdate=23 July 2008 |publisher=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}</ref>

Canadian critical review site – www.critical-film.com described it as a "relentlessly kinetic and joyous picture; always running and usually running away, each character perpetually fighting for his/her life"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.critical-film.com/reviews/B/Battle_of_the_Bone/Battle_of_the_Bone.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20081221185543/http://www.critical-film.com/reviews/B/Battle_of_the_Bone/Battle_of_the_Bone.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 December 2008|title=Battle of the Bone review |accessdate=10 January 2009}}</ref>  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said, "It's too low budget to come across to most general audiences as much more than friends having fun around some local buildings and streets, but George Clarke's impassioned zombie pic gained immediate attention both for some vivaciously choreographed action sequences and for its political overtones."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000–2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=29–30|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>

The director stated in January 2010, "''Battle of the Bone'' may have wowed genre geeks, but some mainstream critics didn’t appreciate the film’s queasy concoction of zombies and Orangemen."<ref name="Belfast Telegraph 3">{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/hope-and-gory-14658429.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420062641/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/hope-and-gory-14658429.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 2013 |title=Hope and gory |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2011 |author=staff }}</ref>
