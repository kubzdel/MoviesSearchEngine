==Plot==
Jae-hyuk ([[Kim Myung-min]]) is a former professor with a doctorate in [[biochemistry]] who is currently working as a pharmaceutical sales representative after losing his life savings and his job due to a bad investment he made in the stock market on the advice of his younger brother. When a series of dead bodies are found floating in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]], the public is shocked to discover that the deaths are related to a fatal outbreak of virus-infected [[mutant]] [[parasitic]] [[horsehair worm]]s, called ''Yeongasi'', that can control the human brain. Those infected show symptoms of increased hunger without appropriate weight gain and excessive thirst when the worms are mature and ready to reproduce. Hence, they jump into the river to allow the worms to come out of the body. While the authorities work to find a cure, Jae-hyuk and his brother Jae-pil ([[Kim Dong-wan]]), a detective who is agonized with guilt for squandering Jae-hyuk's money in the stock market, struggle to save Jae-hyuk's family when they exhibit similar symptoms to the infected.<ref>{{cite news|title=Box Office: Deranged (Yeongasi) (Korea)|url=http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120621001231|accessdate=2012-06-27|newspaper=[[The Korea Herald]]|date=22 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Deranged (2012)|url=http://www.cjent.co.kr/eng/lineup/info.asp?MovieNo=319&MovieYear=2012&MovieTitle=|work=CJ E&M|accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref>
