== Synopsis ==
Aditya is seemingly living every Indian man's dream. He's married to a traditional wife, Ashwini, and has a young boy. But he is having an [[Extramarital sex|affair]] with his secretary, Geeta Menon who has a wild personality. He manages to balance the women with clever lies. He promises Geeta he will marry her, after divorcing Ashwini. He seems to display fetish behaviours with the two women.

On one of their romantic excursions, Aditya takes Geeta to his friend's bungalow at [[Madh Island]]. All seems fine until Geeta shocks Aditya with news that she is pregnant. Worried, he insists that they cannot have a child together and suggests an [[abortion]]. This attitude enrages Geeta and they engage in a fight in which he pushes her. She accidentally hits her head against a hard object, the force of which kills her instantly. He disposes of her body and returns home, behaving as if everything is normal.

His former lover returns as a [[vengeful ghost]] who will stop at nothing till she gets her [[revenge]]. She appears often to frighten Aditya. Ashwini notices her husband's fear of a ghost whom she cannot see. To relieve his guilt, Aditya admits his affair with Geeta and her death to Ashwini. His wife's reaction is to leave but she is then admitted to hospital due to a major accident. Geeta returns to the frame and gives her forgiveness to Aditya. Ashwini recovers but Geeta's revengeful soul has transferred into her body.
