The third [[List of films based on video games|video game]] [[film adaptation]] by Boll, who previously made the films based on ''[[House of the Dead (film)|House of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Alone in the Dark (2005 film)|Alone in the Dark]]'', ''BloodRayne'' received extremely negative reviews upon release and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $3.7 million from a $25 million budget.<ref name="mojo" />

==Plot==
{{Anchor|Synopsis}}
The film centers on the character of [[Rayne (BloodRayne)|Rayne]], an unholy breed of human and [[vampire]] called a [[Dhampir]]. Dhampir are unaffected by crucifixes and do not thirst for human blood. She is the daughter of the Vampire King Kagan who has gathered an army of thralls, both vampire and human, in order to annihilate the human race. She was conceived when Kagan [[rape]]d her mother, and she later witnessed him killing her.

Sebastian, Vladimir, and Katarin are three members of the Brimstone Society, who fight vampires. They hear of a carnival freak who may be a Dhampir, so Vladimir plans to recruit her in order to kill Kagan. Kagan is also hunting for her, fearing she will interfere with his plans. Rayne escapes captivity at the carnival. On the road, she encounters and saves a family being attacked by vampires. A fortune teller reveals to Rayne that Kagan has become the most powerful vampire in the land and resides in a well-protected castle. She tells Rayne that Kagan seeks an ancient talisman, a mystical eye, and if she finds it, it would allow her to gain an audience with Kagan. Rayne sets out to the monastery to find it.

Rayne shelters for the night at the monastery and later sneaks away to where the talisman is guarded by a hammer-wielding, deformed monk. The talisman is further protected by booby traps, and when Rayne lifts it from its pedestal, the chamber floods with holy water. As Rayne hangs from the ceiling to avoid the water, the talisman falls from the box but she catches the eyeball. Examining it closely, the eye magically becomes absorbed into her own eye, and when she falls into the water she is somehow unaffected by it.

When she leaves the chamber, the monks explain the artifact is one of three body parts which came from an ancient vampire called [[Belial]], who had found a way to overcome the weaknesses of a vampire. The eye overcomes holy water; the rib overcomes the cross; and the heart overcomes sunlight. The parts have been hidden across the lands. As Kagan wants all these parts, it becomes the heroes' mission to stop him.

Rayne is brought to the headquarters of the Brimstone society and they agree to work together to kill Kagan. Katarin does not trust Rayne and betrays Brimstone to her father, Elrich, who has fallen in league with Kagan, but seeks to betray him and gain power for himself. The location of the heart talisman is known to Katarin as her grandfather hid it in water-filled caves. She seeks it out but Rayne fights and kills her for it.  With the talisman, Rayne attempts to gain an audience before Kagan, but he takes the heart and throws her in the dungeon. He plans to extract the eye as part of a ritual. He realizes too late Rayne had only given him an empty box and not the heart.

Sebastian and Vladimir intervene, battling Kagan and his minions, but both are fatally wounded, leaving Rayne in a final battle against Kagan. As Sebastian dies he fires a final bolt from his crossbow, but Kagan is too quick and is able to catch it. Rayne is able to summon her last reserves of strength and plunge the bolt into his heart. The battle ends. Rayne seats herself in Kagan's throne. The film ends when Rayne leaves the castle and goes to the mountains.

==Critical reception==
{{Anchor|Critics}}
''BloodRayne'' was critically panned. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has a rating of only 4%, meaning that out of 51 reviews only 2 were positive. The consensus reads: "BloodRayne is an absurd sword-and-sorcery vid-game adaptation from schlock-maestro Uwe Boll, featuring a distinguished (and slumming) cast."<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|bloodrayne}} {{Retrieved|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref> It was ranked 48th in Rotten Tomatoes's 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Worst of the worst 2000-2009 Counting down the worst reviewed movies of the last ten years |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/worst_of_the_worst/6/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926125932/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/worst_of_the_worst/6/ |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a score of 18% based on 13 reviews, summarizing the reviews as "overwhelming dislike".<ref>{{metacritic film|id=bloodrayne|title=BloodRayne}} [[CBS]]</ref>

Actor Michael Madsen called ''BloodRayne'' "an abomination... a horrifying and preposterous movie", but added that he enjoyed working with Boll and would certainly work with him again if asked.<ref>{{cite news | date = August 30, 2008 | title = Madsen Still Scarred by BloodRayne Movie | url = http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/madsen%20still%20scarred%20by%20bloodrayne%20movie_1078904 | publisher = ContactMusic.com | quote = But, saying all that, Madsen would consider making another movie with the eccentric filmmaker: "Uwe was fun.

And that movie was so bad. I saw it on The Movie Channel and I couldn't even get through 20 minutes of it! It was so bad and it was kinda sad that they took that because I really liked the games."<ref>{{youtube|SKevjLdhCEs|Anime Boston 2007 Laura Bailey Panel}}.

Critics ridiculed Boll for hiring actual prostitutes instead of actors for a scene featuring [[Meat Loaf]] in order to save on production costs.<ref name="7mreview">[http://www.7mpictures.com/inside/reviews/bloodrayne_review.htm "BloodRayne" Movie Review] by Kevin Carr - 7M Pictures. {{Retrieved|accessdate=2009-09-30}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/bloodrayne/default.asp UGO.com Film/TV Uwe Boll ''BloodRayne''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605132751/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/bloodrayne/default.asp |date=5 June 2006 }} Interview</ref> Writer [[Guinevere Turner]] stated in the 2009 documentary [http://www.talesfromthescript.com Tales from the Script] that when she turned in her first draft of the film's script two weeks late, rather than asking for redrafts Boll accepted it and then made many of his own changes; and he then asked the actors to "take a crack at it".<ref>http://www.TalesfromtheScript.com</ref>

Some critics were more forgiving of the film. Berge Garabedian of JoBlo's movie reviews described as the film as "actually pretty decent…for what it is" namely a video game adaptation, with a "hot lead actress" in the form of Kristanna Loken, and number of surprisingly fun and bloody action sequences. He acknowledges the dialog is poor and the story lame but says the film is "not as bad as you’d suspect" and an adequate bloody low-budget vampire film.<ref>{{cite web | author = Berge Garabedian | title = JoBlo's movie review of Bloodrayne | url = http://www.joblo.com/reviews.php?mode=joblo_movies&id=1393 }} {{Rating|5|10}}</ref> Steve Chupnick of the ''Latino Review'' gave the film a B rating, saying that although it was not a good film it was far from the worst he's seen and mentioned the Kristanna Loken nude scene as something in the films favor.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-04-01 | author = Steve Chupnick | title = Bloodrayne | url = http://www.latinoreview.com/movie-reviews/bloodrayne-56 | work = Latino Review | quote = The rest of the film goes on with Rayne kicking ass and taking names. Good battle scenes and sword fights, and a hot-ass chick – what else can you ask for? }}Rating B.</ref>

==Sequels==
{{Anchor|Sequel}}
In 2007, a sequel ''[[BloodRayne 2: Deliverance]]'' was made. [[Natassia Malthe]] replaced Loken in the lead role.<ref name="casting">{{cite news | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/744/744203p1.html | title = ''BloodRayne 2'' Casting | work = [[IGN]] | publisher = [[News Corporation]] | date = 2006-11-06 | accessdate = 2006-12-19}}</ref> Due to the poor box office of the first film, ''BloodRayne 2: Deliverance'' went [[direct-to-video]] instead. A third film, ''[[BloodRayne: The Third Reich]]'' was released in 2011. Malthe reprised her role as Rayne.<ref>{{cite news | date = 2009-11-04 | title = Uwe Boll: Bloodrayne 3: Warhammer Shooting in January | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34389/uwe-boll-bloodrayne-3-warhammer-shooting-january | accessdate = 2009-11-07}}</ref> Both sequels were directed by Uwe Boll.

==Home media==
{{Anchor|DVD|Video}}
Before the DVD of this film was released, Boll removed the Romar name and logo from the credits and packaging of this film. As a result, Romar ceased distributing the film. Next to the R-rated version which was shown in cinemas, a more violent unrated director's cut which includes an extended ending was released on DVD. The director's cut DVD box set included a full copy of the ''[[BloodRayne 2]]'' video game on the second DVD.<ref>{{cite web | title = dOc DVD Review: Bloodrayne: Unrated Director's Cut (2005) | url = http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=8662}}</ref>
