'''''Autumn''''' is a 2009 Canadian [[horror film]] directed by [[Steven Rumbelow]], written by [[David Moody]] and Rumbelow, and starring [[Dexter Fletcher]].  It was based on Moody's self-published novel ''Autumn''.  Fletcher plays a schoolteacher who must survive in a [[post-apocalyptic]] world inhabited by evolving zombies.

== Plot ==
After a viral outbreak kills 99% of the world's population, scattered survivors come together and attempt to deal with the fall of civilization.  They face a new threat when the dead begin to reanimate.  Initially catatonic, the corpses slowly regain their senses, become increasingly sensitive to outside stimuli, and show signs of aggression.  Eventually, the survivors must fortify themselves against attack and try to find a reason to survive.

== Production ==
Author [[David Moody]] had offers on two of his novels, ''Autumn'' and ''Hater'', at the same time.  Although ''Hater'' had [[Guillermo Del Toro]] attached, Moody reasoned that ''Autumn'', as a small [[independent film]], had a greater chance of being made.  Moody made both deals and participated in the making of ''Autumn''.<ref name=starburst>{{cite journal|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/1592-interview-with-david-moody|title=Interview: David Moody, Author of the 'Hater' Trilogy|last=Gilliam|first=J.

David Moody, the author of the source novel, said, "Ultimately, although it has some redeeming qualities, and the main cast did a great job, I think it was a disappointment to a lot of people. The filmmakers were really stretched by having to work within a microscopic budget, and there are places where that really shows."<ref name=starburst/>  The negative reception of ''Autumn'' led [[Dexter Fletcher]] to direct his own films, which were better received.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/dexter-fletcher-interview-mr-sunshine-talks-switching-to-directing-bugsy-malone-and-waiting-for-the-doctor-who-call-from-steven-moffat-8844645.html|title=Dexter Fletcher interview: Mr Sunshine talks switching to directing, Bugsy Malone and waiting for the 'Doctor Who call' from Steven Moffat|last=Barber|first=Nicholas|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-01}}</ref>
