'''''Scary Movie 2''''' is a 2001 American [[Horror film|horror]] [[comedy film]] and the second film in the [[Scary Movie (film series)|''Scary Movie'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Anna Faris]],  [[Regina Hall]], [[Shawn Wayans]], and [[Marlon Wayans]] (all reprising their roles from the first film, despite their characters having been killed off), as well as [[Tim Curry]], [[Tori Spelling]], [[Chris Elliott]], [[Christopher Masterson|Chris Masterson]], [[Kathleen Robertson]], [[David Cross]], and [[James Woods]].

Where the original film was mainly based on the [[slasher film]]s of the '90s, ''Scary Movie 2'' parodies an array of supernatural and haunted house films from various decades, including ''[[The Haunting (1999)|The Haunting]]'' (1999), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' (1973), ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (1979), ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (1982), ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]'' (1973), ''House on Haunted Hill'' (both the [[House on Haunted Hill|1959]] and [[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|1999 versions]]), and ''[[The Changeling (1980 film)|The Changeling]]'' (1980). It also spoofs some contemporary films, such as ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000).

The film is the last in the series to feature the involvement of stars [[Marlon Wayans|Marlon]] and [[Shawn Wayans]], and director [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]]. However, the Wayans would eventually go on to produce a similar horror-themed parody, ''[[A Haunted House]]'', and [[A Haunted House 2|its sequel]], both starring Marlon Wayans.

Despite generally negative reviews from critics, ''Scary Movie 2'' was a box office success, grossing $141.2 million worldwide from a $45 million budget.<ref name="mojo"/>

==Plot==
A teenage girl named Megan Voorhees ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) becomes possessed by the spirit of Hugh Kane ([[Richard Moll]]), the house's previous owner. During a formal dinner party she emerges in her pajamas, insults her mother and the guests, then proceeds to urinate profusely on the floor. In response, Megan's mother ([[Veronica Cartwright]]) seeks help from two priests, Father McFeely ([[James Woods]]) and Father Harris ([[Andy Richter]]). After paying a trip to the bathroom, the men attempt to drive Hugh's ghost out, but the exorcism does not go as planned. After a chain of projectile vomits and various instances of pedophilia, Megan insults Father McFeely's mother. He responds by pulling out a gun and shooting Megan.

Meanwhile, Cindy Campbell ([[Anna Faris]]), Brenda Meeks ([[Regina Hall]]), Ray Wilkins ([[Shawn Wayans]]), and Shorty Meeks ([[Marlon Wayans]]) are at college, trying to live new lives since [[Scary Movie|the events of the first film]]. Cindy and Brenda get tagged by a socially maladjusted girl, Alex ([[Tori Spelling]]). Shorty is still the same stoner he was before. Ray, still confused about his sexuality, has two new male friends, Tommy (James DeBello) and Buddy ([[Christopher Masterson]]). Buddy becomes romantically interested in Cindy, but she rebuffs him.

Professor Oldman  ([[Tim Curry]]) and his charming paraplegic assistant, Dwight Hartman ([[David Cross]]), plan to study the paranormal activity at a local [[Haunted house|haunted mansion]] called Hell House. They use Cindy and her friends as test subjects. At the mansion, Cindy encounters a foul-mouthed parrot and Hanson ([[Chris Elliott]]), the caretaker with a badly malformed hand. Later, the group is joined by newcomer Theo ([[Kathleen Robertson]]). They sit down for dinner, but soon lose their appetite due to Hanson's repulsive antics.

Later that night, Cindy hears voices directing her to a secret room, where she and Buddy discover the diary of Hugh Kane's wife. Seeing her portrait, they note Cindy's resemblance to her. Meanwhile, other teens also experience bizarre encounters. Hugh Kane's ghost has sex with Alex in her bedroom, but retreats when Alex expresses her interest in becoming the new Mrs. Kane. Cindy gets involved in a fistfight with the house cat, Mr. Kittles. A toy clown ([[Suli McCullough]]) attempts to kill Ray, but in a strange turn of events, the clown doll gets raped by Ray instead. A weed-monster rolls Shorty into a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. It tries to smoke him, but gets distracted by [[Junk food|munchies]] and lets him escape.

Professor Oldman is seduced and killed by the ghost of Hugh's mistress. Shorty later encounters the same ghost, but seduces and has sex with her. After Dwight equips the teens with weapons that can injure their spectral enemy, they are pursued throughout the mansion. Buddy and Cindy get locked in the walk-in freezer. Cindy gives Buddy a [[handjob]] and "revives" him, resulting in him releasing semen blasting Cindy to the door. Cindy then [[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|uses a collection of random objects]] in the room to produce a [[Caterpillar tractor]] and escapes the freezer.

Hanson gets possessed by Kane and kidnaps Shorty, who is high on drugs. In the dining room, Hanson sets up a cooker and cuts off the top of Shorty's head. Instead of a brain, there is a small man rapping ([[Beetlejuice (entertainer)|Beetlejuice]]) inside. Cindy, Brenda, and Theo team up to fight Hanson, but wind up defeated. Dwight regroups with the teens. Cindy acts as bait to lure Kane into a device that will destroy him. The plan succeeds, freeing the group from the house's curse.

Two months later, Cindy and Buddy are in a relationship. They are out on a walk when Buddy disappears and Hanson shows up. As he closes in menacingly, he gets hit by a car. The car's driver is Shorty, who is receiving a [[blowjob]] from the ghost that he seduced earlier.

==Background==
The film is a sequel to ''[[Scary Movie]]''. According to director [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], the makers of the film watched over 130 horror films for background research.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1425783.stm|title=Scary sequel 'out-grosses' first|author=Brook, Tom|date=6 July 2001|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> [[Marlon Brando]] was originally cast as Father McFeely and completed one day of filming before he had to leave the production due to illness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.com/celebrity/brandos-scary-scene/|title=Brando's 'Scary' Scene|author=Silverman, Stephen M.|date=15 June 2001|publisher=people.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref> He was replaced by [[James Woods]] who was paid $1 million for four days work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/news.britneyspears|title=Hugh Grant up for Harry Potter role|date=29 June 2001|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>
[[Charlton Heston]] has also turned down the James Woods part. Because Miramax had not greenlit this sequel until the massive box office success of the original, the film faced a punishing production schedule that involved coming up with a script and tearing through production and post-production in a total of less than 9 months, roughly half the average time for all those steps to be completed on a standard Hollywood production in 2000-2001.
