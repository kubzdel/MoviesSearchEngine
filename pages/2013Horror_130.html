==Plot==
Distraught after losing his fortune in the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], stockbroker Jeffrey Desange kills all of his business partners, his employees, and estranged wife before taking his children, three-year-old Victoria and one-year-old Lilly, away from home. Driving dangerously fast on a snowy road, Jeffrey loses control and the car slides down the mountain, ramming into the woods and breaking Victoria's glasses.  Surviving, he takes the children into an abandoned cabin. Planning to kill his daughters and commit suicide, he holds a gun to Victoria's head, but a shadowy figure turns the tables by killing him. The girls, huddled by the fireside, are tossed a cherry by the mysterious figure.

Five years later, a rescue party, sponsored by Jeffrey's [[identical twin]] brother Lucas, finds Victoria and Lilly alive and well, but in a [[Feral child|feral state]] after years of isolation. The girls are put in a welfare clinic under the psychiatric care of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss. They make reference to "Mama", a maternal protector figure. The girls are initially hostile to Lucas but Victoria recognizes him after he gives her a pair of glasses and she can see him properly. Dreyfuss agrees to support Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel's custody claim against the girls' maternal great-aunt, Jean Podolski, as long as Dreyfuss is allowed to monitor the progress of the girls. Victoria acclimates quickly to domestic life while Lilly retains much of her feralness (language regression, growling, lying on the floor), not being used to being around people.

While in bed with Lucas, Annabel is startled by the appearance of a monstrous figure. Lucas is attacked by "Mama" and is put into a coma. Annabel, who is uncomfortable being around the girls, finds herself left alone to care for them. Although Annabel makes progress with Victoria, she finds Lilly hostile. Alarmed by nightmares of a strange woman and Victoria's warning about Mama's jealousy, Annabel asks Dreyfuss to investigate. He initially thought "Mama" to be an imaginary [[Dissociative identity disorder|alter-ego]] of Victoria; however, his research corroborates Victoria's story that Mama is an aggrieved mother and brings to light the story of Edith Brennan, a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] patient in the 1800s.

Dreyfuss recovers a box from a government warehouse containing a baby's remains. Annabel has a nightmare revealing Mama's past: when Edith Brennan ("Mama") was sent to St. Gertrude's Asylum for an unknown reason, her child was taken from her and given to nuns. She escaped the asylum, stabbed a nun and took her baby back. Fleeing her pursuers, Edith jumped off a cliff but before hitting the water below, she and the child made impact with a large branch. Edith drowned but the child's body snagged on the branch and did not fall with her into the water. Annabel realizes that Mama still hasn't realized her child died from hitting the tree and didn't understand why her baby wasn't in the water with her; in her distress, Mama unsuccessfully searched the woods for her child for more than a century until she discovered Victoria and Lilly, taking them on as substitutes.

Lucas regains consciousness after a vision of his dead brother, Jeffrey, tells him to save his daughters. Victoria's growing closeness to Annabel makes her less willing to play with Mama, unlike Lilly. Dreyfuss visits the cabin and is killed by Mama, with Annabel taking some of the objects relating to Mama, including the body of her baby. Annabel and the girls are attacked by a jealous Mama, who kills Jean, who has been watching the house, and uses her body to spirit the children away in Jean's car. Annabel and Lucas find the children on the same cliff where Brennan leaped with her child to their deaths over a century earlier. Mama is preparing to re-enact her fall with Victoria and Lilly.

When Annabel offers Mama the remains of her child, Mama's appearance changes, becoming more human, and she starts sobbing at the baby's death. However, when Lilly (remembering only Mama as her original parent, since she was abandoned in the woods for most of her life) calls out for her, Mama reverts to her monstrous form and takes the girls again, nearly killing Annabel and Lucas, but refraining mainly because Victoria cares about them and does not want them hurt. Annabel clings to Victoria, who asks to stay with Annabel instead of leaving with Mama, which Mama accepts. After a tearful farewell, Mama and Lilly fall off the cliff, turning into a shower of moths when they hit the branch. Mama and Lilly are shown as spirits happy to be united while embracing and smiling.  Annabel and Lucas embrace Victoria, and Victoria notices a bright blue moth landing on her hand, indicating that Lilly is still with her in some form.

The film began production in [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] on 3 October 2011. Production ended on 18 December 2011. Parts of the film were also shot in [[Quebec City, Quebec]].

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Mama'' received generally positive reviews from critics; it currently holds a 64% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 154 reviews. The site's consensus states: "If you're into old school scares over cheap gore, you'll be able to get over ''Mama''{{'}}s confusing script and contrived plot devices."<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|mama_2013|Mama}}</ref>

[[Richard Roeper]], writing for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', enjoyed the film, giving it three stars out of four and saying, "Movies like ''Mama'' are thrill rides. We go to be scared and then laugh, scared and then laugh, scared and then shocked. Of course, there's almost always a little plot left over for a sequel. It's a ride I'd take again."<ref>{{cite news |last= Roeper |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Roeper |title= ''Mama'' |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |location= Chicago |publisher= [[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date= 16 January 2013  |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20130116/REVIEWS/130119994/1023 |accessdate= 6 February 2013}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]], reviewing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', gave the movie a B and said, "''Mama'' lifts almost every one of its fear-factor visuals from earlier films: the rotting black passageways that spread like mold over the walls (very ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'' meets ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'')the fire in her eyes; the crouched figures that skitter and pounce à la the infamous 'spider' outtake from the original ''[[The Exorcist (film)|Exorcist]]''; the way that Mama, with her arms like smoky-shadowy bent tendrils, evokes both the monster from the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films and also, in a funny way, the crumpled-[[puppet]] gothic mischievousness of [[Tim Burton]] animation. Nothing in the movie is quite original, yet Muschietti, expanding his original short,<ref>https://www.youtube.com/mamathemovie</ref> knows how to stage a rip-off with frightening verve. It helps to have an actress on hand as soulful as [[Jessica Chastain]]..."<ref>{{cite journal |url= |last= Gleiberman |first= Owen |authorlink= Owen Gleiberman |title= Mama |journal=  [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= 25 January – 1 February 2013 |location= New York |publisher= Time Inc. |page= 98}}</ref>

[[IGN]] editor Scott Corulla rated the film 7.3 out of 10 and wrote, "This is a fine first film for director Andrés Muschietti and, despite some missteps and disappointments, very well could be a harbinger of interesting things to come for the helmer."<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/17/mama-review</ref> ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' wrote, "With Del Toro's name up front, expect ''Mama'' to be the winter horror film of choice in 2013."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/13/mama-trailer-jessica-chastain_n_1882016.html |author= |date= 13 September 2012 |title= 'Mama' Trailer: Jessica Chastain Stars In Year's Scariest Film?

The atmosphere is positively spectral. And it's easy to see why del Toro is a champion: Like his ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'', there's a fairy-tale aspect (the film even begins with the title card "Once upon a time..."), with children in jeopardy, a [[Witchcraft|witchy]] monster, and edge-of-the-precipice confrontations."<ref>{{cite news |last= Rea |first= Steven |title= ''Mama'': Every Adoptive Parent's Nightmare |work=  [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |location= Philadelphia |publisher= Philadelphia Media Network |date= 18 January 2013 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> ''[[Canyon News]]'' wrote, "The scares do indeed come a mile a minute and will unnerve even some of the toughest moviegoers."<ref>{{cite news |last= Anderson |first= LaDale |title= ''Mama'' Is Spine-Tingling Scary |work= [[Canyon News]] |location= Beverly Hills, California |publisher= Glen Kelly |date= 17 January 2013 |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> Mick LaSalle of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' wrote, "Director Andres Muschietti is cinematically literate&nbsp;– in one example he borrows a flashbulb effect from [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' – and he has visual panache.
