'''''JeruZalem''''' is a 2015 [[Israel]]i [[supernatural horror film]].

== Plot ==
In 1972, two priests are called to record an event at Jerusalem. It is revealed that [[Jewish]], [[Muslim]], and [[Christian]] priests were all called to perform an exorcism on a woman who died three days before. Her son claims she was calm at first when she returned from the grave to his home, but became violent later, injuring her husband. After failed attempts to cure her, the priests decide they have no choice but to kill the woman. In a final attempt, the woman screams while sprouting leather wings, just before a priest kills her with a [[derringer]]. The narrator states that the strange events of 1972 were the "first proof" of a gateway to Hell in Jerusalem. 
 
In the present, two Jewish American tourists, Rachel Klein (Yael Grobglas) and Sarah Pullman (Danielle Jadelyn), plan a vacation to [[Tel Aviv]]. Sarah's father gives her a [[Google Glass]], and the rest of the movie is taken from the Glass's [[POV shot|POV]]. On the plane, they meet a fellow American student named Kevin Reed (Yon Tumarkin). Kevin is fascinated by religious mythology, especially the Jinns  of Islam, the [[Golem]] of Jewish mythology, and the undead or [[zombie]]s, which he believes to all be manifestations of the same evil. He suggests that Rachel and Sarah join him on his journey to Jerusalem, and mentions that he wants to spend [[Yom Kippur]] there. Sarah becomes infatuated with Kevin and convinces her friend to go to Jerusalem. On their way to the hostel, they meet a local who believes that he is [[David|King David]]. The local warns them to leave the city because it's dangerous, warning that something terrible will happen on Yom Kippur, but the friends believe he is insane. 

In the hostel they meet Omar (Tom Graziani) and his father Fauzi, who run the hostel. The local news channel reports of a murder that has taken place in the Old City with a massive amount of blood found on the street, but no body. While Rachel starts an affair with Omar, Kevin and Sarah grow closer. The four friends enjoy their time in Jerusalem, party, and tour the city. When Sarah gets lost in the Old City at night, she is frightened of an unearthly growling and screams she hears. Kevin shows Sarah a documentary he found on the internet with film footage of the 1972 exorcism. 
  
When they visit the [[Western Wall]], Sarah wishes for her recently dead brother Joel to return. As soon as she [[Placing notes in the Western Wall|puts the paper into the Wall]], a swarm of black birds fly overhead. The four friends leave to tour [[Zedekiah's Cave|Solomon's Quarries]]. There, Kevin sees drawings of black angels on the wall, feels nervous, and leaves to research the drawings in the city's archives. While Sarah joins him, Rachel and Omar stay at the quarries. After investigating, Kevin warns Sarah to leave the city, because after this day "there won't be a tomorrow." Sarah also thinks that there is something strange going on, but Rachel refuses to leave.

Kevin insists on leaving, but Omar and his father believe that Kevin is [[Jerusalem syndrome|crazy]] and send him to a [[mental asylum]]. Later at night, Sarah witnesses Israeli military planes bomb parts of the city. The local media reports it as a potential terrorist attack and that the inhabitants should leave Jerusalem. Sarah tries to rescue Kevin from the asylum, but Rachel and Omar, being escorted by two Israeli soldiers, refuse to stop and insist that they keep moving. Sarah convinces the soldiers to help her free Kevin.

In the asylum, Sarah finds and frees Kevin. She also meets the man who claims to be King David, who reveals himself to be the son of the possessed woman who was killed in 1972. They manage to escape and meet Omar, his father, and Rachel at the city walls. However, the gates are closed and the city is under quarantine. Anyone who tries to leave is brutally shot down. The four friends don't want to give up on their escape, and Omar's father suggests sneaking out through underwater caves he knew as a child.

On their way there, they are met by demons who attack the civilians, biting and/or scratching to infect them as well as eat their flesh. Kevin believes that the doors to hell have somehow been opened and that the [[End time|End of Days]] has begun. Sarah soon realizes that Rachel has been infected as well when she is scratched by a demon. Kevin warns Sarah that Rachel's condition is contagious and that she will eventually change and attack them. However, Sarah convinces Kevin to take Rachel with them and have her see a doctor once they escape from the city.

In the caves, Rachel's condition worsens. Demons begin to attack the friends and Rachel transforms, her eyes turning black. Sarah falls down and Rachel regains control over herself, warning Sarah to run before killing herself. Sarah accidentally kills Omar's father with a sword taken from a statue, and when Omar realizes what happened, he commits suicide rather than being changed into a demon or be eaten alive by the creatures, leaving Kevin and Sarah alone. They meet a creature with white wings who turns out to be Sarah's brother Joel returned as an angel. Joel leads them from the caves. Upon reaching the other side of the wall, Sarah realizes that she has many scratches similar to Rachel's on her legs and arms. She turns into a demon and flies into the air, while Kevin looks on in horror.

In the final shot, thousands of demons are seen flying above Jerusalem as military helicopters surround the scene and fires burn throughout the city.<ref> Jeruzalem Movie</ref>

== Critical reception ==
{{rewrite section|date=October 2016}}
{{Quote|Continuing Israeli cinema's recent trend of homegrown genre films, JeruZalem doesn't exactly break any new stylistic ground. Its use of Israeli performers results in some jarringly bad attempts at American accents, and the film clearly suffers from its low-budget limitations. But the creepy evocativeness of its superbly utilized setting (the filmmakers reportedly shot on the sly, at times claiming to be working on a documentary), and the well-realized creature designs make it a more-than-respectable horror effort. The haunting final shot alone makes it worth the price of admission.|Frank Scheck (Filmjournal)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/reviews/film-review-jeruzalem |title=Film Review: Jeruzalem. You'll think twice before booking that vacation trip to the Holy City. |work=filmjournal.com |author=Frank Scheck |date=12 January 2016 |accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|"JeruZalem" is just a wobble-a-thon with incessant screaming and a predictable trajectory for its leading ladies, even if the final, arresting image of a malevolently transformed skyline makes one wish a more enticing, original road had led there.|Robert Abele ([[Los Angeles Times]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-cap-jeruzalem-review-20160122-story.html |title=Review 'JeruZalem' Israeli horror film suffers in a found-footage purgatory. |work=latimes.com |author=Robert Abele |date=22 January 2016 |accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref>}}

{{Quote|JeruZalem nails the sense of place and weightiness loaned to the story by its unique location, but fails to make the grade elsewhere – leaving it little more than another POV spook-house simulator that ultimately isn’t worth the time spent.|Gareth Jones (Dread Central)<ref>{{cite web|author1=Gareth Jones|title=JeruZalem (2015) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/123537/jeruzalem-2015/|accessdate=4 October 2016|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>}}
