{{More plot|date=December 2014}}
''Freakshow'' portrays a gang of thieves, working as security guards in a traveling carnival, who plot to steal their rich owner's fortune.

Lucy, one of the thieves, attempts to take the fortune by herself by seducing the Boss and marrying him. The youngest member of the Freakshow, Kimmie stumbles across a few of the gang members stealing food and she is murdered by the thieves. When the murder is discovered, the freaks plot revenge. In a variety of gruesome ways, the thieves are murdered by the freaks. Lucy attempts to escape punishment by swearing her love for the carnival Boss. The freaks "spare" her by giving her a freakshow "act" which will make her a full member of their troop. They mutilate her, cut out her tongue, sew her mouth shut, strip her flesh, and cut off her limbs small parts at a time and finally display her in the Freakshow Gallery as "The Worm Girl".

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Critical reception for the film has been mostly negative. 
''Horror News.net'' gave the film a negative review stating, "Freakshow is not a movie I recommend, not because it is controversial, but because it is watered down and bland. That being said, Iâ€™m not against giving the writer and/or director another shot if I see their names on a different movie; we all make mistakes, and hopefully we learn from our biggest ones".<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: Freakshow (2007)|url=http://horrornews.net/80626/film-review-freakshow-2007/|website=HorrorNews.net|author=seanofthedead|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>
''Eat Horror'' panned the film, calling the film's acting and script "awful", also criticizing the film's unsympathetic characters, and over the top gore.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freakshow|url=http://www.eathorror.com/freakshow.php|website=EatHorror.net|publisher=Eat Horror|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>
