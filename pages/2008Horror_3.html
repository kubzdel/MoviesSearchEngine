It’s simply awful, really awful, “Oh, my god, I cannot believe I saw this in a theater” awful; the kind of awful that actually transcends awfulness and becomes entertaining in spite of itself. This is one for the ages. I haven’t laughed out loud this much at a movie in a long time.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/7489/13th-alley-the-2008/|title=13th Alley, The (2008) (review)|last=|first=|date=2008-06-19|website=Dread Central|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}</ref>
