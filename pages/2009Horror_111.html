==Plot==
{{expand-section|the rest of the plot|date=April 2015}}
Five strangers wake in a dim, dry well with no memory of how they got there. Grant ([[Linden Ashby]]) is the intrepid, leader-type. Jordan ([[Lori Heuring]]), a surgeon, is the group's moral compass. The younger Anna (Lea Kohl) is [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] and willing to do anything to survive. Luke (Joe Egender) is an insane-yet-rational [[Darwinist]] who's only looking out for himself. Alex (Julian Rojas) is a timid outsider on the verge of breaking down.

When a note attached to a scalpel informs them that the average person can survive for, at most, 30 days without food, they realize to their horror what their captor wants them to do. As days go by and endeavours to escape prove futile, the inviolable becomes a distinct prospect. All the while, a scientist with a history observes from his study.
