'''''Pervert!''''' is a 2005 comedy horror film directed by [[Jonathan Yudis]]. It is mainly a tribute to the films of [[Russ Meyer]].

==Plot==
[[College student]] James (Andrews) arrives from [[New Orleans]] at a desert [[ranch]] owned by his father, Hezekiah ([[Darrell Sandeen|Sandeen]]) to help out. Soon after arriving, James is hit on by Hezekiah's wife, Cheryl ([[Mary Carey (actress)|Carey]]), and starts having nightmares. James and Cheryl are caught by Hezekiah having [[sexual intercourse|sex]], Cheryl and Hezekiah have a fight, then she leaves the ranch that night.

Hezekiah drives into town and picks up another woman, Alisha ([[Sally Jean]]), who also quickly falls for James then disappears. Cheryl staggers into Hezekiah's "studio" (an [[art workshop]] where he makes female body sculptures out of [[meat]]), and dies in front of James. He takes her into the house, where he finds his father crying over Alisha's dead body.

James calls a [[care facility]] because he thinks his dad has gone crazy. They send out a nurse, Patty ([[Juliette Clarke|Clarke]]), who [[handcuffs]] Hezekiah to his bed so that the next time somebody is killed, he can be eliminated as a suspect. In the few days of waiting for the next victim to show up, Patty and James decide to while away the time by having sex.

James reveals to Patty that he went to a [[witch doctor]] ([[Edmund Johnson|Johnson]]) back in New Orleans to help him with attracting females but was misled; his [[penis]] can now detach itself from his body and kill people.

A side story involves a sexually confused local [[mechanic]] ([[Jonathan Yudis|Yudis]], the film's producer and director) and his probably intentional delay in fixing James's car, in order to seduce him.
