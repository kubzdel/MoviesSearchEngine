==Plot==
Samuel Peters ([[Edward Furlong]]), once an ordinary man, dabbles in the laws of [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] to bring his wife back from the grave. He soon encounters the god of malevolence, [[Kalfu]] ([[Corey Feldman]]), and makes a pact with him to destroy the underworld and bring chaos to earth. In return, he will become the Zombie King and walk the earth for eternity with his late wife. But as the growing horde of zombies begins to wipe out a countryside town, the government creates a perimeter around the town and employs a shoot-on-sight policy. Trapped within the town, the locals, an unlikely bunch of misfits, must fight for their lives and unite in order to survive.
