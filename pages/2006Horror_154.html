==Plot==
Ting-yin, a young [[novelist]], is struggling to come up with a followup to her best-selling trilogy of romance novels. She has not even started on the book yet and her agent has already announced that the next title, ''The Recycle'', will deal with the [[supernatural]].

After drafting her first chapter, she stops and deletes the file from her computer. She then starts seeing strange, unexplainable things and finds that she is experiencing the supernatural events that she described in her novel-to-be.

==Cast==
* [[Angelica Lee]] as Ting-yin/Chu Xun
* [[Lawrence Chou]] as Abby
* [[Siu-Ming Lau]]
* [[Rain Li]]
* [[Jetrin Wattanasin]]
* [[Cheang Pou-soi]]

==Controversy==
Ting-yin finds herself in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] where abandoned things end up, including [[abortion|aborted]] [[fetus]]es, which combined with the portrayal of the main character's personal demons regarding her own aborted child leads some critics to believe the film carries a pro-life message. "That just happens to be one of the topics in the movie. We are not out to say if abortion is right or wrong", Oxide Pang said in one interview.<ref>Tan, Jeanine (6 July 2006), [http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/217513/1/.html "It's a horror film, not a crusade"], [[Channel NewsAsia]].</ref>
