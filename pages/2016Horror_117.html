The filmmakers were inspired to make the movie after learning of the existence of the "Zone of Death", a small portion of [[Yellowstone National Park]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/tn-dpt-me-0423-population-zero-20160422-story.html|title='Population Zero,' debuting at film festival, explores the Zone of Death|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref> that under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]]'s [[Vicinage Clause]], would enable "[[Vicinage Clause#The perfect crime.3F|The Perfect Crime]]".<ref name=Kalt/> The Zone was first written about in a ''[[Georgetown Law Journal]]'' article, "The Perfect Crime," by [[Michigan State University law]] professor [[Brian C.

== Synopsis ==
The film is a "[[mockumentary]]" examining the history of Dwayne Nelson, a suspected murderer. In 2009, Nelson confessed to shooting three men to death in Yellowstone National Park and despite his confession being accurately detailed, he was not convicted of the crimes because the crime occurred in an uninhabited area and as such, there is no chance of finding a jury to hear the trial. Years later [[Julian T. Pinder]] examines the crimes and the legal loophole that allowed Nelson to walk free. As the film progresses Pinder begins to receive strange and frightening items, evidence of Nelson's crime.

== Reception ==
In its opening week in Canada, the film grossed [[C$]]3841 from 15 theatres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2017/05/16/hot-sheet-top-5-canadian-films-may-5-to-11-2017/|title=Hot Sheet: Top 5 Canadian films May 5 to 11, 2017|date=May 16, 2017|accessdate=August 26, 2017|work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]]|publisher=Brunico Communications}}</ref>

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that although the film was uneven in places it was also "creatively eerie".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/population-zero-newport-beach-review-885160|title='Population Zero': Newport Beach Review|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref> Shock Till You Drop praised the movie, commenting that "Knowing that ''POPULATION ZERO'' is a hypothetical scenario played out is immaterial. The question of whether the film is real or not is not the point. The point is that the federal government recognizes that there is a “Zone of Death” in one of its national Parks, making this film far more unsettling and disturbing than anything to spring from one’s imagination."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/402917-review-chilling-mock-doc-population-zero/#/slide/1|title=Review: Chilling Mock-Doc POPULATION ZERO|last=Jackson|first=Camilla|date=2016-05-01|website=Shock Till You Drop|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-02}}</ref>
