==Synopsis==
The film follows a film crew over a long weekend during the summer solstice at the [[St Marys Church, Clophill|St Marys Church]] in [[Clophill]], which has long been rumored to be a supernatural hot spot.<ref name=wht /> On the first day a film crew spend their time interviewing various locals and witnesses to events up at the ruin. They are told that the church was home to black magic rituals and that one in 1963 involved the bones of a corpse from the late 1700s. The following day the crew chooses to investigate the surrounding cemetery in hopes of finding a ghost and are joined by a paranormal investigation group. Fearing that they will be bothered by people intent on vandalizing the property, they also decide to hire a security team.

On the third day the crew witness a group in the woods drumming, but do not approach them. Later that night the crew chooses to take turns monitoring one of the locations where supernatural activity allegedly took place, resulting in a number of strange events, including a sinister face seen watching them. The police arrive and two of the crew decide to investigate beyond the church into the woods and stumble upon a black magic ceremony and are forced to flee. The following day the police are unable to find any trace of the ritual. The remaining crew members go home, however Criselda and Craig find that their daughter is behaving oddly and is in contact with a hostile spirit.
