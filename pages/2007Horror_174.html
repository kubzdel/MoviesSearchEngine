==Critical response==
Reviews were generally enthusiastic. LA Splash said Hughes gave "a truly magnetic Manson vibe the entire time, allowing director Adam Wingard to make great use of the extreme close-up". ''[[The Grudge]]'' screenwriter [[Stephen Susco]] remarked that it was "unlike any horror film you've ever seen - or will ever see..." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the movie "powerful" and suggested it created "a new genre: acid horror."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Pop Skull|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/reviews/pop-skull-1200554361/|year=2007}}</ref>
