'''''Cry Baby Lane''''' (original teaser title: '''''Someone Wants to Meet You''''') is a 2000 [[television film]] that premiered on [[Nickelodeon]] on the night of October 28, 2000. The film was never aired outside the United States nor [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into other languages. It wouldn't be rebroadcast until 2011 and has never received a home media release. Similar to the 2003 Nickelodeon film ''[[The Electric Piper]]'', this film was also considered a [[lost film]] for over a decade since its original airing from 2000 during SNICK's Halloween special that was hosted by [[Melissa Joan Hart]]. It was widely believed to be withheld from rerelease because of controversies surrounding this film, but a Nickelodeon representative stated that the film had been merely forgotten. In 2011, a copy was discovered on [[Reddit]] and the ensuing reaction prompted [[TeenNick]] to re-air the film on October 31, 2011.<ref>{{cite news |author=Kimberly Potts |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nickelodeon-idUSTRE79R69620111028 |title=Nickelodeon airing "banned" movie on Halloween |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=October 28, 2011 |access-date=March 1, 2016}}</ref>

In its original U.S. airing, this TV movie was rated [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-Y7]]. It was re-rated TV-PG-V for moderate violence on its rerelease and in 2016, it was once again rerated to TV-G.

==Plot==
Andrew ([[Glint|Jase Blankfort]]) and his older brother Carl (Trey Rogers) enjoy listening to ghost stories that the local undertaker, Mr. Bennett ([[Frank Langella]]), tells them. One night Bennett tells the tale of a local farmer whose wife gave birth to [[conjoined twins]], one being good-natured while the other was clearly evil. The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the twins locked in their room. Eventually the twins got sick from a liver disease and died together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a [[cemetery]] and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house, at the end of an old dirt road called Cry Baby Lane, as whoever is caught out there at night will hear the cries of the deceased twin. Later, Andrew, Carl, and a group of friends decide to hold a [[séance]] in the cemetery where the good twin is buried, but soon after the seance, a creepy phenomenon occurs around the town. When Andrew consults Mr. Bennett about it, he confesses that when the twins were separated, the farmer mixed up the twins and tossed the good one in the field and that the good twin is crying for help, not vengeance, and the bad twin possesses nearly everyone in town, and it is up to Andrew to stop him.

However, during the time Andrew and Carl journey into Cry Baby Lane, the evil twin intervenes and possesses Carl who then tries to attack his brother. The evil twin, speaking for Carl, tells Andrew he can't stop his doing as the cries of the good twin become louder and more desperate. Andrew eventually escapes the car and journeys into the good twin's grave where he must cut a root that was wrapped the good twin's skeleton in order to regain peace. The evil twin showers dirt onto the grave, attempting to bury Andrew alive, but Andrew manages to cut the root and save the good twin. The evil twin disappears in a flash of light and everybody returns to normal.

The next day, Andrew wakes up outside of the grave where he finds the good twin's grave with flowers, alluding that the twin is now at peace. Andrew then picks a flower from the grave and gives it to Kathy as they leave Cry Baby Lane.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/crybabylane_v268375/plotsummary|title=Cry Baby Lane Synopsis - Plot Summary - Fandango.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|author=|date=|website=Fandango.com|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/268375/Cry-Baby-Lane/details|title=details|author=|date=|website=AMCTV.com|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://demo-ent.mobile.msn.com/en-us/entmovie.aspx?mid=526779|title=MSN.com - Hotmail, Outlook, Skype, Bing, Latest News, Photos & Videos|author=|date=|website=demo-ent.mobile.MSN.com|access-date=May 7, 2017}}</ref>

==Production==
[[File:FrankLangella07TIFF.jpg|thumb|Nickelodeon insisted on the casting of Frank Langella for the role of the caretaker.]]The film was originally envisioned as $10 million theatrical release for Nickelodeon, but it was instead ordered to be a made-for-television movie with a budget of $800,000. The film was shot in the Village of Kingston in [[New Jersey]] in a little over twenty days with an extra day of shooting in Ohio for shots of the town. The director originally wanted [[Tom Waits]] for the role of the caretaker, but Nickelodeon insisted on [[Frank Langella]] in hopes that it would garner extra publicity.<ref name="Lost and found">{{cite web |author=Nicholas Deleon |url=http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/08/13/081311-tech-news-crybaby-1-2 |title=Lost and found: Fans’ track-down of banned Nickelodeon movie flatters director |website=thedaily.com |date=August 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204104051/http://www.thedaily.com/page/2011/08/13/081311-tech-news-crybaby-1-2 |archivedate=February 4, 2013 |df= }} </ref>

==Availability==
After its 2000 broadcast, Nickelodeon never released the film or re-aired it for over a decade. ''Cry Baby Lane'' was thought to be a [[lost film]] and gained a large [[cult following]] due to its obscurity. A search began for the lost film, and in August 2011, the user Firesaladpeach from the website [[Reddit]] recovered a [[VHS]] copy recorded from the film's original broadcast on the night of October 28th, 2000 and made it available online. Director [[Peter Lauer]] was interviewed soon after and said that he was surprised and flattered by the attention his film had gotten 11 years after its original release, being unaware of its supposed banning by Nickelodeon: "I just assumed they didn't show it again because they didn't like it! I did it, I thought it failed, and I moved on."<ref name="Lost and found"/> A Nickelodeon representative later claimed that the film was never banned; it was just forgotten.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nickelodeon-idUSTRE79R69620111028|title=Nickelodeon airing "banned" movie on Halloween|author=|date=October 28, 2011|publisher=|access-date=May 7, 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>

The reaction from Reddit, as well as the success of ''[[The '90s Are All That]]'', prompted [[TeenNick]] to re-air ''Cry Baby Lane'' on the night of October 31, 2011. It reran again on March 31, 2015, as part of a week of specials on ''[[The '90s Are All That]]''.<ref name="Reuters"/> It was promoted as being banned from television.<ref name="Banned">http://www.nick.com/videos/clip/90s-are-all-that-cry-baby-lane-clip.html {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref> On October 31, 2015, it was rerun on the block, now called [[The Splat]].
