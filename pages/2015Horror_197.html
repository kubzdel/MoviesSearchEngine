'''''The Visit''''' is a 2015 American [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]  [[horror film]] written, co-produced and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/11/12/m-night-shyamalan-the-visit-2015|title=M. Night Shyamalan's next thriller 'The Visit' set for 2015 release|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=November 12, 2014}}</ref> and starring [[Olivia DeJonge]], [[Ed Oxenbould]], [[Deanna Dunagan]], [[Peter McRobbie]], and [[Kathryn Hahn]].

The film was released in North America on September 11, 2015 by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film received overall mixed to positive reviews, and some viewed it as a comeback for Shyamalan. It was a box office success, grossing $98.5 million worldwide against its $5 million budget.

==Plot==
Two siblings from Philadelphia, 15-year-old Becca and 13-year-old Tyler, prepare for a five-day visit with their grandparents while their divorced mother Loretta goes on a cruise with her boyfriend. Loretta reveals that she has not spoken to her parents in 15 years after marrying her high school teacher, of whom her parents disapproved. Having never met their grandparents, the teenagers intend to record a documentary film about their visit using a camcorder.

Becca and Tyler meet their grandparents, referred to as "Nana" and "Pop Pop", at a train station. When they arrive at their isolated farmhouse, Becca and Tyler are instructed to never go into the basement because it contains mold, and that bedtime is at 9:30 every evening, after which they shouldn't leave their room. The first night, an hour past curfew, Becca ventures downstairs for something to eat and sees Nana projectile vomiting all over the house, which frightens her. She tells Pop Pop, who dismisses it as Nana having the stomach flu. He then reminds her not to leave their bedroom after 9:30 pm.

Over the next few days, Becca and Tyler notice their grandparents exhibiting more strange and disturbing behavior. Tyler walks into Pop Pop's shed and finds a huge pile of soiled adult diapers. Becca asks Nana about the day Loretta left home, and Nana begins to shake and scream. Later, Pop Pop and Nana are confronted by a woman they helped in counseling, and she goes into the backyard with them but is never seen leaving. Concerned about the events, Tyler decides to secretly film what happens downstairs at night, but Nana discovers the hidden camera, retrieves a large knife, and tries unsuccessfully to break into the children's locked bedroom.

When Becca and Tyler view the camera footage of Nana with the knife, they contact Loretta and beg her to come get them. They show her images of her parents, and she panics and says they are not her parents. Realizing that they have been with strangers all week, the teenagers try to leave the house, but Nana and Pop Pop trap them inside and force them to play [[Yahtzee]]. Later, Becca sneaks into the basement and finds the corpses of her real grandparents, along with uniforms from the mental hospital at which they worked, revealing the impostors as escaped patients. Pop Pop grabs Becca and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana, who tries to eat her. He then starts to torment Tyler psychologically by smearing his face with his dirty diaper. Becca fatally stabs Nana with a glass shard from a broken mirror, then runs into the kitchen and attacks Pop Pop. As Pop Pop starts to gain the upper hand, Tyler knocks him to the floor and kills him by repeatedly slamming the refrigerator door onto his head. The teens escape outside unharmed, where they are met by their mother and police officers.

In the aftermath, Becca asks Loretta about what happened the day she left home. Loretta states that she had a major argument with her parents, during which she hit her mother and was then struck by her father. Loretta then left home and ignored their attempts to contact her. Loretta concludes that reconciliation was always possible had she wanted it. She then tells Becca not to hold on to anger over her father's abandonment.

Shyamalan admitted that he had trouble keeping the tone for the film consistent during the editing phase, telling [[Bloody Disgusting]] that the first cut of the film resembled an [[Art house|art house film]] more than a horror film. A second cut went in the opposite direction and the film became a comedy. He eventually struck a middle balance and cut the film as a thriller, which, according to him, helped tie the different elements together as they "could stay in service of the movie".<ref name=truehorror>{{cite web|title=[Interview] M.

Scott Mendelson from ''[[Forbes]]'' called Shyamalan's film a "deliciously creepy and funny little triumph". He also wrote, "''The Visit'' is the one we've been waiting for, folks. It's good. Oh my word, is it good. But more importantly, it is excellent in that specific way that reminds us why M. Night Shyamalan was once such a marvel. It is richly humanistic, filled with individually sketched characters that often sparkle with wit and surprising decency."<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/09/09/review-m-night-shyamalans-the-visit-is-a-glorious-return-to-form|title=M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Visit' Is A Glorious Return To Form|website=Forbes|accessdate= September 18, 2015}}</ref> In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Manohla Dargis]] described the film as "an amusingly-grim fairy tale". Shyamalan has gone back to basics, "with a stripped-down story and scale, a largely-unknown (excellent) cast and one of those classically-tinged tales of child peril that have reliably spooked audiences for generations".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/movies/review-the-visit-is-hansel-and-gretel-with-less-candy-and-more-camcorders.html?&_r=1|title=Review: 'The Visit' Is ‘Hansel and Gretel' With Less Candy and More Camcorders|website=The New York Times|accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>  She, along with other critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parallax-view.org/2015/09/10/film-review-the-visit/|title=Film Review: The Visit|first=Kathleen|last=Murphy|date=September 10, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-visit-2015|title=The Visit Movie Review & Film Summary (2015) - Roger Ebert|first=Sheila|last=O'Malley|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref> saw the film as a modern-day version of the classic fairytale [[Hansel and Gretel]].

In his column for ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Mark Kermode]] panned the film, saying it may be worse than ''[[Lady in the Water]]''. He wrote, "Is it meant to be a horror film? Or a comedy? The publicity calls it 'an original thriller' but it is neither of those things. Only 'endurance test' adequately describes the ill-judged shenanigans that ensue."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/13/the-visit-review-ill-judged-shenanigans-shyamalan|title=Review: 'ill-judged shenanigans from M Night Shyamalan'|website=The Guardian|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref> Mike McCahill gave the film one star (out of five) in his review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', and said it was "[d]ull, derivative and flatly unscary."<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/10/the-visit-review-m-night-shyamalans-found-footage-loser|title=Review: 'M Night Shyamalan's found-footage loser'|website=The Guardian|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}</ref>
