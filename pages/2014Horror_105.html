==Synopsis==
Wesley (Harley Neville) couldn't be happier- he has managed to land a job as a [[Television_crew#Runner|runner]] for an upcoming horror film, ''Tonight They Come''. He also feels that he's met the girl of his dreams in the set caterer Susan (Jocelyn Christian), which makes things that much better. The only problem is that the director seems keen on using Wesley as a [[whipping boy]] to vent his frustrations and to make matters worse, the film's extras all seem to have become zombies intent on killing them all.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''I Survived a Zombie Holocaust'' has been positive.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Luke|title=Film4 FrightFest Review – I Survived a Zombie Holocaust (2014)|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2014/08/film4-frightfest-review-survived-zombie-holocaust-2014.html|publisher=Flickering Myth|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> ''Grolsch Film Works'' and ''Nerdly'' both praised the film, with ''Grolsch Film Works'' stating "More or less immunising itself against charges of unoriginality by constantly offering reflexive commentary on its own movie-bound qualities (or lack thereof), Pigden's film is an affectionate trawl though the mechanics of the modern zombie picture."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=I SURVIVED A ZOMBIE HOLOCAUST (review)|url=http://grolschfilmworks.com/ca/reviews/i-survived-a-zombie-holocaust|publisher=Grolsch Film Works|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=Frightfest 2014: ‘I Survived a Zombie Holocaust’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2014/08/23/frightfest-2014-i-survived-a-zombie-holocaust-review/|publisher=Nerdly|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[SciFiNow]]'' was more critical in their review, writing "This well-intentioned horror comedy gets a few laughs and the cast are game (Ben Baker is particularly fun as ex-rugby player and glory-days obsessed Tane) but there’s not really too much going on here beyond the meta zombie movie jokes. One or two sequences work very well (such as the director convincing his first AD to literally sacrifice himself for the art) but it’s overlong at 100-odd minutes and it struggles to find jokes beyond the self-referential. It’s difficult to criticise a film this amiable too harshly, but it’s not particularly funny."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hatfull|first1=Jonathan|title=FRIGHTFEST 2014 DAY 3 REVIEW: LOVED TO DEATH|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/frightfest-2014-day-3-review-loved-to-death/|publisher=SciFiNow|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>
