'''''Ju-on: The Grudge''''' is a 2002 [[Japanese horror|Japanese]] [[supernatural horror film]] written and directed by [[Takashi Shimizu]]. This film is the third installment in the [[Ju-on (franchise)|''Ju-on'' series]] and the first film to be theatrically released (the first two entries being direct-to-video productions). The film premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival in October 2002 and has spawned several sequels and an American remake titled ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', which was released in 2004. The film was followed by ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge 2]]''.

==Plot ==
{{hatnote|The following events are explained in their actual order; the original film is presented in a nonlinear narrative.}}

Several years prior to the main plot, [[Takeo Saeki]] murders his wife [[Kayako Saeki|Kayako]] after discovering she is in love with another man, also killing the family cat Mar and possibly his son [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]]. The murders create a curse that revives the family as [[onryō]], with Kayako’s ghost murdering Takeo. Whoever enters the house in [[Nerima]], [[Tokyo]], is eventually consumed by the curse, which spreads to the place they die in and in turn consumes anyone who goes there.

The latest owners of the house are the Tokunaga family, consisting of [[salaryman]] Katsuya, his wife Kazumi, and his ill mother Sachie. Kazumi is quickly consumed by the curse, and Katsuya is emotionally affected by Takeo’s personality before dying too. Katsuya’s sister Hitomi dies shortly after Kayako’s spirit follows her to her office and then her apartment. [[Social worker]] Rika is sent by her boss Hirohashi to care for Sachie. She discovers Toshio, and witnesses Sachie being killed by Kayako’s ghost, causing her to faint.

Hirohashi finds Rika and contacts the police. Detectives Nakagawa and Igarashi discover Katsuya and Kazumi’s bodies in the attic, and later learn of Hitomi’s disappearance and the death of a security guard at her workplace. Hirohashi’s body is discovered, and Rika is haunted by the ghosts. Upon researching the history of the house and the Saeki murders, Nakagawa and Igarashi contact a retired detective named Toyama, who is afraid of revisiting the case. Toyama goes to burn the house down but hears a group of teenage girls upstairs. One flees while the others are consumed. Kayako appears, chasing Toyama away but killing Nakagawa and Igarashi.

Some time after visiting the house, Rika has moved on with her life. Her friend Mariko, an elementary school teacher, pays a visit to Toshio, who is registered as her student but has never shown up for class. Rika races to save her but is too late. Kayako’s ghost comes after her, and Rika witnesses Kayako briefly take on her appearance. She realizes that she is doomed to play out the curse and the same fate as Kayako. With Toshio watching from the banisters, Takeo’s ghost descends the stages and kills her.

In the deserted [[Tokyo]] streets, many [[missing person]]s posters lie on the ground. Rika’s corpse lies in the house’s attic, only to reawaken with a [[death rattle]]. Elsewhere, Toyama dies at some point and leaves his daughter Izumi behind. As a teenager, Izumi went to the house with her friends but fled while her friends were killed by Kayako; this was the event Toyama witnessed in the past.

Izumi is wrought with guilt for abandoning her friends and becomes increasingly paranoid and unstable. Two of her other friends visit her and discover Izumi and her dead friends have their eyes blackened out in photos. Izumi encounters a vision of her dead father, then discovers the ghosts of her friends watching her. She is cornered by her dead friends, only for Kayako to appear and drag her into damnation.

In 2004, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] released an American [[The Grudge (2004 film)|remake]] of the film.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
At [[Metacritic]], a website which assigns a [[Standard score|normalised]] rating out of 100 for reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 48, based on 22 reviews indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-grudge-2004|work=[[Metacritic]]|title=Ju-on: The Grudge|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film a mixed reviewing, stating that it "isn't particularly scary. No, it's much harder on you than mere fright: It's . . . creepy" and "it lacks any interest in conventional narrative and doesn't bother with hero or heroine, or with any sense of coherency, of any mechanism of solution of its mystery."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34255-2004Oct15.html|work=[[Washington Post]]|title='Ju-On': It's Sure To Give You The Creeps|date=15 October 2004|accessdate=27 September 2014|last=Hunter|first=Stephen}}</ref> [[David Kehr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the film unfavorably to ''[[Ring (film)|The Ring]]'' (1998), opining that ''Ju-on: The Grudge'' "turns into a rote series of killings, with each new sequence introduced by a title with the name of its primary victim. Because there is a new hero to identify with every 10 minutes, the viewer isn't drawn into a sustained suspense, but is merely subjected to a series of more or less foreseeable shocks."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2004/07/23/movies/23JUON.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Beware the Ghosts in the Closet (and Virtually Everywhere Else)|date=23 July 2004|accessdate=27 September 2014|last=Kehr|first=David}}</ref> [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three stars out of five in ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', noting that "As a film, it is at once too much a part of an overarching story and divided into too many episodes to be all of a piece. However, as a sustained collection of scare moments, it's a winner."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=10270|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140927234541/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=10270|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 September 2014|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|title=Ju-On: The Grudge|accessdate=27 September 2014|author=Newman, Kim}}</ref> Derek Elley compared the film unfavorably to both ''The Ring'' and ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', writing that "In the end, “The Grudge” comes down to little more than when and where the ghostly little boy will next appear, and the final explanation is so-what."<ref name="variety-review" />
