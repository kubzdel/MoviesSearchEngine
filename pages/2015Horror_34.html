'''''Bullets, Fangs and Dinner at 8''''' is a 2015 American [[horror film]] written and directed by '''Matthew Rocca'''. The film has been considered a hybrid of the [[vampire]] horror subgenre and the modern [[Crime film|crime]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] genre, with undertones of dark comedy. It was inspired by films such as ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' and ''[[The Departed]]''. 

== Plot ==
A cult of humans thirsty for blood are behind a mass killing at a church. The church's pastor, Steven Cooper, secretly masterminded the attack and is actually the leader of the "vampire" cult. Seminary student Michael Collins is the only one who knows the truth about Steven's duplicity, and seeks out proof to expose him with the help of a civilian he saves, Vivian Abbott. A dinner party to help endorse Steven's good name is just the distraction needed to investigate him. But as the night continues, both Michael and Steven are put in extreme situations while trying to stay steps ahead of the other.<ref name="Plot">{{cite web| url=http://malevolentmagazine.wordpress.com/category/fantastic-horror-film-festival/ | title = THE FINAL FIVE FILMS FOR THE FESTIVAL CHOSEN AS OFFICIAL SELECTION FOR FHFF’s 2015 SEASON| publisher=malevolentmagazine.wordpress.com}}</ref>

== Production ==
Before its release in 2015, Matthew Rocca spent four years writing the film between short student films at San Diego State University. Upon graduating, he went into pre-production in 2011 and started officially shooting the film in 2012. Because of its large cast of extras and small budget, principal photography took an additional two years to finally wrap in February 2014.  The film was shot in various locations in [[San Diego]] county including its opening scene at the Church of St. Luke's in Rancho San Diego, and various scenes at dk3 Studios in Mira Mesa.<ref name="dk3" />  Dave King, the dk3 president, was happy to provide his studio for Rocca to film critical shots.<ref name="dk3">{{cite web| url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bullets-fangs-and-dinner-at-8-feature-length-film-by-matthew-rocca-shooting-at-dk3-studios-llc-in-mira-mesa-october-21--22-228708811.html | title = Feature-length film by Matthew Rocca shooting at dk3 studios LLC |publisher= dk3 studios LLC| via = PRnewswire}}</ref>
