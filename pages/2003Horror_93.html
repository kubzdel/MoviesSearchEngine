==Plot==
The crew of the space shuttle ''Oklahoma'' comes back to Earth, one of its crew members having been struck in the arm by a tiny meteor, which evidently contains alien lifeforms. This alien life parasitizes its human hosts to evolve into rapidly proliferating insect-like creatures. The ''Oklahoma'''s chief medical officer (Lea) works to stop the spread of the infestation before it reaches the "threshold" population, at which humanity will be effectively unable to contain it and the alien life will take over.
