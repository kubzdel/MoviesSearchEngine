==Plot==
The plot revolves around two children who were injected with the original Tomie’s blood, and thus grew into full-fledged Tomies themselves. The process however was flawed causing them to degrade and forcing them to attempt to locate more blood from a "pure" Tomie to sustain themselves. 

Years later a young man who recently lost his girlfriend Naoko begins work in a factory, where he attracts the amorous attention of a mysterious woman who lurks behind the scenes. Due to his love for his deceased girlfriend and his inability to move on he does not feel any  particular attraction to the clone of Tomie. This of course intrigues her, and she begins to become obsessed with him. Soon, he is caught in a vicious struggle between two rival Tomies. And neither Tomie will die.
