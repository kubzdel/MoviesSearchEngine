{{nihongo|'''''Yoroi Samurai Zombie''''' AKA '''''Samurai Zombie'''''|鎧 サムライゾンビ|Yoroi: Samurai zonbi}} is a 2008 Japanese [[Comedy horror|comic horror film]] directed by [[Tak Sakaguchi]] and written by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], who had previously collaborated on ''[[Versus (2000 film)|Versus]]''.  A family taken hostage and their kidnappers become prey to an undead samurai in a haunted cemetery.

== Plot ==
A family of four (Shigeo, Yasuko, Asami and Ryota) on a road trip has their idyllic holiday turned into a nightmare with a bizarre series of events. They stop their car after accidentally hitting a man dressed in white (Aihara) but when he stands up brandishing a gun, another man, Jirō, shoots Aihara. Jirō and his manic girlfriend Lisa then hijack the family's car, holding the father at gun point. When one of the tires is punctured, Jirō tells the father, Shigeo, that they are in the land of the undead and that the father must go off to find help, leaving his family with the captors. When Shigeo finds a ghostly cemetery he starts digging until he finds a blade which he then uses to decapitate himself, with the resulting fountain of blood spraying an ancient tomb. Some time later an eerie samurai warrior appears from the tomb and begins to hunt the family and the captors. The fugitives think to find shelter in an abandoned building but more horrors and surprises await.
