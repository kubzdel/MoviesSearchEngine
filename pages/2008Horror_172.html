'''''Saw V''''' is a 2008 American-Canadian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/832823|title=BFI Film & TV Database – Saw V|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> [[horror film]] directed by [[David Hackl]] and written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]] and stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Scott Patterson (actor)|Scott Patterson]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Julie Benz]], [[Carlo Rota]], and [[Meagan Good]]. It is the fifth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]], and was released in North America on October 24, 2008.

David Hackl, who served as the production designer of ''[[Saw II]]'', ''[[Saw III]]'', and ''[[Saw IV]]'', and second-unit director for ''Saw III'' and ''Saw IV'' made his directorial debut with ''Saw V''.<ref>[http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 SAW V and SAW VI Director Already Signed!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205065713/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9373 |date=December 5, 2007 }}, [[Bloody Disgusting]]. Retrieved 2007 – December 4.</ref> Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, the writers of the previous film, returned to write the film. [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, also returned to compose the score for the film. ''Saw'' creators [[James Wan]] and [[Leigh Whannell]] served as executive producers.

The film focuses primarily on the events that led up to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] becoming an apprentice of the [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw Killer]], as well as his efforts to prevent anyone else from learning his secret.

==Plot==
Convicted murderer Seth Baxter wakes up chained to a table beneath a [[pendulum]] blade. A videotape informs him that he can release himself by crushing his hands between two presses. He does so, but the blade still swings down and cuts him in half as someone watches through a hole in the wall.

In [[Saw IV| the meatpacking plant]], FBI Agent Peter Strahm guns down Jeff Denlon and is locked in the sickroom. He discovers a hidden exit and a [[microcassette]] recorder, which urges him to stay in the sickroom, but he ignores it and is attacked in the tunnel by someone in a pig-mask. He wakes up with his head sealed in a box being filled with water, but survives by performing a [[tracheotomy]] with his pen. Outside, Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] delivers Corbett Denlon to the police and claims they are the only survivors, but is shocked when Strahm is brought out alive as well.

During a press conference, Hoffman is promoted to detective lieutenant and credited with closing the case. He finds a note in his office that reads "I know who you are" and learns of Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's phone. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were his name, and questions how he escaped the plant. Strahm is also visited by his boss, Dan Erickson, who puts him on medical leave. Now suspicious of Hoffman and determined to piece together his involvement with Jigsaw, Strahm takes case files of past victims and begins researching them on his own.

In an underground room, five people awaken with collars connected to mounted blades locked around their necks, the keys to which are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape claims that all five of them are connected and implores them to "do the opposite" of their instincts throughout the game. They are also told to solve the puzzles and leave the rooms before the timer runs out or the jars of explosives in each corner of the rooms will explode. Mallick, an arsonist, activates the timer and everyone must reach for their key, but the wires are connected to the other participants and so they must go one at a time. Everyone manages to reach their keys except for Ashley, a former fire inspector, who is decapitated when the collars retract. The four proceed to the next room, where they learn that the overhead jars contain keys to three bomb shelters. Charles, an investigative journalist, strikes Mallick and begins smashing the jars one by one. Brit, a real estate vice president, and Luba, a city planner, each find a key and Charles takes Mallick's, only to be struck by Luba and left to die when the bombs detonate. In the third room, five short cables must be connected to a full bathtub to unlock the door. They deduce that someone will have to stay in the bathtub while the other two escape so Luba attacks Mallick to use his body to close the circuits, but Brit stabs her and they manage to open the door. In the fourth room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five circular saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the door. Brit tries to use the keys from the first room to open the door but sees all the keys are the same, Mallick notes the five armholes and they realise that all five of them were meant to work together to survive the game. In the first room, they could have used the keys on each other to unlock the collars, in the second room the bomb shelters were big enough for more than one person and in the third room they all needed to hold the cables and put their hand in the water to open the door. Brit also works out their connection: they were all involved with a building fire that killed eight people. With no other options, they saw their arms to provide the blood.

Meanwhile, Strahm learns that Baxter killed Hoffman's sister, and was released from prison on a technicality. As revenge, Hoffman abducted and killed Baxter, using the pendulum trap to frame Jigsaw. It is revealed through flashbacks that he was later abducted by John Kramer, who blackmailed Hoffman into working with him. They set up most of the games together, with Hoffman planting Lawrence Gordon's penlight and providing the police files for the nerve gas house victims. Strahm realizes in the end that everyone was meant to die in the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman, who would appear to be a hero. His activities soon draw Erickson's worry, which is further fueled when Jill, who received a box and a videotape from Kramer's will, approaches Erickson and claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman calls Erickson to tell him about Strahm's theory of a second accomplice, Erickson puts a tracker on Strahm's phone.

Erickson follows the tracker to the observation room and finds the phone and his own personnel file, which were planted by Hoffman. He also finds Brit, who managed to crawl from the fourth room after Mallick passed out from blood loss. Erickson calls for medical attention for the victims, and puts out an [[all-points bulletin]] on Strahm, who follows Hoffman to the renovated nerve gas house, and finds an underground room containing a clear box filled with broken glass. Hoffman's tape urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman. After a brief struggle he seals Hoffman in the box, which seals the room's exit. Hoffman indicates the tape, which warns Strahm that if he does not enter the box he will die while Hoffman will inherit Jigsaw's legacy. The box is safely lowered into the floor as the walls close in on Strahm, who unsuccessfully attempts to escape through the ceiling grid, and is crushed to death.

===Critical reception===
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. The review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 13% of critics gave the film positive reviews, making it the second-poorest-reviewed film in the series, losing to the seventh film in the series, ''[[Saw 3D]]''. The Rotten Tomatoes consensus states "If its plot were as interesting as its torture devices, or its violence less painful than its performances, perhaps ''Saw V'' might not feel like it was running on fumes."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw_v/|title=Saw V Movie Reviews, Pictures – Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 20 out of 100, based on 13 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/sawv|title=Saw V (2008): Reviews|accessdate=2009-01-28|publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref>

Elizabeth Weizman of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' believed that the lack of Tobin Bell's [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw]] character hurt the film: "Bell's deliciously twisted madman was the lifeline of this series, and without him, we're left watching a routine horror flick that might as well have gone straight to DVD. The series began with two major assets that set it apart: the concept of a brilliantly righteous executioner, and the actor who played him. Now, aside from Bell's brief, intermittent cameos, it has neither. So where the original ''Saw'' was diabolical fun, this fifth installment is as bloodless as the most unfortunate of Jigsaw's victims."<ref name="New York Daily News">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/10/24/2008-10-24_saw_v_gore_fest_just_doesnt_cut_it_.html|title='Saw V' gore fest just doesn't cut it | location=New York | work=Daily News|first=Elizabeth|last=Weitzman|date=October 24, 2008}}</ref> Sam Adams of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "The virtues of the individual films are almost beside the point, since it's hard to imagine why anyone would want to pick up the thread at this late date, but ''Saw V'' is a particularly dull and discombobulated affair, shot and acted with all the flair of a basic-cable procedural".<ref name="LA Times">[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-saw25-2008oct25,0,112813.story 'Saw V' – Los Angeles Times]</ref>

Some reviews were positive, however. The British website [[Digital Spy]] rated it 3/5 stars and commended the film for its "solid acting, slick direction and suitably filthy cinematography too", while also stating it will "make far more sense to those familiar with the previous installments".<ref name= "DigitalSpy">[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/a133652/saw-v.html At The Movies – Saw V]</ref> [[IGN]] awarded the film with 3 out of 5 stars stating that the film ties up most of the loose ends of the previous 4 installments while also having a more straightforward and less complicated storyline. They also praised the traps for being the most inventive and best that the ''Saw'' franchise has had to offer.<ref name= "IGN">[http://movies.ign.com/articles/923/923545p1.html Saw V Review]</ref>

==Home media==
===Unrated Director's Cut===
During an interview at the 2008 Scream Awards, Hackl claimed that his [[director's cut]] of ''Saw V'' (released on [[DVD]] January 20, 2009<ref name=Saw5DVDDate>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialsawnews.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907010343/http://www.officialsawnews.com/ |archivedate=September 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>), would run approximately 14 minutes longer than the theatrical cut. Hackl also stated that a number of scenes in the film would be re-ordered and arranged differently than in the theatrical cut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/14010|title=Scream 08: 'Saw V' Director's Cut, What About 'Saw VII'?}}</ref> However, only a few changes were made and the extra footage was never released, running only four minutes longer than the theatrical version.

===Unrated Collector's Edition===
A collector's edition is available with exclusive packaging. It features sound effects, a collector's booklet, and a spinning "saw blade". The features on the [[DVD]] itself are the same as the standard Unrated Director's Cut.<ref name= "collectors">[https://www.amazon.com/dp/images/B001L9EXUM Unrated Collector's Edition Pic]</ref><ref name= "CE">[http://dvd.ign.com/objects/143/14308365.html Saw V (Unrated Collector's Edition)]</ref>
