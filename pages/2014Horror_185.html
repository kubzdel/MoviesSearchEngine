'''''TEN''''' is a 2014 thriller/horror film directed by [[Sophia Cacciola]] and [[Michael J. Epstein]]. The film had its world premiere on March 30, 2014 at the [[Boston Underground Film Festival]] and features an all-female ensemble cast. Michael Gingold of [[Fangoria]] described TEN as, "up to something a little different, looking to subvert audience expectations...and while TEN contains the scenario’s requisite blood and nudity, it veers off in directions you likely won’t see coming, both in narrative terms and in the way it explores questions of female identity.” <ref>{{cite web|title=TEN in Fangoria issue 335|url=http://blog.michaeljepstein.com/2014/08/ten-featured-in-fangoria-magazine-issue.html}}</ref> Lauren Shiro of [[Curve (magazine)]] wrote, “deeper still, the movie takes on a political and sociological stance, examining stereotypes, identity, and also the subtext and themes behind story lines.” <ref>{{cite web|title=No One Is Who They Seem. Not Even You: A Pig in Pandora’s Box|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Review/Film/No-One-Is-Who-They-Seem-Not-Even-You/}}</ref> Jed Gottlieb of the [[Boston Herald]] described TEN, “imagine Scream crossed with The Usual Suspects...The art comes with meticulously framed shots full of color, the enjoyment with puzzling out the crazy plot twists.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting Cheap Thrills from Indie Flick TEN|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/movie_news/2013/08/getting_cheap_thrills_from_indie_flick_ten}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
Ten women find themselves in a vacant mansion on Spektor Island in December, 1972. Each believes she's traveled to the house on business, but they all agree that something seems strange. For one thing, the entire house is full of pictures and statues of pigs.

The women all come from drastically different walks of life. None of them would have chosen to spend the night together in such an eerie place, but the last ferry for the mainland has just left, and a terrible storm is rolling in. Trying to make the best of an unpleasant situation, they raid the mansion's wine cellar and throw a party. As the night creeps on, however, it becomes clear that someone—or something—has arranged to get them in the house. It's not long before someone mentions that Spektor Island is supposed to be haunted. Of course, no one in the house believes in ghosts.
At least, not until the first murder.

What do an actress, a religious zealot, a renegade, a coed, a model, a singer, a medium, a real-estate investor, a historian, and a doctor have in common? None of them is who they seem. Yet, the fate of the entire world may rest in their hands.
