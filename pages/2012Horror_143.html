Tina's mother killed the woman who she suspects to be her husband's mistresses,chopping them up and feeding their corpses on the refrigerator,until the police saw her corpse in the refrigerator. the policeman/detective was blinded when he tried to open the refrigerator. They also consulted with the priest,giving them instructions to defeat the demon.
