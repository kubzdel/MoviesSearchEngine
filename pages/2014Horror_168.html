==Plot==
After the demise of the [[National Police Corps|Spanish Police]] [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEOs]] team sent in to deal with the situation in the second film, the fourth film opens with the [[Spanish Army|Army]] taking control and sending in a [[Grupo de Operaciones Especiales (Spain)|Special Forces Team]] to destroy the building. They begin setting bombs all over the apartments, but when they're ambushed by the infected Manu and the old man, they then kill them off and kill the officers infected as well. They then hear Ángela's screams for help one of the officers returns to rescue her. He meets her in the stairs and tells her it is time to get out.

Ángela wakes up in a room where Doctor Ginard is performing tests on her. He asks her if she remembers anything and she says no. Ginard takes a blood sample to make sure she's clean. A GEO, Guzman, finds an elderly lady, who is revealed to be the only survivor of the events that took place in ''[[REC 3: Genesis]]''. He meets up with his partner, Lucas. Ángela attempts to escape the lab, and runs into Guzman. Both discover they are on a boat. Doctor Ricarte and the soldiers tell them that the situation is under control as Ángela's blood returned clear of any infection.

Guzman is introduced to Captain Ortega, who's making his last voyage, and Nick, who's in charge of com-apps. Nick is trying to recover the footage from Ángela's camera. Later that night, a blackout occurs. Guzman finds Ángela walking in the hallways of the ship. She claims to have gotten scared and Guzman keeps her wandering a secret. The next afternoon, Ángela meets Nick, who's a huge fan of her. He shows her the tape and Ángela begins to remember [[Tristana Medeiros]]. Nick also sends the file to the labs for them to look over.

Ricarte and his team discover that their test subject, an infected monkey, was released during the blackout. The monkey attacks and infects the ship's cook. Their blood contaminates the ship's food supply, which infects most of the crew through ingestion. After unsuccessfully testing an antidote on the cook, they leave Ángela, Guzman, Lucas and the old woman in the cafeteria. It turns out Lucas took a sample of blood from the building and knows that the people in charge are the Vatican. After they arm themselves with knives and kill two infected men and a monkey, the old woman is separated and Lucas volunteers to find her while Guzman and Ángela go to the Captain and Nick for help.

Ricarte gives up with nothing left to do to stop the infection and then decides to pursue the "protocol." Just before doing so, his assistant informs him of receiving the uploaded footage. Ricarte witnesses Tristana inserting a worm-like parasite into Ángela. He attempts to extract the parasite by forcing surgery on Ángela, who pleads that she doesn't know what he's talking about, but before an incision can be made, the captain's assistant who is now infected breaks in and bites Ricarte's assistant which allows Ángela to escape. Ricarte and his team then go to search for Ángela but then seals himself away after the cook is released and attacks his team only to be attacked by Ángela, who bites him, telling him to scan his blood and see for himself that he is mistaken. Guzman, Lucas and Nick then try to find weapons and a way to restart the ship. Nick then tells them that Ángela is alive so Guzman goes to find her while Lucas and Nick head to the boiler room.  Ricarte proves Ángela's theory when his analysis returns negative. Still, Ricarte is convinced that Ángela is tricking them so Guzman asks Ángela if she is, but then she asks Guzman if he has been tricking them all along. It's revealed that Ángela passed the parasite into Guzman during her rescue. Ricarte then sets the ship to self-destruct and escapes while Guzman traps Ángela below.

Lucas is then killed by the infected in the boiler room and Nick finds Ricarte, who has a lifeboat. Nick asks for Ángela but Ricarte tells him she's as good as dead. Nick knocks him out, takes the lifeboat and searches for her. He later finds her, and both kill the infected monkeys with a boat-motor. They hide from the infected in the cafeteria and then are attacked by Guzman. The parasite possessing Guzman then attempts to reinstate itself into Ángela but she kills Guzman with a harpoon gun thanks to Nick. Ángela and Nick leave the boat as all the infected chase after them. Ángela jumps into the ocean and Nick follows, escaping as the ship explodes. Underwater, the Parasite, still alive, is devoured by a predatory fish.

During the credits, Ángela and Nick are shown in a cab, having made it home.

==Production==
On 3 May 2010, [[Bloody Disgusting]] announced that "...Filmax will produce two new ''[REC]'' films in the next couple of years called ''[REC] 3: Genesis'' and ''[REC] 4: Apocalypse'' with the same directors as the first two films".<ref name="Bloody Disgusting Sequel">{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20053 |title=''&#39;Rec&#39;'' Directors Return for Not One, But TWO Sequels!!! |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref> ''Genesis'' was released on 30 March 2012. It was directed by the Co-founder of the [[REC (film)|REC]] franchises, [[Jaume Balagueró]], who co-wrote the script along Manu Diez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/83358/rec-4-apocalypse-character-videos-off-quick-fix/|title=REC 4: Apocalypse Character Videos Offer a Quick Fix|work=Dread Central|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> [[Carlos Fernández (producer)|Carlos Fernández]], [[Julio Fernández (producer)|Julio Fernández]] and [[Alberto Marini]] returned 4th time as executive producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/90361/exclusive-reveal-uk-dvdblu-ray-trailer-rec-apocalypse/|title=Exclusive Reveal: UK DVD/Blu-ray Trailer for [REC] Apocalypse|work=Dread Central|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>

In an interview with ''Fangoria'', director Balagueró stated that the film would not have an apocalyptic style presumed by its title, stating, "All of the movies in the ''[REC]'' series have the same budget, so you’re not really going to see big scenes of Barcelona full of zombies; they’re just not intended that way. There has to be a story that’s controlled and strong." ''Apocalypse'' is set to follow the events of the second film, and will not be made in the "found footage" style. Production was scheduled to begin in 2013. At the 2012 Sitges Film Festival, it was announced the film would have its world premiere there in October 2013. An announcement trailer was released in late November, confirming the return of Manuela Velasco.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

However, in early May 2013, Balagueró stated that the film's production had been delayed and the film would now premiere sometime in mid-2014, but did confirm that Manuela Velasco would be starring in the fourth film. Teaser posters and an updated premise were released early May. Filming began on 13 July 2013 in [[Gran Canaria]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3242617/rec-4-apocalypse-started-filming-today/|title=[''REC 4''] ''Apocalypse'' Started Filming Today!!|accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> aboard a [[Russians|Russian]] merchant navy ship.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Behind The Scenes Of ''&#39;[REC] 4: Apocalypse&#39;'' With Manuela Velasco!  | date = 7 August 2013  | publisher = [[Bloody Disgusting]]  | url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3247571/behind-the-scenes-of-rec-4-apocalypse-with-manuela-velasco/  | accessdate = 10 August 2013}}</ref> A theatrical trailer for the film was released in April 2014.<ref>{{Cite web  | title = The Apocalypse Commences in a New Trailer for REC 4: Apocalypse  | date = 24 April 2014  | website = Beyond Hollywood  | url = http://www.beyondhollywood.com/the-apocalypse-commences-in-a-new-trailer-for-rec-4-apocalypse/  | accessdate = 5 May 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==
The film has received mostly mixed-to-positive reviews with some praising the return of Manuela Velasco and the dark tone of the original movies.
