==Plot==
Paul King ([[Anton Argirov]]) dies of [[kidney cancer]].  Five years later, his father Preston King ([[Jeffrey Combs]]), a scientist, invites the doctors that could not save his son to his uncharted island in the western Pacific. Paul's widowed wife Amelia Lockhart ([[Hunter Tylo]]), who believes Paul died five years ago from cancer, and Amelia's new boyfriend Tom Reed ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]), also travel to the island. There, King reveals that Paul never died and was saved from death by being injected with [[hammerhead shark]] DNA to modify his stem cells.  This turned Paul into a half-man/half-shark creature. King releases the water from the tank where he was keeping Paul, in hopes that he will eat the doctors as revenge for them firing him from his job five years previously. As Paul, now known as Hammerhead, chases after them, they escape along with Hammerhead.

Hammerhead begins killing the workers on the island and tracking down King's "guests" until he is eventually recaptured by King's remaining workers. King's men also capture Amelia, who King hopes his son will remember and mate with to create a half-human/half-shark offspring, as he is convinced that part of Paul is still human. King forces Amelia to watch as one of the doctors, Whitney Feder ([[Arthur Roberts (actor)|Arthur Roberts]]), is fed to Hammerhead. Amelia is then injected with a drug to calm her as King watches in hopes that Hammerhead will mate with her. However, instead of mating with Amelia, Hammerhead bites off his father's right arm. Tom Reed arrives at the laboratory and rescues Amelia. He forces liquid nitrogen down Hammerhead's throat, causing him to explode. As Amelia and Tom escape, King attempts to shoot Amelia, but Tom shoots him dead. The building explodes as Amelia and Tom, the only two survivors, escape.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
Jon Condit from ''[[Dread Central]]'' awarded the film a negative score of 2/5. In his review, Condit wrote, "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy has most of the usual problems movies of this type have – clichéd plot, subplots, supporting characters, and minor details that are introduced but never really followed through on, dull protagonists, illogical science, a monster that somehow manages to always be at just the right place at the right time, inconsistent special effects, etc. All of this would be easier to overlook if the movie gave us the killer landshark action we’re watching the movie for. We do get it but only in quick bursts that fail to fully satisfy."<ref name="condit05">{{cite web|last1=Condit|first1=Jon|title=Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy (2005) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/3753/hammerhead-shark-frenzy-2005/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=Jon Condit|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref> ''Popcorn Pictures.com'' awarded the film a score of 4/10, writing, "''Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy'' is a mixed bag. You have a preposterously-plotted but perfectly watchable B-movie which, sadly, is let down by a number of clichés and a sense of being too self-conscious to embrace its ridiculousness and go all-out. Not enough of the titular character hurts matters greatly too."<ref name="popcornpictures">{{cite web|title=Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy (2005)|url=http://www.popcornpictures.co.uk/hammerhead-shark-frenzy-2005/|website=Popcorn Pictures.com|publisher=Popcorn Pictures|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> ''Horror.net'' awarded the film a mixed 5 out of 10 stars, calling it "A good, goofy B-monster movie."<ref name="horrorrev">{{cite web|title=ammerhead: Shark Frenzy 2005 - Horror Movie Reviews from Buried.com - Horror.net :: The Web's Deadliest Horror Network|url=http://www.horror.net/moviereviews/hammerhead-shark-frenzy-2005/1849/|website=Horror.net|publisher=The Gravedigger|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref> Christopher Armstead from ''Film Critics United'' gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's acting, and the title monster's lack of screen time.<ref name="armsteadrev">{{cite web|last1=Armstead|first1=Christopher|title=Hammerhead|url=http://filmcriticsunited.com/hammerhead.html|website=Film Critics United.com|publisher=Christopher Armstead|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref>
