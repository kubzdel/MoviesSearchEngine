'''''Final Destination 5''''' is a 2011 American [[3D film|3D]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Steven Quale]] and is the fifth installment of the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. It was written by [[Eric Heisserer]] and stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]] and [[Tony Todd]].

Despite [[The Final Destination|the previous film]] being originally announced as the final of the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011, which includes deleted scenes, documentaries and a parody music video by the cast.

The film received mostly positive reviews; the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is currently the second-highest grossing film in the franchise.

==Plot==
[[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Sam Lawton|Sam Lawton]] is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a [[premonition]] that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it, except for his ex-girlfriend [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Molly Harper|Molly Harper]], who he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly; his friends [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Nathan Sears|Nathan Sears]] and [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Peter Friedkin|Peter Friedkin]]; Peter's girlfriend [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Candice Hooper|Candice Hooper]]; his boss [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Dennis Lapman|Dennis Lapman]]; and co-workers [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Olivia Castle|Olivia Castle]] and [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Isaac Palmer|Isaac Palmer]]. FBI agent [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Jim Block|Jim Block]] doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner [[William Bludworth]] mysteriously tells the survivors that "[[Death]] doesn't like to be cheated," and warns them to be careful. Believing this to be nonsense, they ignore his warning and leave.

Later, Candice goes to [[gymnastics]] practice with Peter, where an unseen entity begins to follow her, and when a chain reaction causes Candice to fly off the [[uneven bars]], she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed when his head is crushed by a falling [[Buddha]] statue during an [[acupuncture|acupuncture session]] at a Chinese spa. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the eye doctor is out looking for files the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge; and realize that Nathan is next on Death's list.

Meanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, [[List of characters in the Final Destination series#Roy Carson|Roy Carson]], during an argument by pushing him in front of a [[lifting hook]], which impales him through the chin. Nathan relays this information to the remaining survivors, who realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a [[wrench]] launched by a [[belt sander]] hits him in the face, killing him.

That evening, Sam works at a restaurant, and after work asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date to tell them that he has decided to kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the restaurant's kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside, but when he enters the restaurant he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is now safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. Sam and Peter fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious, but just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer; leading Sam to believe he has claimed Block's life.

Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a flight to [[Paris]]. As they take their seats, a fight breaks out between two passengers ([[List of Final Destination characters#Alex Browning|Alex Browning]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Carter Horton|Carter Horton]]), revealing the plane he and Molly are on is [[Final Destination (film)|Flight 180]]. Upon take-off, Sam overhears that one of the passengers had a vision of the plane's destruction, but it is too late for them to leave and both he and Molly are killed before the plane explodes. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a brain [[aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was presumed to die "any day now." As Nathan realizes he may still be in danger, the landing gear from Flight 180 crashes through the roof and crushes him, setting off the events of [[Final Destination|the first four films]].

===Writing===
According to Heisserer, ''Final Destination 5'' was always meant to be a [[prequel]], set before the first film; the idea having come from franchise producer Craig Perry. Heisserer said that one major problem he encountered while writing the film was coming up with good death sequences, believing that managing to do so in the world of ''Final Destination'' is "ridiculously hard". The inspiration for Olivia's death sequence involving [[LASIK]] [[eye surgery]] after his wife underwent the same type of surgery.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Trace|title=Taking the Blame: An Interview With Screenwriter Eric Heisserer!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3397692/eric-heisserer-interview/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=20 July 2016}}</ref>

Before the film appeared in theaters, Fisher released a music video. Starring the main cast of ''Final Destination 5'' and featuring Fisher's original song "New Romance", the video parodied the 1990s sitcom ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' and included a clue to the plot of the film. Fisher, a fan of the show, and video director Dave Green watched every episode, and contemporary shows like ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' and ''[[Clarissa Explains It All]]''. "We thought, 'Gosh wouldn’t it be fun and subversive to have Final Destination-type deaths in this safe, [sitcom] world?’" Fisher, who plays a [[Zack Morris]]-like character, said. He joked, "I basically have always been looking for a way to dance with [[List of Saved by the Bell characters#Kelly Kapowski|Kelly Kapowski]] my whole life".<ref name="semigran20110810">{{cite news | url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/08/10/final-destination-5-star-miles-fisher/ | title='Final Destination 5' star Miles Fisher talks viral 'Saved by the Bell' spoof | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=2011-08-10 | accessdate=12 April 2014 | author=Semigran, Aly}}</ref>

The visual effects were praised for improving on the weak [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] from the previous installment.

===Controversy===
The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in the UK ruled that the original theatrical poster, which had been used on buses and trains during the summer, "was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children". It ruled that the advert must not appear in the original form again.

Warner Bros. countered by stating that the poster "accurately reflected the content of the film in an appropriate manner without causing excessive fear or distress". They also added that the poster's dark grey and black colours were "unlikely to engage the attention of young children", and that the "surreal" image did not feature people, blood or display any real life violence.

The ASA, which had received 13 complaints, with three stating that their children (aged between 1 and 3) had been upset, ruled "We considered the image was likely to catch the attention of children, especially because it was shown on a poster on the Underground, where it was an untargeted medium. Because very young children might view this ad depicting violence, it was likely to cause fear and undue distress to children."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16065584 | work=BBC News | title=Final Destination 5 poster banned by ASA | date=2011-12-07}}</ref>
