'''''Curse of Chucky''''' is a 2013 American [[supernatural]] [[slasher film]] and the sixth installment of the [[Child's Play (franchise)|''Child's Play'' franchise]]. The film was written and directed by [[Don Mancini]], who created the franchise and wrote all films to date. It stars [[Brad Dourif]] as [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] and [[Fiona Dourif]] as [[Nica Pierce]], as well as [[Danielle Bisutti]], [[A Martinez]] and [[Brennan Elliott]]. The film grossed $3.4 million in DVD sales.

The film sees the return to the franchise's source material and bringing back the straightforward [[Horror film|horror]] elements found in the first three ''Child's Play'' films as well as Chucky's classic appearance. The film, which went into production in September 2012, is the first direct-to-video installment of the series. ''Curse of Chucky'' is the first film to be distributed by [[Universal Studios]] since ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'', and debuted via [[Video on demand|VOD]], September 24, 2013. This was followed by a DVD and Blu-ray Disc release, October 8, 2013, in the United States. The film was also turned into a scare zone for 2013's annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]] at Universal Studios Hollywood. Though the film was made with the intention of being released direct-to-video, it also was released theatrically in some countries as Mexico and Brazil. The film was followed by ''[[Cult of Chucky]]'' in 2017.

==Plot==
[[Seed of Chucky|Nine years after the events of ''Seed of Chucky'']], [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]) mysteriously arrives in the mail at the home of [[paraplegic]] [[Nica Pierce]] ([[Fiona Dourif]]) and her mother Sarah ([[Chantal Quesnel]]). Later that night, Sarah is found dead from a stab wound, and her death is ruled as a [[suicide]]. Later, Nica is visited by her domineering older sister Barb ([[Danielle Bisutti]]), accompanied by her husband Ian ([[Brennan Elliott]]), their six-year-old daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell), and Father Frank ([[A Martinez]]). Alice finds Chucky and is allowed to keep him. 

Later that evening, while Alice and Nica are making soup, Chucky secretly pours rat poison into one of the dinner bowls. Father Frank eats the poison and, after leaving the house, is [[decapitation|decapitated]] in a car accident. That night, Nica investigates Chucky on the Internet and finds news articles about the murders tied to both the doll and Charles Lee Ray. Elsewhere, Chucky kicks a bucket of rainwater onto the floor's power outlets, electrocuting Jill and causing a [[Power outage|blackout]]. Barb gets up to check on Alice and is attacked by Chucky, who stabs her in the eye with a kitchen knife. Nica hears Barb's cries but has to crawl up the stairs. Once upstairs, Nica discovers that Barb is dead and Chucky is alive. When Chucky flees, Nica wakes Ian up in a panic. 

Ian takes Nica to the garage but is unable to find Alice. He disarms Nica, believing her to be responsible for the murders. Nica tries to explain that Chucky is alive, but Chucky acts like a lifeless doll when Ian looks at him. Ian decides to review the footage from a hidden camera that he planted on Chucky earlier (to get evidence of Barb's affair with Jill) and learns that Alice is locked in a closet and that Chucky truly is alive. Exposed, Chucky kills Ian by chopping off his lower jaw with a [[hatchet]] before he can act. Nica manages to break out of her restraints and avoids an axe to the chest by blocking it with her numb legs. The axe gets stuck, allowing Nica to stun Chucky into dropping the axe, and she pulls it out of her legs and beheads him. Chucky reattaches his head as her attention lapses, and pushes her over a balcony onto the ground floor.

When Nica asks why Chucky is doing this, he explains through [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that as Charles Lee Ray, he was a friend of her family and in love with Sarah. Ray killed Nica's father and kidnapped Sarah while she was pregnant with Nica. When Sarah betrayed him, he stabbed her in the stomach (which resulted in Nica being born paraplegic) and escaped. Ray's flight from the police ultimately led to [[Child's Play (1988 film)|his death as a human]], which is why he came back to Sarah for revenge. Nica manages to retreat into her elevator and disarm Chucky and plunge the dagger into his torso. Officer Stanton (Adam Hurtig) arrives at the house but sees Nica holding the bloody knife after finding Barb's body. A motionless Chucky watches from a nearby chair.

Sometime later, Nica is sent to a mental asylum for the criminally insane. Chucky is retained by the police as an exhibit for her trial. The arresting officer gets in his car and sees Chucky breathing in the bag. Just before he opens the bag, [[Tiffany Valentine|Tiffany]], who had been hiding in the backseat and returned in her human form, slits his throat with a nail file, killing him. Tiffany collects Chucky and asks, "Who's next?" before closing the bag.

Meanwhile, Alice, now living with her grandmother, comes home from school to find Chucky waiting for her. Chucky persuades Alice to play "Hide The Soul", and starts the infamous [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] chant to transfer his soul into Alice's body. The grandmother, who Chucky has attacked but did not kill, sits up suddenly, suffocating in a plastic bag, shortly after Chucky begins the chant.

In a [[post-credits scene]] set six months later, Chucky, still in his doll body, is delivered to the now-adult [[Andy Barclay]] ([[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]]). When Andy turns his back to answer a phone call from his mother, Chucky cuts his way out of the package with a knife. "Play with this" was all Andy had said to Chucky before shooting him in the head, [[Cult of Chucky|which leads to the events of the seventh film]].

==Production==
In an August 2008 interview, [[Don Mancini]] and [[David Kirschner]] spoke of a planned [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Chucky (franchise)|''Chucky'' franchise]] to be written and directed by Mancini. They described their choice of a [[remake]] over a sequel as a response to the will of the fans, who "want to see a scary Chucky movie again", and "want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy." They indicated that [[Brad Dourif]] would return as the voice of Chucky.<ref name="AICN">{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/37997|title= Quint chats up Don Mancini, David Kirschner and Michelle Gold about the CHILD'S PLAY REMAKE and the new DVD!!!|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=August 19, 2008|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

In a subsequent interview, Mancini described the [[remake]] as a darker and scarier retelling of the [[Child's Play (1988 film)|original movie]], but one that, while having new twists and turns, will not stray too far from the original concept.<ref name="STYD">{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=7637|title=''Child's Play''Mancini&Kirschner|date=September 8, 2008|work=ShockTillYouDrop.com|publisher=CraveOnline Media|accessdate=October 11, 2009}}</ref> At a 2009 horror convention, Brad Dourif confirmed his role in the remake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/mgm-rolling-childs-play-remake/|title=MGM Gets Rolling On A ‘Child’s Play’ Remake|date=25 March 2011|accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref> At a reunion panel at the Mad Monster Party horror and sci-fi convention, the cast and crew from the original film confirmed both a remake and a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] are in development.

In June 2012, it was confirmed that a sequel would enter production, entitled ''Curse of Chucky'' and be released [[direct-to-video]].

===Filming===
The film began production in early September 2012 in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada and ended in mid-October. In November 2012, Don Mancini announced that filming for ''Curse of Chucky'' had been completed and he planned to release it Halloween 2013.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

==Release and marketing==
In May 2013, [[Fiona Dourif]] released the first image of Chucky through her [[Instagram]]. The image is from the film's soundtrack cover and shows Chucky looking more like the doll from the first three films rather than the previous two films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/first-look-at-chucky-in-curse-of-chucky|title=First Look at Chucky in Curse of Chucky!|publisher=[[MovieWeb]] |last=Orange |first=B.

==Reception==
The film holds an 83% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 18 reviews.<ref name="rottentomatoes.com">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/curse_of_chucky/</ref> An early review posted on ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' on August 2, 2013, was very favorable of the film. Brad Miska stated, "''Curse of Chucky'' may just be the best home video sequel since ''Wrong Turn 2''. It's alarmingly good, which puts pressure on Universal to answer as to why they didn't let Mancini shoot this for theaters". He continued to say, "Chucky fans should rejoice, though, as ''Curse of Chucky'' is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come."<ref>http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3246893/fantasia-13-review-curse-of-chucky-brings-the-old-school-wrath-of-childs-play/</ref> Ryan Larson of [[Shock Till You Drop]] also had mostly positive things to say about it, stating that "the movie does so much right that it’s easy to overlook the very few flaws it has. The pacing and writing coincide to create a fun blood-soaked jaunt that never gets boring or dull." He goes on to praise the director, pointing out that "Mancini (pulling double duty as writer as well as director) does a great job at introducing and ushering off characters in a fashion that doesn’t bog the film down with a bunch of characters who get three minutes of film time before getting the axe, or butcher knife in this case. The kills are kitschy, but in the best way possible, waxing nostalgic of the slasher films of the late eighties and early nineties."<ref>http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/reviews/176329-review-curse-of-chucky/</ref>

At the film's world premiere at the [[Montreal]] [[Fantasia Festival]], it received a Gold Award for Best International Feature.<ref>fantasia-13-curse-of-chucky-wins-audience-award-big-bad-wolves-for-best-film</ref>
