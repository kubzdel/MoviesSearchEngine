Marc Savlov from ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' awarded the film three out of a possible five stars, stating "Far better (and, freakishly, more subtle) at recalling the tone and spirit of Eighties teen moviegoing than the faux-dopey slapstick of Hot Tub Time Machine, Bologna's homage to exsanguinations past is a bloody good updating of past arterial spurters."<ref name="austinchronicle">{{cite web|last1=Savlov|first1=Marc|title=The Black Waters of Echo's Pond - Film Calendar - The Austin Chronicle|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/calendar/film/2010-04-09/the-black-waters-of-echos-pond/|website=Austin Chronicle.com|publisher=Marc Savlov|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>
Dennis Harvey from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review writing, "Silly, scareless ''The Black Waters of Echo’s Pond'' finds yet another group of disposable youths unleashing yet another ancient evil something or other, to their inevitable detriment. Though this generic horror meller would be most at home debuting on Syfy — perhaps double-billed with ''Pinata: Survival Island''".<ref name="Varietyreview">{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|title=The Black Waters of Echo’s Pond – Variety|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/reviews/the-black-waters-of-echo-s-pond-1117942553/|website=Variety.com|publisher=Dennis Harvey|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>
