==Plot synopsis==
Charles runs a website that reviews "the more macabre of the cinema world" and he has stayed up a bit too late trying to catch up on his work ala a horror movie marathon. In his rapid absorption of an endless series of dark delicacies, Charles has emerged the next day, the first day of Summer School in a bit of a mental flux. He is slipping in and out of consciousness, into a realm of sadistic, genre bending nightmares that test his sanity and question his grip on reality.<ref name="RCF Synopsis">{{cite web | title = Summer School Synopsis | publisher = Summer School Synopsis| accessdate = 2009-02-02 | url = http://www.randomcreatureface.com/summerschool/synopsis}}</ref>

==Police incident==
In August 2005, St. Paul, Minnesota police were called to a local neighborhood with to investigate a possible shooting. The car contained “blood” and “brain matter” on the seats, dashboard, and windows. After canvassing the area, the officers discovered the owner of the car, Lance Hendrickson, one of the directors. The blood and bits of brain were fake—the officers were shown the scene from the then in-production film as proof.
