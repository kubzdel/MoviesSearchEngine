{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
One of [[Africa]]'s most shocking legends comes to life in this terrifying tale of four students whose fascination with tales of a [[Wereleopard|half-human, half-leopard man-beast]] find them fighting for their lives. The tales have been passed down through the generations, but few have lived to see the horrific monstrosity firsthand and lived to tell the tale. Now, as four students venture into the wilderness under the flawed theory of safety in numbers, the best will make itself known, and the curious students will find out why some legends are best left to the storytellers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Half Caste - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/half_caste/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes.com|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>
