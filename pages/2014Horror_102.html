A sequel, ''[[The Houses October Built 2]]'', also directed by Roe and reprising some of the original cast, was released in September 2017.

==Plot==
The film begins ''[[in medias res]]'' to a dazed and bloodied Brandy (Schaefer) being put in a truck and driven off. Days earlier, a group of friends from [[Ohio]] -- Brandy, her boyfriend Zack (Andrews), cameraman Jeff (Larson), Bobby (Roe), and Mikey (Roe) -- decide to take a trip south to visit some of America's scariest and extreme [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted house attractions]] in the days leading up to [[Halloween]]. They plan to record their experiences in the haunted houses as well as interview actors who work there. This leads to disturbing revelations about the establishments' operations, such as failure to perform background checks, utilizing criminals and disturbed individuals as actors, using real corpses and body parts as props, and performing increasingly dangerous stunts for the sake of scares.

The group begins with well-known haunted houses at first, though their main goal is to locate an extreme haunt called "Blue Skeleton," a mysterious group that moves to a different, secret location every year and is said to employ real [[torture]] to elicit scares. Zack in particular is determined to find Blue Skeleton, growing increasingly agitated with what he views as pedestrian scares of well-known haunts. The group also antagonizes haunted house staff by filming and being disruptive, but the staff's animosity grows sinister when they are followed to a different site by a clown from an earlier house, as well as a young actress from the same house appearing outside their [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] despite the group having traveled over a hundred miles.

Bobby, Zack, and Brandy are later confronted by a staff member from another house accusing them of filming inside a prohibited establishment, although they had turned their cameras off; Jeff, going to the woods to urinate, is chased by a man dressed in a bunny costume brandishing an axe, though the man turns out to be an actor. Zack also meets other guests who inform him that they experienced Blue Skeleton, and that it is in [[Louisiana]] this year; they also tell him of a bar where they can find a man who can take them there. Later that night, an actor breaks into their van and films the group while they sleep, stroking Brandy's face. Bobby finds the video uploaded to haunted house forums, but Zack tells him to keep it a secret, as he does not want the rest of the group getting cold feet. A cow heart is also left inside their refrigerator. Brandy and Bobby grow reluctant to continue, but Zack insists they keep going.

At the bar, the group finds themselves surrounded by actors, and they are confronted about filming again. While Brandy is in the bathroom, the rest of the group goes outside to meet with the connection to Blue Skeleton. Meanwhile, two male actors take the abandoned camera and film themselves cornering Brandy in the bathroom, seriously unnerving her; but she manages to escape the bathroom. She tells the rest of the group what happened. They confront the two and reclaim the camera. Zack reassures her and the rest of the group that Blue Skeleton was what they had been waiting for. While preparing for bed, the group finds the RV surrounded by dozens of actors; one of them, walking on top of the RV, cuts the lights. After getting the lights back on, they find the actors gone. The next morning, they find a [[pumpkin]] outside of the RV with skeleton masks and instructions on how to meet with their next connection to Blue Skeleton.

The group arrives at the rendezvous point at a Halloween festival and look for another actor wearing the same mask. Though they spot one, they are ignored. In the commotion, Jeff is lured to an alley by an actor dressed as Mikey. He finds himself cornered by the clown, the young actress, and the actor in the bunny suit. Jeff is stabbed and has his tongue cut out while his phone is taken away. The rest of the group tries to call him, but only get a message telling them of another meetup location. Despite Brandy and Bobby's pleas, Zack drives there. They are approached by a bus and receive a text telling them to leave the RV or else Jeff will be killed. Zack complies, while the rest of the group is dragged out by attackers lurking in the RV. They are hooded and bound before being driven off in the bus. While the rest of the group panics, Zack insists it is still part of the Blue Skeleton experience.

The men are dragged out at one location, while Brandy is driven to a second location. She is given a camera and told to film everything she sees. The group members wander through their respective rooms. Zack, in a darkened room armed with nothing but a [[glowstick]], is bludgeoned by an actor. The rest of the group are terrorized before being driven to a remote area and buried alive in coffins by the Blue Skeleton members.
