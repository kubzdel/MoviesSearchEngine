'''''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale''''' is a 2010 Finnish [[dark fantasy]] [[Horror film|horror]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[Jalmari Helander]] about people living near the [[Korvatunturi|Korvatunturi mountain]] who discover the secret behind [[Santa Claus]]. The film is based on the 2003 [[short film]] ''Rare Exports Inc.'', and its 2005 sequel ''Rare Exports: The Official Safety Instructions'', by Jalmari Helander and Juuso Helander, both of which involve a company that traps wild Santa Clauses and trains and exports them to locations around the world.

==Plot==

A British research team from Subzero is taking drill core samples on top of [[Korvatunturi]] (Ear Fell) in the Finnish province of [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. The fell is believed to be the home of [[Joulupukki]], a figure in Finnish folklore that helped shape modern day versions of Santa Claus.

It becomes clear to team leader Riley that the entire [[fell]] is an ancient burial mound built by the [[Saami people|Saami]] over centuries to conceal and imprison something. Two local boys, Juuso and Pietari, watch the team at work and eavesdrop on their discussions. They run to Juuso's nearby snowmobile quarreling about Santa Claus's existence, as the team begins to excavate the fell using explosives. Pietari returns home to read some books about Santa Claus, which suggest that he was a horned being who whips misbehaving children and boils them in a cauldron.

The day before Christmas Eve, Pietari's father Rauno, a local reindeer slaughterer, digs a trap pit in the yard to protect the remaining reindeer in case of wolves. He wakes Pietari up by throwing a snowball at his window and tells him to prepare for rounding up reindeer herds with the other herders at the electric reindeer pen. This year, there were only two skinny reindeer runts, so Rauno and the herders go to a glacier by Korvantunturi. When they reach there they find the remains of hundreds of reindeer that were gnawed to the bone. It looks like the explosions that have been going on at the fell for months have driven the wolves in the area mad. Rauno, examines the carcasses worriedly. Farther away Pietari too examines the traces and is convinced that it's not the work of wolves, while Juuso warns him not to tell his father that they plied open the fence to Korvantunturi.

Rauno's reindeer slaughterhouse has been on the brink of bankruptcy for a long time. The attack of the wolves seems to be the final straw. But Rauno has one more chance. He heads to Korvatunturi to demand retribution from the Subzero company, whose personnel were killed for provoking a mysterious new threat by their rude behaviour. On the top of the fell all Rauno and his group find is a pit 400 meters deep and no trace of the Subzero personnel. It looks as if something was lifted from the depths of hell. Having lost all hope Rauno returns to his farm.

On the morning of Christmas Eve the trap has worked, but there is no wolf trapped in it. Even though Pietari was grounded for playing a trick with his father for using reindeer traps in the fireplace, he has been full of fear of the approaching Christmas, like an animal sensing a more powerful beast in its territory. He sneaks out of his father's house to a police truck, with his disappointed father in hot pursuit. They reach a village, where Rauno hears from other villagers that potato sacks, heaters, and Piiparinen's wife's hair-dryer, have gone missing. Pietari enters Piiparinen's house, and finds that Piiparinen's son Juuso is also gone, with a straw effigy in his place.

Piiparinen brings a sack, which contains a skinny old man, and leaves his inactive body on a table in Rauno's reindeer slaughterhouse. While he, Rauno, and Aimo discuss their plans, Pietari calls his friends on the telephone, and finds that they have all gone missing. Piiparinen teases the old man with a piece of gingerbread, and the old man bites off his ear. Piiparinen comes out and asks the other two men to come and see the old man. Pietari asks his father to spank him for his bad deeds, such as plying open the fence to Korvantunturi, as he fears that the children's bad deeds might have caused Santa to take them away. They are interrupted when Piiparinen tells Rauno to come and see the old man again, as the old man is strong enough to break a metal bar. When Pietari enters, the old man notices him, as the other men try to defend Pietari from being harmed.

They dress the old man in Piiparinen's Santa costume, and message the Americans that they "have found Santa Claus". They take the old man in a cage to an airbase, where they meet Riley. Riley warns that the old man in a cage is not Santa Claus, but one of Santa's elves, and that they must not behave rudely. When one of them mutters a curse word, the other elves (who look like naked old men) destroy the electric lights, and kill Riley and his pilot. The men and Pietari run to Hangar 24, where they find a horned being in an enormous block of ice being melted by the missing heaters. Underneath the block of ice are several sacks containing the crying stolen children, including Juuso. They are attacked by the elves, who attempt to break into the hangar.

As Rauno, Piiparinen, and Aimo disconnect the heaters and use them to block the elves from the doorway, Pietari devises a plan. Piiparinen comes out of the hangar, and distracts the elves by throwing gingerbread at them, so that he can reach the helicopter. The other two men make a net, which Pietari climbs on as it picks up the sacks of children to lure the elves to the reindeer pen. The other two men place explosives all over Santa Claus' ice block, and cut off his horns, before fleeing the hangar in a truck. Pietari climbs down the net of children and an antenna to open the reindeer pen, as the horde of elves runs toward him. Rauno and Aimo detonate the explosives, killing Santa Claus and causing the elves to stop at the reindeer pen before they can hurt Pietari.

After the children are returned to their homes, Rauno decides to start a new business with the Subzero company, in which the captured elves are trained to become mall Santas and exported to various locations around the world.

The film received positive criticism.

[[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film three and a half out of four stars and called it "a rather brilliant [[Coal#Cultural usage|lump of coal for your stocking]]" and considered it "an R-rated Santa Claus [[origin story]] crossed with ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''." He continued, "Apart from the inescapable [fact] that the movie has Santa and reindeer in it, this is a superior horror film, a spot-on parody of movies about dead beings brought back to life. Oh, and all the reindeer are dead." Ebert concluded that "this is a fine film. An original, daring, carefully crafted film, that never for one instant winks at us that it's a parody. In its tone, acting, location work, music and inexorably mounting suspense, this is an exemplary horror film, apart from the detail that they're not usually subtitled ''A Christmas Tale'' and tell about terrifying wild Santas."<ref>{{cite web |author= Ebert, Roger | authorlink =Roger Ebert | title= Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101222/REVIEWS/101229991 | date=22 December 2010 | accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>

Novelist and critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars ("Excellent") and praised its "very black humour and a strange mix of revisionist mythology, gruesome horror and authentic Christmas spirit. It has a gritty, outdoorsy feel appropriate to an exploration of the brutal side of a harsh, all-male life in an extreme climate ... Helander also shows suspense chops in vintage [[John Carpenter]] mode – the scenes with the captured Santa, a grinning creature waiting for a chance to kill, are good, straight horror stuff, and there's an effective climactic siege of bearded monsters."<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=136993 |last= Newman |first= Kim |authorlink= Kim Newman |title= ''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale'': You better watch out, you better not cry |journal= [[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |location= United Kingdom |publisher= www.empireonline.com |volume=  |issue=  |date=  |page= |accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref>

Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' describes the movie as "a fiendishly entertaining Christmas yarn rooted in Northern European legend and lore, complete with a not-so-jolly old St. Nick informed more by the [[Brothers Grimm]] than [[Norman Rockwell]]. While the richly atmospheric package has been wrapped with a healthy dose of wry satire, it's not of the mean-spirited ''[[Bad Santa]]'' variety. Helander, a successful commercial director in his native [[Helsinki]], shrewdly blends just the right amounts of fairy tale wonder and action movie heroics into the oddball mix to highly satisfying effect."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/rare-exports-christmas-tale-film-58843 |author= Rechtshaffen, Michael |date= December 10, 2010 |title= ''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale'' -- Film Review |publisher= ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' |accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref>

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the movie "a thing of frigid beauty and twisted playfulness ... Kids will love the diminutive, motherless hero and a plot that's completely bonkers; adults will enjoy the exuberantly pagan images and deadpan humor." It was rated a ''New York Times'' Critics' Pick.<ref>{{cite news |author= Catsoulis, Jeannette |title= Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010) - Discovering a Sinister Santa in Finland |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= December 2, 2010 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/movies/03rare.html?ref=movies&_r=0 |accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref>

Sheri Linden of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the "twisted black humor in this frosty Finnish fantasy ... What unfolds is a dark comic thriller and action-hero send-up, a strange alloy of daredevil helicopter maneuvers and night of the living elves. Captured in atmospheric widescreen camerawork, the end-of-the-world frozen landscape (actually Norway) is spectacular and spooky."<ref>{{cite news |last= Linden |first= Sheri |title= Movie review: ''Rare Exports'' |work= [[The Los Angeles Times]] |date= December 9, 2010 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/09/entertainment/la-et-rare-exports-review |accessdate= December 1, 2014}}</ref>

Reviewer Annika Pham, writing for Cineuropa.org, described it as a "Tim Burton-esque version of Santa's story" and said, "The icy Lappish landscapes are beautifully captured by [director of photography] Mika Orasmaa and the feel of the large-scale adventure epic is wrapped up in sweeping musical orchestration. The scary elements (suggested more than shown) are sufficient to keep 13+ viewers on edge, but could have been further elaborated – along with the original concept – to make ''Rare Exports'' a timeless seasonal delight."<ref name= "AP" />

Collider.com's reviewer Dave Trumbore called the film "a darkly humored tale that fits perfectly in line with such anti-Christmas classics as ''[[Gremlins]]'' and ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''" and wrote, "The contemporary Nordic setting that's so fitting for horror movies these days (''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'', ''[[Dead Snow]]'') is a perfect backdrop for ''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale'', not only in mood but in mythology as well ... While ''Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale'' does not have the level of gore of ''Dead Snow'' or the emotional impact of ''Let the Right One In'' (although Pietari does earn his father's respect in the end), it's a uniquely entertaining tale that adds a bit of welcome darkness to the often saccharine times leading up to Christmas."<ref name= "DT" />
