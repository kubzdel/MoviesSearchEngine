== Plot ==
In India, American backpacker friends Gina, John, Stacey, Geraldine and Phil hike in the woods with their guide Brian. When Geraldine is bitten by a venomous spider, the group decides to seek an American doctor, Dr. Lecorpus, who lives with a tribe in the jungle. Dr. Lecorpus treats Geraldine with the help of his brother, who wears a cloth over his face due to being disfigured. While Gina, John and Phil return to the village in the civilization, Brian and Stacey stay with the natives. They decide to visit a temple in the forest while waiting for Geraldine to recover. However, the two get split up and Stacey is attacked by a mass of spiders, who swarm her and cover her in [[spider web | spider webs]].

Gina, John and Phil arrive back at the village and head to the local police station. They meet Sgt. Chadhri, who agrees to investigate the village. Chadhri enters the woods and sees Lecorpus and several of the natives standing near a helicopter. However, Chadhri is caught by Lecorpus's brother; they take his gun and force him to walk to the village. Chadhri decides to investigate the temple and is attacked by Lecorpus's brother, who chases him deep into the temple.

The other three become worried after Chadhri does not return and Phil walks to a bigger village while Gina and John return into the woods. They arrive back at the village and witness a strange ceremony. They see Stacey, still wrapped in spider webs, being injected with [[venom]] and carried off into the temple by Lecorpus's brother. Gina and John are attacked by natives, and rush to save Stacey. Gina finds Stacey and Lecorpus then appears and tells Gina that Stacey is just paralyzed and not dead. John and Gina run into the temple and get split up.

Meanwhile, Phil discovers a newspaper which suggests that Lecorpus illegally [[organ harvesting | harvested organs]]. Gina and John find Stacey's [[camcorder]] and then find Brian alive, but he dies shortly after. Gina and John meet up with Chadhri and try to find their way out of the caves. They come across an operation room, and discover that Lecorups, his brother and the natives are all in on a scheme to harvest traveler's organs. They inject their victim with the venom to prevent the organs from spoiling while being transported. Gina, John and Chadhri manage to free Stacey, and escape the operating room.

Gina, John, Stacey and Chadhri run through the various tunnels and are pursued by Lecorpus's brother and the natives. They start a fire in a tunnel and Lecorpus's brother gets caught in the fire. Gina, John, Stacey and Chadhri  use spider webs to climb across a massive chasm in order to escape. Chadhri goes first, followed by Stacey, and then Gina. However, Chadhri tells John to wait before climbing on the web because it cannot sustain all their weight. After Chadhri and Stacey make it to the other side, John attempts to get on, but the web snaps, leaving Gina hanging above the chasm and stranding John on the opposite side.

Gina swings to the side of the chasm and throws Lecorpus in when he tries to kill her; he is swarmed by spiders and killed. Gina and Stacey leave with Chadhri, who promises John that he will come back for him. The three escape the temple, but they are attacked by Lecorpus's brother. Before he can kill Chadhri, a group of police officers led by Phil appear and shoot him dead. Phil is reunited with Gina and Stacey, who tell him that Brian and Geraldine are dead. They also tell the police officers that John is still trapped inside, and he is then seen being attacked by spiders.

Some time later, Gina is seen back in the village. She is visited by Chadhri, whom she tells that Stacey is getting better. He tells her that while John has not been found, he and the other officers are working around the clock to find him. However, John is shown completely encased in spider webs before the film ends.

==Reception==
Jeff Swindol, of [[Monsters and Critics]] said that "the film is crap and that you get the impression that one or the other used the same screenplay and one was with spiders and the other with monkeys since the supporting players are all archetypes."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1371911.php/DVD_Review_In_The_Spider_s_Web |title=DVD Review: In The Spider’s Web |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |last=Swindol |first=Jeff |date=November 7, 2007 |work=Monsters and Critics |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003064143/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1371911.php/DVD_Review_In_The_Spider_s_Web |archivedate=October 3, 2012 |df= }}</ref> Alex Hanson, of Chud.com, said that it was a mistake that he watched the film, hoping to be at least a little entertained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chud.com/articles/articles/13447/1/DVD-REVIEW-IN-THE-SPIDER039S-WEB/Page1.html |title=DVD REVIEW: IN THE SPIDER'S WEB |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |last=Hansen |first=Alex |date=January 30, 2009 |work=Chud.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204105101/http://chud.com/articles/articles/13447/1/DVD-REVIEW-IN-THE-SPIDER039S-WEB/Page1.html |archivedate=December 4, 2008 |df= }}</ref> Scott Weinberg, of [[FEARnet]], said that the film is amazingly, stunningly bad in every possible respect—and is therefore frequently hilarious, and possibly worthy of a look the next time it pops up on the Sci-Fi Channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/reviews/b9831_in_spiders_web_2007.html |title=In The Spider's Web (2007) |accessdate=December 30, 2009 |last=Weinberg |first=Scott |date=November 26, 2007 |work=FEARnet }}</ref>
