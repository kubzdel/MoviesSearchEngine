'''''Altered Species''''', early knowned as '''''Rodentz''''', is a 2001 [[horror film]], about a scientist who has found a way to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] damaged tissue in the body.

==Plot==
A scientist, searching for a way to end cancer, creates a green substance. His assistant, Walter, gets rid of it by pouring it down the sink. Due to pipes in the basement having leaks, the substance falls in a spot where it is exposed to rats. When the scientist leaves, Walter invites friends over for a party. As the party continues, the rats, including a giant one, attack the party goers.

==Home video==
The film was released on DVD in 2011 by [[Artisan Entertainment]]. It was released as a cropped full screen video. A special feature on the DVD is a commentary. A ''DVD Talk'' review said of the commentary, "We are treated to long periods of silence punctuated by the occasional muffled laugh. When someone makes a comment, the rest of the people say things like "yeah" or "that's cool".

==Reception==
A review by Staci Layne Wilson in her book ''Animal Movies Guide'', said that "this ratty little fright-flick is cheesy at best". Rob Lineberger, writing for ''[[DVD Verdict]]'', said, "If only the filmmakers had followed their own tagline, "Hide the cheeseâ€¦" The cheese is in full view, and it stinks to boot". Noel Gross, writing for ''[[DVD Talk]]'', said that the film is "Yawnsville story about a gaggle of cookie-cutter college kiddos who decide to get their party started at an abandoned building where a disgraced professor is trying to cure cancer by juicing lab rats full of glowing green goo a la ''Re-Animator''."
