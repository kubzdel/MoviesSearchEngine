Aimi, a teenage girl and her [[alcoholic]] father move into an old, [[apartment building]]. Her mother died two years ago in an accident, and her father hasn't been able to recover from the incident. Things soon become worse as the two learn that the apartment is haunted. The [[landlord]] warns Aimi and her father of the rules. The first rule being that no one can move out until a new tenant arrives. The second rule is whenever a resident leaves and returns to the building, they must cross the rope in front of the property by midnight, or if they fail to return during the given [[curfew]], then they will suffer a horrible death by a mysterious force. Aimi soon begins to see visions of a girl who doesn't exist. She learns that the girl is named Ai, and lived in the apartment 30 years ago, but mysteriously vanished one day on her way home from school. Aimi finds out the secret of being raped by their fathers that the two girls share. Ai kills Aimi's father.
