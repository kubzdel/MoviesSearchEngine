'''''Romasanta''''', also known as '''''Romasanta, la caza de la bestia''''', is a 2004 Spanish-Italian-British [[horror film]] directed by [[Paco Plaza]] and starring [[Julian Sands]], [[Elsa Pataky]] and [[John Sharian]].  It is available on DVD from [[Lion's Gate Entertainment]] under the title ''Werewolf Hunt''.

Based on a script by Alfredo Conde, according to the end credits the film is based on a true story, that of [[Manuel Blanco Romasanta]], Spain’s first documented serial killer. Conde is a descendant of one of the doctors involved the original ''Werewolf of Allariz'' court case that took place in 1853/54 in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]. He went on to write a fictional novel, ''The Uncertain Memoirs of a Galician Wolfman: Romasanta.''<ref>Alfredo Conde ''The Uncertain Memoirs of a Galician Wolfman: Romasanta'' Antípodas Monographs 2006 {{ISBN|0-9775868-0-4}}</ref> The same case previously provided the basis for the 1968 Spanish film ''[[El bosque del lobo]]'' ("The Wolf's Forest").

==Synopsis==
The story takes place in 1851 in a small Spanish village apparently plagued by what we would now call a [[serial killer]], as corpses are discovered bearing both savage mutilation and precise surgical incisions. Clues point toward Manuel Romasanta ([[Julian Sands]]), who confesses to the crimes, but claims that he is a victim of [[lycanthropy]]. A scientist, Professor Philips (David Gant), argues that Romasanta suffers not from a supernatural curse but from a [[mental disorder]].

== Reception ==
In ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', critic Jonathan Holland wrote: "Spinning something cinematically new out of lycanthropy is always a challenge, but director Paco Plaza intermittently achieves it with his sophomore feature. (...) Offbeat pic is cleverly ambiguous where it counts; however, it lacks dramatic focus. (...) Sands' wolfish visage provides an appropriately sexy combination of attraction and threat, and script is clever enough to coax out some sympathy for him during the final 20 minutes. As Barbara, Pataky turns in a career-best perf."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Jonathan|title=Romasanta|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/reviews/romasanta-1200532917/|website=Variety|accessdate=5 March 2018|date=June 8, 2004}}</ref>
