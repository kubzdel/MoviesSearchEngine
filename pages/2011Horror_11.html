'''''The Amityville Haunting''''' is a 2011 [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film]] released on December 13, 2011. The film is inspired by the 1977 book ''[[The Amityville Horror]]''. The film was produced by [[The Asylum]] and Taut Productions.

The film is directed by Geoff Meed and stars Tyler Shamy, Devin Clark, and Jon Kondelik, all of whom are uncredited. The [[tagline]] is "The family did not survive. But the recordings did." It claims to be based on "actual [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] that documents the horrifying experiences of a family that moved into the infamous haunted house."

Although the poster features the traditional quarter round windows and [[gambrel]] roof of 112 Ocean Avenue, they are never seen on screen.

==Plot==
In June 2008, the Benson family moves into 112 Ocean Avenue, [[Amityville, New York|Amityville]], due to issues with their teenage daughter, Lori. Despite the disturbing history of the house where [[Ronald DeFeo Jr.]] shot and killed six members of his family in 1974, the Bensons agree to purchase the house. Upon their decision, they walk outside to find their realtor dead in their driveway. The following day, Tyler Benson witnesses one of the movers falling down the stairs, which kills him instantly. The family continues to live in the house, despite the tension growing from the unexplainable events occurring.

From doors opening, to a mysterious phone appearing in the kitchen, paranormal phenomena continue to bother Tyler, while his parents refuse to believe that there is anything happening beyond their own explanation. Douglas Benson takes matters into his own hands when he decides to install [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras in the house. Young Melanie Benson attracts the attention of the family when she starts talking to her "imaginary friend" [[Ronald DeFeo Jr.|John Matthew]], which leads Douglas to wonder if Lori or Tyler told Melanie about the history of the house.

As the family grows more fearful of the unexplainable deaths of a close family friend and a neighbor boy who was attracted to Lori, Douglas starts to break down, using religious paraphernalia to rid the house of any spirits that reside within the house. After one month within the house, Lori, Virginia, Douglas and Tyler Benson all die in various manners. Melanie Benson is the only survivor, as she says that she has plans to stay in the house forever, along with John Matthew. The autopsy reports shown at the end of the film place emphasis on the fact that each victim was under extreme stress at the time of their death.

==Reception==
''The Amityville Haunting'' received negative reviews from critics. A Horrornews.net writer called it "simply just a bad movie with no offering for viewers whatsoever", criticizing the over-used low-budget scare tricks and its false advertising as "Actual found footage". He also described Jason Williams' performance as Doug as "not believable for what its trying to achieve and simply comes off as d*ck with an attitude", but said that "The military freak-out tops the icing by just making it all seem rather silly".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/46385/film-review-the-amityville-haunting-2012/|title=Film Review: The Amityville Haunting (2012)|publisher=Horrornews.net|date=January 8, 2012|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref> [[Dread Central]]'s Foywonder scored it a one out of five, concluding his review with "A part of me almost wonders if the only reason ''The Amityville Haunting'' even exists is because someone made a bet that they could dethrone ''[[Amityville 3D]]'' for the title of worst “Amityville” movie of all time. I don’t know if they succeeded here, but they sure give it a run for its money."<ref>{{cite web|author=Foywonder|date=December 30, 2011|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/29341/amityville-haunting-the-dvd/|title=Amityville Haunting, The (DVD)|publisher=[[Dread Central]]|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref>
