'''''Chillerama''''' is a 2011 [[horror comedy]] [[anthology film]] consisting of four stories (or segments) that take place at a [[drive-in theater]] playing monster movies. Each segment is a homage to a different genre and style.<ref name="Dread Set Visit pg1"/>

The first is "Wadzilla" and was directed and written by [[Adam Rifkin]] spoofing 1950s [[monster movie]]s. The second segment is "I Was a Teenage Werebear" and was directed and written by [[Tim Sullivan (director)|Tim Sullivan]] which parodies ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' and is set in 1962.   The third is called "The Diary of Anne Frankenstein" and was directed and written by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] and spoofs [[Frankenstein]] and [[The Diary of Anne Frank]].  The last segment is "Zom-B-Movie", a spoof of zombie films, and was directed and written by [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]]. Tying each segment of the anthology together is a framing story: a worker for the theater, in a drunken state, digs up his deceased wife's body and attempts oral sex on it, only for her to turn into a zombie and bite his genitals, causing him to slowly turn into a zombie between segments as he is working.

Filming took place in late 2010 and was released at Fantasy Filmfest on August 22, 2011.  On September 29, 2011, it was released to [[video on demand]] and on DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on November 29, 2011.

==Origin==
[[Adam Rifkin]] and [[Tim Sullivan (director)|Tim Sullivan]] met while working on ''[[Detroit Rock City (film)|Detroit Rock City]]'' and quickly discovered they shared a mutual love of horror, monster and drive-in b-movies,<ref name="Videoscope"/> so they began developing an idea to make an anthology called ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'',<ref name="FamousMonsters"/> loosely based on the magazine they'd grown up reading, and with each short dedicated to a different era in film. First they came up with names and mock-up posters for each of the mini-features: ''The Diary of Anne Frankenstein'' (1940s), ''I Was a Teenage Vampire'' (1950s) ''Zombie Drive-In'' (1960s) and ''Werewolf of Alcatraz'' (1970s).<ref name="FamousMonsters"/>  A deal with ''Famous Monsters'' magazine fell through, so it was pitched as a weekly [[MTV]] series to be hosted by [[KISS (band)|KISS]] frontman [[Gene Simmons]],<ref name="Videoscope"/> but reality television was beginning to dominate American airwaves, so the project was shelved.<ref name="Videoscope"/>

A few years later, Rifkin and Sullivan met with directors [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] and [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]] at [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]],<ref name="Videoscope"/><ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/> and the idea resurfaced.  Soon the quartet decided to make ''Chillerama'' as an independently produced film, with Green's studio, Ariescope Pictures, serving as the headquarters of operations.  'Due to estimated budgetary constraints, ''Werewolf of Alcatraz'' was dropped and replaced with ''Wadzilla'';<ref name="FamousMonsters"/> ''I Was a Teenage Vampire'' was changed to ''Teenage Werebear'' at Lynch's behest;<ref name="FamousMonsters"/> ''Zombie Drive-In'' became ''Zom-B-Movie''; and a fifth short called ''Deathication'' was added to the drive-in sequence to fake out viewers.

=="Wadzilla"==

===eBay controversy===

[[Image:Chillerama Sean Paul Lockhart eBay screen-cap.jpg|right|thumb|240px|alt=Screen-cap which was featured on eBay.|The offending still.]]In February 2012, writer/director [[Tim Sullivan (director)|Tim Sullivan]] began selling copies of the [[compact disc|CD]] soundtrack for ''I Was a Teenage Werebear'' on [[eBay]], and as a bonus he included an autographed 8x10 still (a screen-capture from the film) of star [[Brent Corrigan|Sean Paul Lockhart]] clad in a pair of red [[briefs]].  After a few of the auctions had ended, eBay suddenly pulled down the listing and canceled all finalized orders of the album and 8x10.  Initially Sullivan thought it was a mistake, but when he spoke to people in eBay’s safety & trust department, he was told that the auction included a photo of a man with "engorged genitalia"<ref name="Nuke"/> which they deemed "sexually and morally offensive."<ref name="Airlock"/><ref name="DoorQ"/>  The exact same photo appeared on the cover of the May 2011 issue of ''Odyssey'' magazine which has sold on eBay without incident,<ref name="xtra"/> and thus led Sullivan to believe he was being discriminated against because his auction's accompanying text emphasized the gay content of the production.<ref name="xtra"/>  Sullivan was initially told that he could re-list the auction, but only in the adults-only section of the site that features pornographic material.<ref name="Airlock2"/> After two failed appeals to reinstate the auction in the regular site, eBay told him that he couldn't relist it at all, even without the offending photo.<ref name="xtra"/>  Rather than wasting more time, energy and risk further jeopardizing his eBay seller feedback rating, Sullivan decided to give up and just sell the album and 8x10 directly from his [[Facebook]] page, instructing buyers to send him an email with the header: "Fuck yes, I wanna be sexually and morally offended!"<ref name="Werebearsbanned"/>

===Standalone DVD===

On September 20, 2012, writer/director Tim Sullivan began selling a stand-alone DVD of his segment, ''I Was a Teenage Werebear'' through his Facebook page.
<ref name="werebeardvd"/> Titled ''Uncut & Hairy Ultimate Edition'', this version is limited to 2500 copies and includes an extended version of the short with 5.1 audio and color correction, as well as assortment of extras which were not included on the ''Chillerama'' DVD.

===Stage musical===

Soon after ''Teenage Werebear'' was released, Tim Sullivan was approached by [[Sean Abley]],<ref name="Videoscope"/> a producer and filmmaker who had previously adapted cult films such as ''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]]'' and ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' to the stage, with the proposition of turning the short film into a full-length stage musical.  With Abley set to direct, Sullivan began writing additional songs and retained several cast and crew members, including [[Sean Paul Lockhart]], Anton Troy, Tom Colby and producer Adam Rifkin for a production which was originally announced to hit the stage in September 2012,<ref name="Videoscope"/><ref name="Werebearsbanned"/> though it didn't come to fruition by the projected date.

=="The Diary of Anne Frankenstein"==

===Premise===

"The Diary of Anne Frankenstein" is a black and white film about Hitler "trying to create the perfect killing machine to win the war".<ref name="EW1"/>

===Cast===

*[[Joel Moore|Joel David Moore]] as [[Adolf Hitler]]<ref name="EW1"/>
*[[Kristina Klebe]] as [[Eva Braun]]<ref name="JoBloFirstImage"/>
*[[Kane Hodder]] as Meshugannah<ref name="JoBloFirstImage"/>
*[[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] as Anne Frank's Father

===Production===

[[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] came into ''Chillerama'' with the title of this short already established, but he was encouraged to make it his own.  Green's first decision, given the delicate nature of the subject matter, was that the story had to be over-the-top and would have to "make a clown out of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]"<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/> to ensure no one would deem it offensive.  His second decision was casting [[Joel Moore]] in that role.  "If Joel Moore is Hitler," Green said, "there is absolutely no way you can take this seriously for a second."<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/>

Green then decided to hire a cast of German-speaking actors and, to make Hitler look like even more of a fool, have Moore speak gibberish throughout the film.  Green's idea was to have Moore sound slightly convincing as the film began to give audiences who don't comprehend German the idea that he was actually speaking the language, but as the film progresses "his German gets worse and worse,"<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/> ultimately devolving into total gibberish and random words and phrases, such as "[[Oshkosh B'gosh]]" and "[[Boba Fett]]."<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/>  Actress [[Kristina Klebe]] and her mother translated Green's script into German,<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/> and the cast rehearsed it two ways: first in English to get the rhythms down, and then in German as it would be shot.  For a few key moments, Moore was taught to speak German phrases, albeit not the ones that are subtitled on the screen.  For example, during his song "I Don't Want to Rule the World," instead of the titular line Moore sings, "Ich habe Würmer in meinem Schwanz," which means, "I have worms in my penis."<ref name="MakingAnneFrankenstein"/>

=="Zom-B-Movie"==

===Premise===

"Zom-B-Movie" is a spoof of '70s and '80s [[zombie films]] and was directed and written by [[Joe Lynch (director)|Joe Lynch]].<ref name="EW1"/>

===Cast===

*[[Richard Riehle]] as Cecil Kaufman
*Corey Jones as Tobe
*[[Kaili Thorne]] as Mayna
*[[Brendan McCreary]] as Ryan Miller
*[[Ward Roberts]] as Miller
