==Plot==
Chong-kwai welcomes his friends Ted, May, Kofei and cousin April from Hong Kong to Thailand. He shows them a book he purchased from a strange man, titled ''The Ten Encounters'', that describes ten ways to see ghosts and spirits.

If they start the game, they must complete it or they will be haunted forever. Out of curiosity, the five friends start playing. In the middle of the game, Kofei disappears. Chong-kwai's mother, who is an expert on the supernatural, warns the friends to leave Thailand but April stays behind because she wants to find Kofei (her boyfriend). One night, April tries one of the methods and brushes her hair in front of a mirror at night. Her fate is uncertain.

Back in Hong Kong, Ted and May continue to experience strange and ghostly encounters, with Ted being possessed by a ghost at one point. In Thailand, Chong-kwai sees that the drawings of characters in the book have been replaced by images of himself and his friends. Ted and May return to Thailand to complete the game, hoping that the curse will be broken after doing so. They perform the last step, which is to sleep while dressed in traditional garments for the deceased. In the ghost world, Ted and May find Kofei. April appears and helps them escape. All three ask April how she came to the ghost world and she tells them what happened. Thinking Kofei was dead, she committed suicide. Kofei decides to stay with April in the ghost world while Ted and May attempt to escape. However, when they wake up, they learn that they have become spirits. Chong-kwai and his mother attempt to revive Ted and May but fail. 

At the end, the sinister bookstore owner is seen selling another copy of the cursed book to an interested teenager.
