__TOC__
==Plot==
In the town of Golderton, crooked businessman Billy Butler (Michael Badalucco), reopens an abandoned gold mine.  It was closed after five miners were trapped in the mine sometime in the 1800s.  Centuries later, Butler, a descendant of the mine's owner, reopens it, unaware of the curse that was cast upon the site.  A creature, a monstrosity composed of the bodies of five deceased miners, awakens with the desire to kill anyone who takes its gold.  Two local policemen (Carl Savering and Robert Belushi) and a coroner (Cathy Shim), whose family has ties to the mine, team up to try to defeat the creature before Golderton becomes a ghost town full of lifeless bodies.
