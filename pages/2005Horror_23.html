== Plot ==
The film is a [[comedy|comedic]] [[parody]] of [[horror films]] of its time, with a cross between ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' with Kristen ([[Stormy Daniels|Daniels]]) and Megan ([[Jessica Drake|Drake]]) playing college students planning to attend a concert.  After they hit a [[homeless]] man with their car, the girls and their friends are systematically murdered.<ref name="HorrorTalk">HorrorTalk: "''[http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/CampCuddlyPines/CampCuddly.htm Camp Cuddly Pines Powertool Massacre]'' DVD Review."

== Reception ==
A horror movie critic wrote:  <blockquote>
...although Daniels has the perfect swollen-sweater-girl look as the blonde ditz, it’s Drake who steals the show as her snarkier and more sensible companion. Among the men, veterans [[Randy Spears]] and [[Mike Horner (pornographic actor)|Mike Horner]] have both made quite a reputation for their acting within the adult community — in both serious and humorous roles, sex and nonsex — and are as entertaining as expected. Meanwhile, Eric Masterson, the nominal male lead, plays a nebbishy film geek well, and Voodoo has a memorable comic turn as a jock/would-be tough guy.<ref name="HorrorTalk"/>
