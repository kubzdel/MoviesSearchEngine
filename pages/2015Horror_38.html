==Critical reception== 
''Chain Mail'' received negative reviews from film critics.

Philbert Ortiz from clickthecity.com gave a 2 and a half stars saying  " It isn't scary. It isn't affecting. It doesn't even make any sense. Its climax is a genuine mess, the film clearly trying to dig its way out of a bottomless narrative hole, leading to ridiculous sequences that make the characters look like complete morons. It doesn't feel like anyone really wanted to make this film, but it exists because of how the industry is run. It's all about showcasing young stars." <ref>{{cite news|url= http://m.clickthecity.com/movies/a/26735/commerce-trumps-story-in-chain-mail |title=Chain Mail|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=Nov 23, 2015}}</ref>

Oggs Cruz from [[rappler]] also gave a negative review from the film saying "On paper, Chain Mail is full of promise â€“ but it doesn't really deliver."
