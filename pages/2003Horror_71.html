== Synopsis ==
One morning after a typhoon, an old bomb from World War II is discovered in a construction site. The following day, one of the workers of the shipyard commits suicide by throwing himself on the road. From then on, inexplicable crimes succeed each other. The films narrative,  carried by a non-rhythm at once languid and repetitive until a relative hypnotic power. The Japan in the movie is contaminated and depopulated Japan, until the final of a punk-amazon revolt under the fire of the helicopters (and suddenly, in a simple use of the soundtrack, Propellers and submachine guns, minimalism shifts into the war film). <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmdeculte.com/cinema/actualite/National-Anthem-13957.html|title=Critique de Kansai, l'autre cinéma japonais: National Anthem de Hiroshi Nishio |website=www.filmdeculte.com}}</ref>
