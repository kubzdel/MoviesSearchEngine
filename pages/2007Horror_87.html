==Plot==
{{more plot|date=June 2017}}
The film is based on the true story of [[Ed Gein]], who skinned, disembowled, and dissected bodies he dug up from a graveyard in his hometown, [[Plainfield, Wisconsin]]. As a child, he was [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] by his mother, a religious fanatic who taught him that sex was evil and that all women, herself excluded, were sinful. He lived with her until well into adulthood, and began descending into mental illness following her death. He became a grave robber, digging up the bodies of middle-aged and elderly women and removing the skin to create a "woman suit" for himself; while wearing it, he would pretend to be his mother.

When he kidnapped 58-year-old Bernice Worden, the police came to Gein's farmhouse and found her dismembered and disemboweled corpse, as well as parts of at least 15 other corpses.

The movie plot centers on Gein kidnapping and slaughtering Vera Mason, the mother of Bobby Mason, a sheriff's deputy, and his girlfriend. The ensuing action focuses on the race to catch her, before it's too late. These later events are dramatic fictions.
