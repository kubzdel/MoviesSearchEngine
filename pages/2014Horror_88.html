==Synopsis==
Raphael (Brandyn T. Williams) is an executive on the cusp of either making it big or losing it all, depending on how a deal with a large distribution company goes. His co-worker Wayne (Britt Griffith) would love to see Raphael fail so he can himself progress within the business, a situation that is made worse when Raphael must take time off of work to go to the funeral of a family member in Metzburgh. On his way to Metzburgh, Raphael witnesses a Grim Reaper claiming a soul and ends up becoming a Grim Reaper himself. Raphael now has to find out what he's willing to do to get this status reversed and what Death (Michael Sciabarrasi) himself has planned for him.
