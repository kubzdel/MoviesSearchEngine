'''''Hostel: Part II''''' is a 2007 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Eli Roth]], and starring [[Lauren German]], [[Roger Bart]], [[Heather Matarazzo]], [[Bijou Phillips]], and [[Richard Burgi]]. The sequel to Roth's ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005), the film was produced by Chris Briggs, [[Mike Fleiss]], and Eli Roth, with [[Boaz Yakin]], [[Scott Spiegel]], and [[Quentin Tarantino]] serving as executive producers. The plot follows three American female art students in [[Rome]] who are directed to a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] village where they are kidnapped and taken to a facility in which rich clients pay to torture and kill people.

After the significant box office receipts of 2005's ''Hostel'', Roth conceived a sequel set directly after the events of the first film, opting to include three female protagonists to "up the ante."<ref name=el/> Filming took place in the fall of 2006 in [[Prague]] at [[Barrandov Studios]], with additional photography occurring in [[Iceland]] and Slovakia.

Banned from theatrical release in several countries, ''Hostel: Part II'' had its world premiere at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in New York City on June 6, 2007, and was released theatrically in the United States two days later, on June 8. The film earned less than its predecessor at the box office, grossing $17 million in the United States by the end of its theatrical run<ref name="BOM">{{mojo title|hostel2}}</ref> whereas the original made $19 million in its opening weekend alone. Prior to its theatrical release, a [[workprint]] of the film leaked on the Internet, and one publication at the time claimed it was the "most pirated film ever",<ref name=pirate/> which Roth suggested was a factor in the film's box office returns.

==Plot==
Shortly after the events of ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', Paxton is suffering from nightmares as a result of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and lives in seclusion with his girlfriend Stephanie back in the US. The two get into an argument when Stephanie denounces Paxton's paranoia as exaggerated and insufferable. She wakes up the next morning to find Paxton [[Decapitation|decapitated]]. An unmarked box (presumably containing Paxton's severed head) is then delivered to Elite Hunting boss Sasha, as he relaxes at an outdoor cafe.

In [[Rome]], three American art students, Beth, Whitney, and Lorna, are convinced by Axelle, a nude model they are sketching, to join her on a luxurious spa vacation in [[Slovakia]]. The four check into the [[hostel]], where the desk clerk uploads their passport photos to an auction website, and American businessman Todd submits the winning bids on Whitney and Beth for himself and his passive best friend Stuart and they travel to Slovakia.

Later that night, at the village's weekend-long [[harvest festival]], Lorna discovers that Beth has inherited a vast fortune from her mother. Stuart and Todd go to the festival, where Stuart approaches Beth and the two share a friendly, albeit awkward, conversation where Stuart says her name. When she uncomfortably asks him how he knew her name, he said her friend told him. A strange local man tries to dance with an intoxicated Beth but when she rejects him,the strange man says "I could have helped you".The desk clerk approaches Beth and asks her if that guy was troubling her to which she replies in the negative. The clerk offers her beer but she throws it away. Meanwhile, Lorna tells Beth that Roman, a new acquaintance at the Fair wants to take her on a boat ride. Beth requests Lorna to stay back but she doesn't listen to her and sets off on the boat ride. In a secluded area, Roman kidnaps her with the help of two accomplices. Beth and Whitney leave the festival, and Axelle volunteers to stay behind and wait for Lorna. Whitney wants to have sex with a local named Miroslav, but Beth refuses to leave them alone together.

The following morning, Lorna wakes up hung upside down, naked, with her wrists chained behind her back. A woman enters the room, and lies naked in a bathtub beneath her. She then uses a [[scythe]] to repeatedly slash Lorna's back, and bathes in her blood, before finally slashing her throat. Meanwhile, Beth, Whitney, Axelle, and Miroslav head to the local spa to relax.  Beth dozes off, and awakens to find herself alone and her belongings stolen. While looking for her friends, she notices several men approaching her. Fearing for her life, she climbs over the spa walls. While escaping, she is ambushed by a gang of violent street children known as 'the Bubblegum Gang' but Sasha and Axelle arrive and save her. After Axelle and Beth leave, Sasha executes one of the children.

While at Sasha's mansion, Beth is again pursued by the men who chased her earlier, and realizes Sasha and Axelle are behind it. She tries to hide and discovers a room filled with human [[Headhunting|trophy heads]] (including Paxton's) before she is captured and taken to the factory.  Having been notified via [[pager]], Todd and Stuart are chauffeured to the factory. Stuart enters his room where Beth is strapped to a chair with a sack covering her head. After looking around the room in horror, he takes the sack off Beth's head and explains what is going on. He unties her from the chair and almost decides to let her escape, but knocks her out and restrains her, having decided to take his anger for his domineering wife out on Beth.

Meanwhile, Todd terrorizes Whitney with a [[power saw]] but loses his nerve after inadvertently [[scalping]] her. Horrified by what he has done, he tries to leave, but one of the guards reminds him that he is contractually obligated to finish her. Todd refuses, prompting the other guards to turn savage dogs loose on him, who maul Todd to death. The Elite Hunting representatives try to find someone else to finish off Whitney and inquire with other patrons, including an Italian man who is [[Cannibalism|eating]] Miroslav alive. Stuart is approached by the representatives, and after discovering that Todd has been killed, he accepts the offer and beheads her.  

When Stuart returns Beth seduces him into releasing her from the chair. Stuart attempts to rape her, but she fights him off and chains him to the chair instead. She demands the code to the cell door from Stuart, but still needs to be buzzed through, which inadvertently summons Sasha and the guards to the room. Beth offers to buy her freedom with part of her inheritance, but Sasha explains that in order to leave she must also kill someone. When Stuart insults Beth, she cuts off his genitals and tosses them to one of the guard dogs, leaving him to bleed to death. Per the standard contract Beth is given an Elite Hunting tattoo, making her an official member.

That night, Axelle is lured from the village harvest festival into the woods by the Bubblegum Gang, where she is surprised by Beth. After Beth beheads her with an axe the children start playing soccer with Axelle's severed head.

==Production==
===Casting===
Roth sought Lauren German for the lead role based on her performance in ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).<ref name=el>{{cite web|work=EmanuelLevy.com|author=Levy, Emanuel|url=http://emanuellevy.com/interviews/hostel-part-ii-roth-on-his-gory-sequel-8/|title=Hostel Part II: Roth on his Gory Sequel|date=June 3, 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/20171023025715/http://emanuellevy.com/interviews/hostel-part-ii-roth-on-his-gory-sequel-8/|archivedate=October 23, 2017|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "Lauren has a sense of humor, but she can also handle those horrific, intense moments," explained Roth. "I needed an actress who would be so vulnerable and so likeable, but then really strong when she needs to be. Even though Lauren probably weighs ninety pounds soaking wet and looks like a princess, you feel like she's kicking ass."<ref name=el/> Bijou Phillips was cast as Whitney after impressing Roth with her audition.<ref name=el/> For the part of Lorna, Roth had Heather Matarazzo in mind from the beginning; she flew to Los Angeles to read for the part, unaware that Roth was meeting to offer it to her.<ref name=el/>

Vera Jordanova was cast as Axelle, a female antagonist, while former [[Slovakia|Slovak]] Minister of Culture and actor [[Milan Kňažko]], was given the role of Sasha, the Russian mafia member and ringleader of the torture factory.<ref name=el/> "The fact that Sasha was Russian was one of the reasons I accepted this role," Kňažko joked. "We Slovaks are still a little bit angry over the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet army."<ref name=el/> To play Stuart and Todd, the American businessmen who are "emblematic of the more extreme sides of human natureand the dark shadow of First World materialism," Roth cast Roger Bart and Richard Burgi.<ref name=el/>

===Filming===

Principal photography began on September 11, 2006, in Prague's [[Barrandov Studios]].<ref name=el/> Much of the underground tunnel sequences in the torture factory were filmed in sets constructed at the studio, while additional photography took place in and around Prague.<ref name=el/> The unnamed village where the protagonists stay and attend the harvest festival is [[Český Krumlov]], located in the Czech Republic's [[South Bohemian Region]].<ref name=el/> The brick-and-mortar exteriors of the factory were constructed by production designer Robert Wilson King, and based on real abandoned factories he and Roth had toured abroad.<ref name=el/> Roth shot scenes for the film in the [[brothel]] [[Big Sister (brothel)|Big Sister]],<ref name=el/> and the spa sequence was shot on location at the at [[Blue Lagoon (geothermal spa)|the Blue Lagoon]] near [[Reykjavík]] in [[Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web|work=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1555181/filming-partying-dieting-abroad-eli-roths-hostel-part-ii-column/|title=Filming, Partying, Dieting Abroad: Eli Roth's 'Hostel: Part II' Column|date=March 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171023031648/http://www.mtv.com/news/1555181/filming-partying-dieting-abroad-eli-roths-hostel-part-ii-column/|archivedate=October 23, 2017|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 

The special effects in the film were created by [[Gregory Nicotero]] and [[Howard Berger]], who had worked with Roth on the previous film.<ref name=el/> Actress Phillips claimed that her torture sequence, which entails her being [[scalping|scalped]] by a power saw, required around forty-five setups.<ref name=el/> "I don't think I could do something like this again," she stated in a 2007 interview. "I'm glad that I had the experience, and I love my job, but we went into places that I didn't know existed, and I don't need to do that again."<ref name=el/> Matarazzo's elaborate murder sequence required the actress to hang upside down, nude, with her hands chained to her back. Matarazzo performed the scene herself, and was hung upside down in five-minute intervals over a period of two days.<ref name=el/>

On October 8, 2007, the film was cited in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] as an example where stills from the film could be illegal to possess under the proposed law to criminalise possession of "[[Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008|extreme pornography]]".

===Critical reception===
Internet [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] shows the film has a 44% approval rating based on 110 reviews; the average rating is 5/10.

Laura Kern of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the film: "Benefiting from a higher budget, Eli Roth’s follow-up to his generally odious ''Hostel'' may sport glossier production values, but its driving motivation — to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness — remains just as low."<ref>{{cite web|author=Kern, Laura|title=Inside the Torture Factory|date=June 7, 2007|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 22, 2017|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/movies/08host.html}}</ref> In ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Michael Rechtshaffen called the film "a step up in virtually every aspect, from production values to its better focused storytelling and more fully developed characters, while not exactly skimping on all that blood-soaked torture and depravity that made it such a draw in the first place."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Hostel: Part II|author=Rechtshaffen, Michael|date=June 7, 2007|accessdate=October 22, 2017|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hostel-part-ii-159103}}</ref> Elizabeth Weitzman of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' also thought the film was "smarter and tougher than its predecessor."<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|author=Weitzman, Elizabeth|title=A sequel bound for gory|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/sequel-bound-gory-article-1.221403|date=June 8, 2007|accessdate=October 23, 2017}}</ref>

In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', Nathan Lee wrote that the film's realistic representation of violence, but criticized the conclusion: "Ends up there is a moral to the story, one sure to delight the bamboozled pseudo-intellectuals who laughably defended Hostel as a geo-political critique of American arrogance and the culture of torture. Having survived her ordeal in classic Final Girl style, our mega-rich heroine simply buys her way to freedom. Eli Roth punks capitalism all the way to the bank with cheap tricks and bankrupt imagination."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Village Voice]]|title=Evil Dead|author=Lee, Nathan|date=June 5, 2007|accessdate=December 19, 2008|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/film/0724,lee,76886,20.html|deadurl=yes|archivedate=December 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210202819/http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-06-05/film/evil-dead/}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described Roth's "B-movie reflexes" and wrote, "''Hostel: Part II'', despite its lousy opening weekend, is an authentic real-world creep show—better, if anything, than its predecessor."<ref>{{cite web|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|date=June 22, 2017|accessdate=October 22, 2017|title=Hostel Part II|url=http://ew.com/article/2007/06/13/hostel-part-ii-2/}}</ref>

In a retrospective assessment of the film in 2017, Nick Thorn of ''The Film Stage'' praised ''Hostel: Part II'', citing perceived [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] undercurrents and its doubled narrative perspective as primary reasons: {{quote|By extending its narrative reach to include the Hostel “clients” as well as its prisoners, ''Part II'' deepens its moral and political insights. The audience is asked not only to empathize with the victims, but also to recognize its own complicity as spectators. This broadened perspective also substantiates Roth’s sustained homage to Italian horror auteur [[Sergio Martino]]; like Martino’s excellent ''[[Torso (1973 film)|Torso]]'' (1973), ''Hostel: Part II'' oscillates visually and narratively between different subjective positions to disturb the viewer and to complicate their political assumptions... In 2007, the film’s box-office earnings and critical reception suggested a pale and unsuccessful sequel. A decade later, ''Hostel: Part II'' stands out as one of the most urgent, combative, and complicated American horror movies of its time.<ref name=thorn>{{cite web|work=The Film Stage|author=Thorn, Nick|date=June 8, 2017|accessdate=October 23, 2017|url=https://thefilmstage.com/features/hostel-part-ii-and-the-monster-of-neoliberal-late-capitalism/|title=‘Hostel: Part II’ and the Monster of Neoliberal Late-Capitalism}}</ref>}}
