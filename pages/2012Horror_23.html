'''''The Apparition''''' is a 2012 American-German [[supernatural horror film]], written and directed by Todd Lincoln, making his directorial debut, and starring [[Ashley Greene]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Tom Felton]], [[Julianna Guill]] and [[Rick Gomez]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/03/19/the-kick-ass-ladies-of-sxsw-ashley-greene | title=The Kick-Ass Ladies of SXSW: Ashley Greene| publisher=Cinematical / [[Moviefone]]| first=Jen |last=Yamato | date =March 19, 2010 |accessdate= August 23, 2012}}</ref> The plot follows three college students who, after the death of their friend, must battle a supernatural force they summoned themselves. The film was loosely inspired by the [[Philip experiment]] conducted in 1972.<ref name="insi_‘The">{{Cite web| title = ‘The Apparition’ director Todd Lincoln talks about his new horror movie — and terrorizing ‘Twilight’ fans| author = Clark Collis| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]| date = 2012-08-23| accessdate = 2015-01-16| url = http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/08/23/the-apparition-twilight-harry-potter/}}</ref> The film was a [[box office bomb]] and was cited by critics as one of the worst horror movies of 2012. It was also the last [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] horror film to date to be released under its own label before resorting to [[New Line Cinema]] to release all future horror movies made by Warner Bros.

==Plot==
On May 21, 1973, six people conduct The Charles Experiment, a [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] experiment, in which they stare at a drawing of a deceased man, Charles Reamer, hoping to summon his spirit. Years later, four college students, Patrick ([[Tom Felton]]), Lydia ([[Julianna Guill]]), Ben ([[Sebastian Stan]]) and Greg ([[Luke Pasqualino]]) attempt to recreate the Charles Experiment on a larger scale by using modern technology. During the experiment, something attacks the students and pulls Lydia into the wall.

Some time later, Ben and his girlfriend Kelly ([[Ashley Greene]]) are living together. One evening, they discover strange burn marks on their counters. Kelly finds both doors wide open, even though they had locked them. They decide to change the locks and install surveillance cameras. Later, Kelly finds a large amount of mold and spores on the laundry room floor while Ben finds even more in a [[crawl space (basement)|crawlspace]]. Ben gets 36 "urgent" emails from Patrick that first inform him of a new attempt at the Charles Experiment, followed by a warning that "containment failed" and finally "you are in danger".

After witnessing an apparition, the couple go to a hotel, but they are attacked there as well. As they flee, they receive a call from Patrick and meet him. Patrick explains that the initial experiment enabled a malevolent entity to enter their world, but that he has built a room surrounded by a negative current that he believes protects him from it. They return to Kelly and Ben's house to try a new experiment to contain the entity. During the experiment, the house begins to shake and break apart, then abruptly stops. While Kelly and Ben are outside, Patrick is pulled into the darkness and vanishes. Unable to find Patrick, they flee to the safety chamber in his house.

Inside the house, they hear Patrick's personal log being played back, including information about the members of the original experiment. Of the original six, two died, one committed suicide and the other three disappeared. After entering the safety chamber, Ben disappears. Kelly exits the chamber and finds Ben's contorted corpse. Patrick's narration explains that the entity gets stronger with each person it claims, and that it will wear its victims down until they are too weak to resist.

With no escape, Kelly wanders around, and enters an empty [[Costco]]. She walks to the camping section, enters a tent and waits to be killed by the entity, having fully given up resisting. A number of hands appear from behind and the entity slowly grabs hold of her as the movie cuts to black.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''The Apparition'' was criticized for its lack of originality, overuse of jump scares, poor acting and screenplay, and bad plot. It has an overall approval rating of 3% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 2.3/10. The consensus says, "''The Apparition'' fails to offer anything original, isn't particularly scary, and offers so little in the way of dramatic momentum that it's more likely to put you to sleep than thrill you."<ref>{{rottentomatoes|the_apparition}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 18 out of 100, indicating "Overwhelming dislike".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-apparition|title=The Apparition|publisher=}}</ref> Much of the film's criticisms referred to a lack of originality, and similarities to other horror films, including ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge]]'', ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'', ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'', and ''[[Pulse (2001 film)|Pulse]]''. Brian Orndof from Blu-ray.com said, "The trailer for ''The Apparition'' contained more story than the picture it was promoting. In fact, I think the trailer for ''The Apparition'' is actually more of a movie than ''The Apparition.''" Mark Dujsik agreed, saying, "It's so terrible that there might actually be more tension in the numbing first act of monotonous chores than there is in anything that follows."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markreviewsmovies.com/reviews/A/apparition.htm|title=THE APPARITION|author=Mark Dujsik|publisher=Mark Reviews Movies|date=August 23, 2012|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}</ref> [[IndieWire]] called the film a "hauntingly inept chiller", feeling that the film "makes no attempts to transcend or even enliven its genre".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/review-the-apparition-is-a-hauntingly-inept-chiller-20120824|title=Review: ‘The Apparition’ Is A Hauntingly Inept Chiller|first=Drew|last=Taylor|date=24 August 2012|publisher=}}</ref> RedEye Chicago called the film "hilariously non-scary".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.redeyechicago.com/2012-08-23/entertainment/33346942_1_multiple-times-green-thumbs-ashley-greene|title=Movie review: 'The Apparition'|publisher=}}</ref>
