'''''Dead And Deader''''' is a 2006 zombie horror comedy film directed by [[Patrick Dinhut]]. The movies stars [[Dean Cain]], [[Guy Torry]], [[Peter Greene]], and [[Susan Ward]], with cameos from [[Armin Shimerman]], [[John Billingsley]], and [[Dean Haglund]].<ref>[http://www.blogomatic3000.com/2010/09/10/alt-tv-10910/ Alt.TV – 10/9/10]</ref>  It was aired from [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] on December 16, 2006.

==Plot==
After communications to a small medical outpost in [[Cambodia]] was cut off, a U.S. special-forces squad was sent to investigate. As they approach the outpost they are attacked by zombies. As the zombies are dispatched, Lieutenant Bobby Quinn survives with heavy injuries. He radios for a medivac airlift, then falls unconscious.

Quinn wakes up on an exam table at Ft. Preston Army Base. The shocked coroner explains that he arrived in a body-bag and had been pronounced [[Dead on arrival|DOA]]. Suddenly feeling a pain in his right arm, Quinn grabs a scalpel and cuts it open. Gushing out of the wound is green blood and a strange scorpion, which he crushes. The incision then rapidly heals, and Quinn finds that he now possesses superhuman strength. He also begins feeling intense hunger that can only be dulled by ingesting raw, red meat.

Quinn fights his way out of the army base and leaves to find his fellow squad-members. He stops at a small road-side bar and meets Holly, a part-time bartender. The local news had aired a report about the killings at Fort Preston, labeling Quinn a suspect. The bar patrons lock him inside the cooler. The bar is then attacked by Zombies. Holly frees Quinn, and they fight their way out.

Quinn eventually learns that a doctor named Dr. Scott plans to use the scorpion venom to revive dead tissues and sell for a profit. Quinn and Holly follow Dr. Scott back to Ft. Preston, where Scott is killed by zombies attempting to extract a scorpion. After destroying the scorpion and killing all of the zombies, Holly and Quinn escape from the base and leave.

Outside the base, Quinn and Holly lure zombies toward the armory, blowing it up using a stash of ammunition. They narrowly escape as the base goes up in flames. After making sure no zombies survive, they walk away together.

''Dead and Deader'' was director Patrick Dinhut's first feature film.<ref name=bloody/> It is a lighthearted zombie movie, and has a strong comedic bent.{{who|date=May 2018}} The film is filled with of pop-culture references and joking asides, including to ''[[Star Wars]]'' and  ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''. For example, the character Judson hints about Dean Cain's role as Superman on ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', at one point suggesting that Quinn use "heat vision" as a means of escape from a cooler.

Several characters have names containing pop culture references. For example, [[Armin Shimerman]] plays a character named "Flutie", which is a reference to his role on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Shimerman he played [[principal Snyder]], the successor to a principal named "Flutie". There is also a debate between Pvt. Connery and Pvt. Lazenby on the merits of various versions of ''[[James Bond]]'' actors. [[Sean Connery]] and [[George Lazenby]] were actors who played James Bond. The soldiers' conversation mirrors dialogue by director and writer [[Kevin Smith]].<ref>[http://splattermovies.blog.de/2008/01/18/dead_and_deader_invasion_der_zombies~3598336/ Dead and Deader- Invasion der Zombies - Splattermovies]</ref>

==Reception==
Travis Estvold of ''[[Boise Weekly]]'' wrote "It probably would've done better as a 45-minute episode of The Outer Limits rather than as a feature film, except it may have even given that show a bad name".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/dead-and-deader/Content?oid=931660|title=Dead and Deader|last=Estvold|first=Travis|work=[[Boise Weekly]]|date=2007-04-18|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref>  Jon Condit of [[Dread Central]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote "By the time the closing credits rolled, ''Dead and Deader'' felt less like a new movie and more like a rejected mid-80s TV pilot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4533/dead-and-deader-2006/|title=Dead and Deader (2006)|last=Condit|first=Jon|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2006-12-17|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref>

[[Bloody Disgusting]] rated the film 3.5/5 stars, and wrote "Truth be told for a low budget feature that made its debut on the Sci-Fi Channel it definitely has its moments".<ref name=bloody>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109856/dead-and-deader-v-2/|title=Dead and Deader (V)|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2007-04-16|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref>  Scott Weinberg of [[DVD Talk]] rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote "It's nothing but a low-budget, tongue-in-cheek mixture of ''Blade'', ''48 HRS.'', ''28 Days Later'', and any 'angry commando' action flick you can imagine – but it's also kinda fun, too".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27425/dead-and-deader/|title=Dead and Deader|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2007-04-10|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref>

Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said, "The film's promising opening deteriorates into buffoonery and yawny punch-lines."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000–2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=60–61|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>
