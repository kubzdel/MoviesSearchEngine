==Plot==
Hae-won is a middle-rank officer working in a Seoul bank. A stern, tense, single woman, she is brought down by work-related stress and her hypercompetitive environment. Desperate for a change of pace, she takes up an offer from a long-forgotten friend to take a vacation in Mudo, a desolate Southern island where she spent childhood. Arriving at the island, she is warmly welcomed by Bok-nam, with whom she had a close friendship when both were in their teens, but whose constant letters she's since ignored. Life on the undeveloped, socially regressive island is hard, and Bok-nam is treated as little more than a slave by her abusive husband Man-jong, his brother, and the local old women. All of Bok-nam's love is reserved for her young daughter Yeon-hee, with whom she tries to escape from the small, claustrophobic island. When the attempt is foiled by Man-jong and his friends, Bok-nam finally snaps, murdering the island's inhabitants with a sickle trying to get revenge for killing her daughter Yeon-hee.She moves to Seoul and tries to kill her childhood friend Hae-won mentioning that she was so unkind to help her.But finally Hae-won kills Bok-nam from her flute striking her neck.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Kyu Hyun|title=Bedevilled|url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm10.html#bedeviled|work=Koreanfilm.org|accessdate=2012-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Elley|first=Derek|title=Bedevilled|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/bedevilled|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Film Business Asia]]|date=15 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Von Hoeij|first=Boyd|title=Bedevilled|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942717|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=14 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Grotesque, disturbing revenge tale from savage isle|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2925184|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127131721/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2925184|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 January 2013|accessdate=2012-11-19|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=27 August 2010}}</ref>
