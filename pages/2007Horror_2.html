'''''28 Weeks Later''''' is a 2007  [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Juan Carlos Fresnadillo]]. A sequel to [[Danny Boyle]]'s ''[[28 Days Later]]'' (2002), it stars [[Robert Carlyle]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Jeremy Renner]], [[Harold Perrineau]], [[Catherine McCormack]], [[Imogen Poots]], and [[Idris Elba]]. The plot depicts the efforts of [[NATO]] military forces to salvage a safe zone in London following the events in ''28 Days Later'', the consequence of two young siblings breaking protocol to find their infected mother, and the resulting reintroduction of the highly contagious virus to the safe zone. It was released in the United Kingdom and United States on 11 May 2007.

==Plot==
During the original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice and four more survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of [[London]]. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and let him in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to abandon the boy but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected break into their room by busting out of the window. Don sprints to a nearby motorboat, narrowly escaping after a tussle with a recently turned survivor.

After the infected begin to die of starvation, [[NATO]] forces take control of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American commanded force, under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Stone, brings in settlers. Among the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were out of the country during the outbreak. They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the [[Isle of Dogs]], guarded by the [[United States Army|US Army]]. Sergeant Doyle, a [[Delta Force]] sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the troops guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father, who was found by the US Army and has become the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about the circumstances surrounding their mother's death.

That night, Andy dreams about forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone and return to their former home, where they collect family photographs and other mementos. To his shock, Andy finds Alice alive and uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is tested and found to be an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of the rage virus.  Don makes an unauthorised visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him; when they kiss, Don is infected, savagely kills her and goes on a rampage.

General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and orders a Code Red alert in District One. Civilians are herded into safe rooms but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room full of people and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The crowd, with half its members infected, breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a US Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy and several others through the [[Greenwich Foot Tunnel]]. Stone orders District One to be firebombed but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected.

Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle but refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who might be infected. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to leave the civilians and head to [[Wembley Stadium]]. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape [[nerve gas]] released to kill the infected but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is flamed. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the [[London Underground]], where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy.

Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the [[English Channel]] to [[France]], as instructed by Doyle. Twenty-eight days later, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel which, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the [[Paris Métro]] [[Trocadéro (Paris Métro)|Trocadéro Station]] with a view across the Seine to the nearby [[Eiffel Tower]].

In 2003, plans for the film were conceived after the international success of ''[[28 Days Later]]''.

In March 2005, Boyle said in an interview that he would not direct the sequel due to commitments to ''[[Sunshine (2007 film)|Sunshine]]'' (2007), but he would serve as [[executive producer]].

On 13 April 2013, Boyle stated: "[I]t’s 40/60 whether [a sequel] happens or not. But we did have an idea of where to set it and what it might be about."

We’ve got an idea. Danny [Boyle] and [producer] Andrew [Macdonald] and I have been having quite serious conversations about it so it is a possibility. It’s complicated. There’s a whole bunch of reasons why it’s complicated, which are boring so I won’t go into, but there’s a possibility," also adding: "It’s more likely to be 28 Months than 28 Years. 28 months gives you one more place to go," hinting at the possibility of a fourth film as well.<ref>{{cite web | title=Alex Garland Says 28 Months Later is Being Discussed | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/14/alex-garland-says-28-months-later-is-being-discussed |  website=IGN| accessdate=1 February 2015 }}</ref>
