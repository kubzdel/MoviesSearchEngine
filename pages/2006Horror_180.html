==Plot==
Eighteen-year-old Kristel survives a car accident in which her father dies. Tormented by nocturnal visions she continues her father's investigation of serial killers - especially Andries Martíns, a child killer. She decides to visit an abandoned mine, with a little group of friends from college, where her father headed the investigations on Andries. In the dark, abandoned mine shafts, convicted murderers used to be used as 'firefighters' to detect explosives, which was a job that normally nobody survived.

When the group arrives at the mine, the shaft lift suddenly drops 60 metres. The students must now find a way out of the dilapidated mine maze but they are not alone. The spirit of Martins is more bloodthirsty than ever. Kristel and her friends spend the night in the mine but the trip becomes more and more of a nightmare and a battle for survival.
