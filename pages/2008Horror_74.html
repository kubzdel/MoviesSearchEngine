Reviewers note the film for being representative of low-budget films being created for and aired on the Sci-Fi Channel.

==Plot==
Six teenagers on a chaperoned rehabilitation camping trip find themselves being hunted by mutant giant birds infected with a mysterious virus that changed the birds into deadly predators.

Porky is the first to be injured by the birds. The teens devise a plan to escape, with Johnson proclaiming himself leader. When the teens flee to a military bunker, the birds follow. Eva finds a walkie talkie and gets in contact with park ranger Garrett ([[Lance Guest]]), asking for rescue. The group flees the fort as Porky is eaten alive. Garrett and Jacqueline head out to save the teenagers. After a successful escape, Derrick is attacked by a bird but escapes. The group continues north and discovers a house. They check the nearby shed, which is a meat locker.

Derrick's infection begins ravaging his body and Johnson plans to shoot him because he's a liability. Garret and Jacqueline pinpoint the teens' location, but can't reach them because the birds are outside. The group makes a run for the meat shed. Lola and Eva throw out some meat to catch the birds' attention but the birds aren't taking it; they like fresh meat. Derrick hobbles out and offers himself as bait to the birds. They attack and eat him alive. The group finally meets Garrett and Jacqueline and load into the car. The birds attack the car, and Garrett loses control, flipping the car over. Everyone takes shelter under a concrete tunnel. They return to the military bunker, which is leaking gas. They make a plan to blow up the birds using explosives. Johnson wants to be the bait to lure the birds in. As they all flee, Eva pauses, looking back sadly at Johnson, who says he'll make it. The birds block Johnson's escape route and he shoots the explosive, sending the building in flames. The group leaves, remembering Johnson.

==Reception==
''[[Blog Critics]]'' poked fun at Sci-Fi Channel movies in their review of the film when they wrote "the mutated strain of bird flu started because of mysterious mutant birds in that forest where all Sci-Fi Channel movies are filmed." They made note of a stereotype cast, poor dialog, and several flaws with "Sluggish pacing, downtime, countless continuity errors, and repetitive dialogue are to be expected for a movie shot with something that can’t even be considered a budget, but ''Flu Bird Horror'' takes this to the extreme".<ref name="BC">{{cite web|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/sci-fi-channel-original-review-flu/|title=Sci-Fi Channel Original Review: Flu Bird Horror|last=Paprocki|first=Matt|date=May 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Blog Critics]]|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>  ''Dread Central'' felt that the story concept was more plausible than that of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s 2006 airing of ''[[Fatal Contact: Bird Flu in America]]'', but noted that the virus aspect as used in the film made little sense, writing "everything wrong with the film can be traced back to the nonsensical script." They opined that the birds themselves were the stars of the film when they wrote "Those zombie buzzards are the true stars of Flu Bird Horror&nbsp;— both ghastly and goofy all at the same time".  While noting that casting was not optimum, they wrote "On the plus side, I can't complain about the acting. I can complain about the dialogue, but I can't complain about the actors themselves." In consideration of the film's weaknesses, they still found it worthwhile by their writing "almost miraculously, ''Flu Bird Horror'' remains fairly watchable and I honestly don't know how Scott and company pulled it off all things considered".<ref name="DC2">{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>  ''[[Monsters & Critics]]'' panned the acting, writing that it "ranges from horrible to maniacally over-the-top."  However, they granted the film was somewhat better than most bad horror films even though representative of what is being expected from the Sci-Fi Channel by writing "''Flu Birds'' is potentially some "nature on the rampage" goofball fun and a lot better than ''[[Ghouls]]'', but it’s still not a quality film.  Not that you’d be expecting one with Sci-Fi Channel emblazoned on the front".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/dvd/reviews/article_1434503.php|title=Flu Birds&nbsp;– DVD Review|publisher=[[Monsters & Critics]]|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref>  ''[[DVD Talk]]'' panned the film as "fairly bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, even by creature feature standards", concluding that the "characters are completely uninteresting and the ending is underwhelming and disappointing".<ref name="DVDT">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34772/flu-birds/?___rd=1|title=revie Flu Birds |last=Felix|first=Justin|publisher=[[DVD Talk]]|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>
