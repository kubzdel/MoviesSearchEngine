'''''Babysitter Wanted''''' is a 2008 American [[horror film]] directed by Jonas Barnes & [[Michael Manasseri]] being written by Jonas Barnes.

==Plot==
A new life is starting for Angie, who’s leaving the embrace of her religious mother for college studies. She applies for a babysitting job after realizing she will need to find a job to support herself in college. She finds herself on a remote farm with the Stanton (Bruce Thomas and Kristen Dalton) family and their adorable little boy, Sam. However, Angie’s first night of work might just be her last.

Alone in the vast and sprawling house, anonymous phone calls begin to shatter her peace of mind. The calls soon turn into a face to face confrontation with a hulking beast of a man who breaks through the front door. Angie must fight for her life to protect herself and Sam. She then realizes that Sam is a born child of the devil, and the man who broke in was a priest that discovered the family's horrible secret. Sam's mother and father return home and they reveal they are just as evil, concealing their possessed child's secret with a hat to hide his horns and feeding him babysitters they reel in, and Angie is one of the babysitters.

They hold Angie hostage, and she manages to fight back for a while. When the police arrive, Angie, with the help of an officer, kills the mother and father. Sam appears, kills the officer, and chases Angie into the barn where she seemingly defeats him as well. Angie wakes up in a hospital and the police inform her they did not find a little boy, much to Angie's horror. It is then shown that Sam is alive, now with another family, with the mother putting up flyers for a needed babysitter.
