== Plot summary ==
College student Beth Stratman (Constance Medrano) decides to travel to the small town of Bridgeport to do some additional research for a paper about local folklore. There are many stories about the old abandoned hospital there. The police think it is full of drug dealers and prostitutes. The locals think it is full of ghosts.

Unfortunately, they are both wrong. Beth instead finds Stanley Creech (Daniel Emery Taylor) who introduces himself as the caretaker of the grounds. She soon finds that Stanley is a psychopath, necrophile, and serial rapist. He holds her for several days, repeatedly raping and torturing her, leaving her no apparent means of escape.

Meanwhile, a group of hapless paranormal investigators, led by the goofs Alan ([[Jim O'Rear]]) and Jack (Jason Crowe), descend upon the property to document the alleged supernatural activity. This puts the group on a collision course with Stanley since he will do anything to keep his secret from being known. Girls begin to disappear in the night and the group learns that there is more to the story than originally thought. Both Stanley and the ghosts are just the beginning.
