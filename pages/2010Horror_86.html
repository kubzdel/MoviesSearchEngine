'''''Insidious''''' is a 2010 American-Canadian [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[James Wan]], written by [[Leigh Whannell]], and starring [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]], and [[Barbara Hershey]]. It is the first installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the third in terms of the series' in-story chronology. The story centers on a couple whose son inexplicably enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an [[astral plane|astral dimension]] who want to inhabit his body. The film was released in theaters on April 1, 2011, and was [[FilmDistrict]]'s first [[theatrical release]]. The film is followed by a sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2|Chapter 2]]'' (2013) and two prequels, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3|Chapter 3]]'' (2015) and ''[[Insidious: The Last Key|The Last Key]]'' (2018).

==Plot==
Married couple Josh and Renai Lambert, their children Dalton, Foster, and infant daughter Cali have recently moved into a new home.  One night, Dalton is drawn to the attic when he hears creaking noises and sees the door open by itself.  He falls from a ladder while investigating and sees a figure in the shadows.  Hearing his terrified screams, Renai and Josh rush to his aid.  The next day, Dalton falls into an inexplicable coma.

After three months of treatment without result, Renai and Josh are allowed to take Dalton home.  Soon after, paranormal activity begins to occur; Renai begins hearing voices over the [[baby monitor]] when no one is in Cali's room.  Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night, Renai sees a frightening figure of a man in Cali's room, who vanishes when Josh comes and the burglar alarm is repeatedly triggered for no reason.  After Renai finds a bloody hand print on Dalton's bed, she questions Josh about the house, but he ignores her.  That night, Renai is attacked by the figure from Cali's room, and the Lamberts decide to abandon the house and move elsewhere.

In the new house, Renai sees the ghost of a dancing boy who leads her to Dalton's room.  Josh's mother, Lorraine, visits them one day, and says she had a dream in which a figure in Dalton's room replies "Dalton" when she asks what it wants.  At the same time, she sees a monstrous red-faced demon standing behind Josh and screams, while Dalton's room is ransacked and Dalton himself is found lying on the floor.
 
Lorraine calls [[demonologist]]s Elise Reiner, Specs, and Tucker.  Elise senses a presence in the house and upon entering Dalton's room sees something on the ceiling.  Specs draws the demonic, red-faced figure Lorraine saw.

Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to travel mentally to the [[astral plane]], and had been doing so in his sleep, believing his abilities to merely be dreams.  He had traveled too far and became lost in a purgatory realm called "The Further", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead.  Without his mental presence, Dalton's body appears comatose and spirits can use it to enter the physical world.  Josh is skeptical until he realizes that drawings in Dalton's bedroom hinted at his astral projection abilities and the same red-faced demon Lorraine had seen.

Elise performs a seance to communicate with Dalton, but they contact the demon who uses Dalton's body to attack them until it is stopped by Elise.  Elise reveals that her acquaintance with Lorraine is decades old, because she previously performed the same service on Josh when he was eight years old.  Josh was terrorized by the parasitic spirit of an old woman.  Lorraine dismissed his nightmares until the spirit showed up in her photos of Josh, progressively getting closer each time.  Josh also possesses the ability to astral project, though he [[Memory inhibition|had suppressed his memory]] of the ability years prior with Elise's help.  Dalton has inherited this trait from him.  Elise tells Josh that the only way to rescue Dalton is for him to go into the Further.

Elise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project himself to their previous house.  He goes to the attic, but is attacked by the same figure that attacked Renai.  After defeating him, Josh enters the Demon's lair, where Josh finds Dalton chained to the floor.  Josh frees him, but they are caught by the demon while the spirits of the Further invade the real world and terrorize Elise, Renai, and the others.  After managing to escape, Josh confronts the old woman that haunted him as a child.  The old woman dissolves into darkness after Josh shouts at it to leave him alone.  When Josh and Dalton return to their bodies, they wake up in their new home and the spirits seem to disappear.

As they celebrate the apparent end of their ordeal, Elise starts packing her equipment with Josh, when she senses that something is wrong, noticing Josh's hands look old and dirty, she takes a photo of him.  Josh, enraged by this, strangles Elise to death.  Renai is horrified when she discovers Elise's dead body and searches for Josh.  Renai picks up the camera and sees that the image Elise took of Josh is the old woman that haunted him as a child, implying that Josh has been possessed.  Josh suddenly puts his hand on her shoulder, says "''Renai, I'm here''",  and she turns around and gasps.

==Production==
The movie was somewhat of a reaction of Wan's to the success of the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' series.<ref name="EWProd">{{cite web|last1=Collis|first1=Clark|title=Director James Wan talks 'The Conjuring' and 'Insidious 2' and confirms we'll be seeing more of [spoiler] in 'Fast & Furious 7'|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/06/20/fast-and-furious-7-conjuring-insidious-2-james-wan|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=18 February 2016}}</ref> Wan directed the first ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' film in 2004, and while he stated in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that he was "very proud" of the movie, he also felt that the movie, specifically, the violence and gore of it, put some people off and made them hesitant to work with him.<ref name="EWProd"/> Wan thus made ''Insidious'' in part to prove that he could make a movie without the level of violence found in the ''Saw'' series.<ref name="EWProd"/>

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Insidious'' was completed over the course of three weeks in 2010, from late April to mid-May at the historic [[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Herald Examiner Building]] in downtown Los Angeles.<ref name="STYD">{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive Set Report: James Wan Talks Insidious|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/15227-exclusive-set-report-james-wan-talks-insidious|publisher=[[Crave Online]]|work=Shock Till You Drop|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=May 18, 2010}}</ref> In regards to the shorter shooting schedule, actor [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] explained, "We had long days and a lot of pages a day, and we didn’t get a lot of coverage or rehearsal. But luckily, the benefit of doing a movie that’s not on a big budget—and the reason it’s usually done like that—is so if the filmmakers feel like, ‘OK, we’re not going to sacrifice anything on screen,’ which I don’t think they have, it lets them have complete control. So we were in good hands."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gingold|first=Michael|title="INSIDIOUS": Raising Fear|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/moviestv/fearful-features/4026-insidious-raising-fear|work=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 1, 2011}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Music===
The musical score to ''Insidious'' was composed by [[Joseph Bishara]], who also appears in the film as the demon.<ref name="STYD" /> Performed with a quartet and a piano, a bulk of the score was improvised and structured in the editing process, although some recording sessions began prior to filming.<ref>{{cite web|last=Comerford|first=Jason|title=Insidious by Joseph Bishara|url=http://www.howlinwolfrecords.com/13chills/2011/13chills2011_8_insidious.html|work=Howlin' Wolf Records|accessdate=June 6, 2013|year=2011}}</ref> On describing the approach of the film's soundtrack, director James Wan explained, "We wanted a lot of the scare sequences to play really silent. But, what I like to do with the soundtrack is set you on edge with a really loud, sort of like, atonal scratchy violin score, mixing with some really weird piano bangs and take that away and all of a sudden, you’re like, 'What just happened there?'"<ref>{{cite web|last=Messer|first=Ron|title=James Wan & Leigh Whannell INSIDIOUS Interview; The SAW Creators Also Discuss Their Untitled Sci-Fi Project, NIGHTFALL, and Recent Horror Remakes|url=http://collider.com/james-wan-leigh-whannell-interview-insidious/|work=Collider.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013|date=April 4, 2011}}</ref>

On a budget of $1.5 million, it has since grossed a total of US$54 million in the US and $43 million internationally, for a total of $97 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=Insidious|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=insidious.htm|work=Box Office Mojo|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=Box Office Mojo}}</ref> ''Insidious'' was one of the most profitable films of 2011 (with ''[[Cars 2]]'' having a worldwide profit of $362 million).<ref>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2011&p=.htm</ref>

===Critical response===
Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 66% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 164 reviews; the average score is 6/10. The critical consensus is: "Aside from a shaky final act, ''Insidious'' is a very scary and very fun haunted house thrill ride."<ref>{{cite web|title=Insidious (2011)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insidious/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Flixster, Inc|accessdate=1 August 2012|author=Rotten Tomatoes by Flixster|year=2011}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of 4 and said, "It depends on characters, atmosphere, sneaky happenings and mounting dread. This one is not terrifically good, but moviegoers will get what they're expecting."<ref name="rebert">{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110331/REVIEWS/110339994/0/people|title=Insidious|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=March 31, 2011 |work=Chicago Sun-Times|via=rogerebert.com|accessdate=26 May 2011}}</ref>

A number of negative reviews reported that the second half of the film did not match the development of the first. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "the strongest analogue for the second half of ''Insidious'' is one that the filmmakers probably weren’t trying for: it feels like a less poetic version of an [[M. Night Shyamalan]] fairy tale."<ref>{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Hale|title=Movie Review – Insidious|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/movies/insidious-directed-by-james-wan-review.html?partner=rss&emc=rss|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-03-31|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref> Similarly, [[James Berardinelli]] commented, "[i]f there's a complaint to be made about ''Insidious'', it's that the film's second half is unable to live up to the impossibly high standards set by the first half."<ref>{{Cite web|author=James Berardinelli|title=Insidious|url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2281|work=Reelviews.net|date=2011-04-02|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref> Ethan Gilsdorf of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote that "[t]he film begins with promise" but "[t]he crazy train of ''Insidious'' runs fully off the rails when the filmmakers go logical and some of the strange gets explained away as a double shot of demonic possession and astral projection."<ref>{{Cite news|author=Ethan Gilsdorf|title=Insidious|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-01/ae/29371417_1_rose-byrne-red-door-lin-shaye|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2011-04-01|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>

Positive reviews have focused on the filmmakers' ability to build suspense. John Anderson of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' explains "[w]hat makes a movie scary isn't what jumps out of the closet. It's what might jump out of the closet. The blood, the gore and the noise of so many fright films miss the horrifying point: Movie watchers are far more convinced, instinctively, that what we don't know will most assuredly hurt us... ''Insidious'' establishes that these folks can make a film that operates on an entirely different level, sans gore, or obvious gimmicks. And make flesh crawl."<ref>{{Cite journal|author=John Anderson|title='Insidious': Scary Eyeful of the Unknown|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703806304576234622228157638?mod=WSJ_ArtsEnt_LifestyleArtEnt_2|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=2011-04-01|accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref> Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: "director James Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell admire all sorts of fright, from the blatant to the insidiously subtle.
