'''''The Invasion''''' is a 2007 American [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]], with additional scenes written by [[The Wachowskis]] and directed by [[James McTeigue]], and starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Daniel Craig]]. Its plot follows a [[Washington, D.C.]] psychiatrist (Kidman) who finds those around her turning into emotionless beings shortly after a major space shuttle crash.

''The Invasion'' is the fourth [[film adaptation]] of the 1955 novel ''[[The Body Snatchers]]'' by [[Jack Finney]], following [[Don Siegel]]'s 1956 film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'',  [[Philip Kaufman]]'s 1978 remake ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', and [[Abel Ferrara]]'s 1993 ''[[Body Snatchers (1993 film)|Body Snatchers]].''

==Plot==
After the [[space shuttle]] ''Patriot'' crashes on Earth, a fungus-like alien lifeform is discovered on the remaining parts scattered over U.S. territory. Once people come into contact with the organism, they are controlled by it when they enter [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. One of the first people infected is Tucker Kaufman, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] director investigating the crash.

Tucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell, begins to feel something is amiss when people seem to have "changed". Her patient Wendy Lenk describes how her husband "is not her husband", and one of her son's friends acts detached and emotionless. At a neighborhood [[Halloween]] party, Carol's son Oliver finds a "skin" on a partier which is initially believed to be costume makeup. Carol speculates that the skin may be an organism connected to reports of a fast-spreading flu. Carol takes the organism to her doctor friend Ben Driscoll to have it checked. Carol attends a friendly dinner meeting between Russian diplomat Yorish and Czechoslovakian diplomat Belicec (along with female companion Luddie) and discusses her [[postmodern feminism]] views over caviar and champagne. Meanwhile, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu vaccine.

Ben and Dr. Stephen Galeano, a biologist, discover how the spore takes over the brain during REM sleep. During this investigation, Luddie calls Ben, worried about Yorish's behavior. Driscoll and Galeano also find that people who had brain-affecting illnesses, such as [[encephalitis]] or [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis|ADEM]], are immune to the spore because their previous illnesses prevents the spore from "latching on" to the brain matter. Carol's son, Oliver, is immune to the spore because of the ADEM he had as a young child. Carol decides to get her son, who might show a way to a cure, back from Tucker. Before she drives to Tucker's house, she joins Ben's team who is called to the house of the Belicecs, the Czech ambassador and his wife, in a case of emergency. There they witness the transformation of Yorish, the Russian ambassador and the Belicecs' friend.

When Carol arrives at Tucker's house, he and several colleagues close in on her. He explains that the changed humans, devoid of irrational emotions, are offering a better world, and asks her to join them. When Carol resists, he holds her to the ground and infects her by spurting his saliva on her. She escapes and returns to Ben at the Belicecs' house. They flee when Belicec returns with more transformed people intent on infecting anyone in the house. Galaneo and one of his assistants head to a base outside Baltimore where they and other scientists attempt to find a cure for the alien virus. Carol and Ben separate to find Oliver, who texts his location, the apartment of Tucker's mother, to Carol.

Finally, Ben arrives, but Carol realizes that he too has become one of the infected. He successfully seduces her to give in to the new society, but also frankly states that there is no room for people like Oliver who are immune. Carol shoots Ben in the leg and flees with Oliver.  She is picked up by helicopter and flies to the center preparing the inoculations. In time, the alien virus is reversed and society reverts to its violent ways.

==Production==
===Conception===
In March 2004, [[Warner Bros.]] hired screenwriter David Kajganich to write a script that would serve as a remake of the 1956 science fiction film ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Cathy Dunkley |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117902307.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Scribe warms to WB's 'Body' |work=Variety |date=March 25, 2004 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> In July 2005, director [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]] was attached to helm the project, with production to begin in [[Edgemere, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=10400 |title=''Body Snatchers'' Get a Director |publisher=''ComingSoon.net'' |date=July 15, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> The following August, Nicole Kidman was cast to star in the film then titled ''Invasion'', receiving a salary of close to $17&nbsp;million. ''Invasion'' was based on the script by Kajganich, originally intended as a remake of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'', but Kajganich crafted a different enough story for the studio to see the project as an original conception.<ref name="unearths">{{cite news |author=  Fleming, Michael |author2=  Brodesser, Claude |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117926842.html?categoryid=1236&cs=1 |title=WB unearths 'Invasion' |work=Variety |date=August 1, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> Kajganich described the story to reflect contemporary times, saying, "You just have to look around our world today to see that power inspires nothing more than the desire to retain it and to eliminate anything that threatens it." The screenwriter said that the story was set in Washington, D.C. to reflect the theme.<ref>{{cite news |author=Cheong, Felix |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/299761/1/.html |title=Remaking the Remake |work=''[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]]'' |date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=October 5, 2007}}</ref> In August, Daniel Craig was cast opposite Kidman in the lead.<ref name="plans">{{cite news |author=  McClintock, Pamela |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117927747.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Craig plans for 'Invasion' |work=Variety |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref> The film, whose original title ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' was shortened to ''Invasion'' due to Kajganich's different concept, was changed once more to ''The Visiting'' so it would not be confused with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s TV series ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=  McClintock, Pamela |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117930411.html?categoryid=1019&cs=1 |title='Invasion' title snatched |work=Variety |date=October 9, 2005 |accessdate=April 28, 2007}}</ref>

In May 2007, composer [[John Ottman]] recorded the musical score for ''The Invasion'', using heavy synthesizers combined with a 77-piece orchestra intended to create "otherworldly foreboding and tension".  The music was also designed to have an [[avant-garde]] [[postmodern music|postmodern]] style, with atmospheric and thrilling action elements.<ref>{{cite news |author=Dan Goldwasser |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=992 |title=John Ottman scores ''The Invasion'' |publisher=SoundtrackNet |date=May 25, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2007}}</ref>

[[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the film, writing: "The latest and lamest version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers might have been an accidental camp classic if its politics weren't so abhorrent and the movie didn't try to hide its ineptitude behind a veil of pomposity."<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|author=[[Manohla Dargis|Dargis, Manohla]]|date=August 17, 2007|accessdate=May 3, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/movies/17inva.html|title=Review - The Invasion}}</ref> Paul Arendt of the [[BBC]] wrote: "Having established an effectively creepy mood in the first half, the film eventually degenerates into a muddled mess, with Nicole and Daniel Craig dodging zombies while popping amphetamines in a desperate effort to stay awake.
