[[Dread Central]] gave the film a rating of 3.5/5 stars, writing "With a fantastic-looking presentation and even better instances of gratuitous violence, the movie treads back to the fun days of cut-em-up flicks, and Aguiar looks as if he paid some serious attention to detail with the crafting on this one."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Laughing Mask, The (2015)|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/143494/the-laughing-mask-2015/|website = Dread Central|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave The Laughing Mask three out of five skulls, saying "in spite of the minor technical missteps and the editing shortcomings, ''The Laughing Mask'' definitely deserves attention for the inventive melding of classic slashers and cop drama, as well as some brutal and inventive kills."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Torfe|first1=Pat|title=[Review] Inventive Brutality with Cop Drama Hides Behind ‘The Laughing Mask’|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3375092/review-inventive-brutality-with-cop-drama-hides-behind-the-laughing-mask/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref>
