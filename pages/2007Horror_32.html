'''''Boogeyman 2''''' is a 2007 American [[supernatural horror film]] edited and directed by [[Jeff Betancourt]] and the [[sequel]] to the 2005 film ''[[Boogeyman (film)|Boogeyman]]''. The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars [[Danielle Savre]], [[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]], [[Tobin Bell]] and [[Renee O'Connor]]. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]], and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one.

Due to the previous film's financial success, ''Boogeyman 2'' was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] at the former hospital, [[Linda Vista Community Hospital]], over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.

After screening at the [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] on October 20, 2007, ''Boogeyman 2'' was released [[direct-to-video]] in the United States on January 8, 2008; it was later released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to be a general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary [[Creature Features|creature features]], including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, ''[[Boogeyman 3]]'', the following year.

==Plot==
As young children Laura Porter and her brother Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a hooded man, whom they believe to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: [[Nyctophobia|nyctophobic]] Mark, [[Germaphobia|germaphobic]] Paul, [[Self-harm|masochistic]] Alison, [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a [[bulimic]] girl who fears extreme weight gain.

Upon her joining, however, the members of the group are targeted and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.

Dr. Ryan goes to the basement to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother and those of other patients with bogyphobia ([[phobia]] of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is [[Hallucination|hallucinating]]. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.

Laura finds Nicky on a basement table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; along the way she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt to treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is framed for the murders and arrested.

In a [[post-credits scene]], the Boogeyman looks at a picture of Laura and Henry as adults before disappearing.

''Boogeyman 2'' was first announced in October 2006 due to the financial success of its predecessor with [[Jeff Betancourt]], [[film editing|film editor]] of ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', ''[[When a Stranger Calls (2006 film)|When a Stranger Calls]]'' and ''[[The Grudge 2]],'' making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/boogeyman-2-is-creeping-up-on-us/ |title=Boogeyman 2 is creeping up on us |date=October 11, 2017 |work=[[GamesRadar]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |accessdate=March 27, 2017 }}</ref> The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Betancourt wakes up 'The Boogeyman'|url=http://productionweekly.com/2006/10/09/betancourt-wakes-up-the-boogeyman/|website=Production Weekly|accessdate=March 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121184238/http://productionweekly.com/2006/10/09/betancourt-wakes-up-the-boogeyman/|archivedate=November 21, 2006|date=October 9, 2006}}</ref> It was produced by [[Ghost House Pictures]], a film production company created by [[Sam Raimi]] and [[Robert Tapert]] which specializes in creating horror films.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chapman King|first1=Lynnea|title=The Coen Brothers Encyclopedia|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0810885778|page=160}}</ref> Betancourt stated that he wanted to avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the creature in the film.

The film was criticized for having an unoriginal story and unlikable characters. Brandon Ciampaglia of [[IGN]] described it as "yet another stupid horror film" and gave it a score of 4/10.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ciampaglia |first1=Brandon |title=DVD Screamers, Vol. 8 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/03/dvd-screamers-vol-8 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[j2 Global]] |accessdate=March 18, 2017 |date=January 3, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106105404/http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/03/dvd-screamers-vol-8 |archivedate=January 6, 2017 |df= }}</ref> Ryan Turek of [[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]] criticized the story, characters, and lack of suspense, but found the film more entertaining than the original, with better acting than it deserved.

Positive reviews praised the film for presenting a more realistic approach to the Boogeyman and eschewing CGI, both of which were considered improvements over its predecessor. Its death scenes were highly praised for being extremely violent and gory. Many reviewers also recognized that the film exceeded their expectations despite its direct-to-video status and low budget. Shawn Lealos of ''[[CHUD.com]]'' gave the film a score of 6.8 out of ten, stating that it was "a very solid little horror flick that forgoes the ridiculous CGI and hokum supernatural aspects of the first movie, as well as the restraints of PG-13."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lealos |first1=Shawn S. |title=DVD Review: Boogeyman 2 |url=http://www.chud.com/13662/dvd-review-boogeyman-2/ |website=[[CHUD.com]] |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |date=February 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518083315/http://www.chud.com/13662/dvd-review-boogeyman-2/ |archivedate=May 18, 2017 |df= }}</ref> In a similar review, Matthew Stern of ''[[PopMatters]]'' praised the film in comparison to its predecessor, giving it eight stars out of ten, with a consensus reading: "A film that bucks the stigma of direct-to-DVD sequels, this unyieldingly dark and bloody feature will surprise you, especially if you were unfortunate enough to catch the first one."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stern |first1=Matthew A. |title=Boogeyman 2 |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/boogeyman-2/ |website=[[PopMatters]] |accessdate=March 27, 2017 |date=January 22, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106102447/http://www.popmatters.com/review/boogeyman-2/ |archivedate=January 6, 2017 |df= }}</ref> David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also praised ''Boogeyman 2'' over the first film, particularly for its "satisfying kill sequences" and an entertaining supporting cast.
