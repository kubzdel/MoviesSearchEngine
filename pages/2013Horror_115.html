==Plot==
Beckett (Sophie Curtis) is a young teenager mourning the loss of her mother. She's moved to the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] with her father Miles ([[Linus Roache]]) and is set to begin school at Hamilton, an exclusive [[University-preparatory school|prep school]]. Beckett is so engrossed in her grief that she fails to notice that her school is a little stranger than most schools, as its students are prone to suicides and is full of extraordinarily beautiful female teachers. Things grow worse when the school nurse Pamela ([[Kelly Reilly]]) decides to move in with Beckett and Miles, especially since Pamela keeps instructing Beckett to remain a virgin. What Beckett doesn't know is that Pamela and the other school staff are all incarnations of [[Lamia]], a former queen of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], and must kill and drink the blood of virgins to retain their immortal existence.
