'''''Saw VI''''' is a 2009 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Kevin Greutert]] from a screenplay written by [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]]. It is the sixth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]] and stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Peter Outerbridge]], and [[Shawnee Smith]]. It was produced by [[Mark Burg]] and [[Oren Koules]] of [[Twisted Pictures]] and distributed by [[Lionsgate]].

''Saw VI'' continues the franchise's focus on the posthumous effects of the [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw Killer]] and the progression of his successor, [[Mark Hoffman]]. In this film, Hoffman sets a series of traps for an insurance executive, [[List of Saw characters#William Easton|William Easton]], and his employees. Meanwhile, the FBI trails [[List of Saw characters#Peter Strahm|Peter Strahm]], now suspected of being Jigsaw's last accomplice, and Hoffman is drawn into motion to protect his secret identity.

Greutert, who served as editor for all the previous ''Saw'' films, made his directorial debut with ''Saw VI''. Melton and Dunstan, the writers for both ''[[Saw IV]]'' and ''[[Saw V]]'', returned to write the screenplay and [[Charlie Clouser]], who provided the score for all previous ''Saw'' films, composed the [[Saw VI: Original Motion Picture Score|score]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from March to May 2009 with a budget of $11 million.

The film was released in New Zealand and Australia on October 22, 2009, and in the United States and Canada on October 23, 2009. In Spain it was the first film to receive a [[Motion picture rating system#Spain|Película X]] rating for violence (a rating usually reserved for [[pornographic film]]s); the rating restricted screenings to eight select theaters in that country. It was released almost a year later on October 8, 2010 in Spain with an "18" rating, after the producers had the offensive content edited out, according to the rating board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2010/08/04/spain_drops_xrating_on_saw_vi|title=Spain Drops X-Rating On 'Saw VI'|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate= May 18, 2015}}</ref> With gross receipts of $14 million in its opening weekend, ''Saw VI'' placed second to ''[[Paranormal Activity]]''{{'s}} $21 million. ''Saw VI'' went on to gross over $68 million worldwide, the lowest-grossing ''Saw'' film to date, but still a financial success compared to its small budget. Reviews were mixed, with some criticizing the acting and others praising Greutert's directing and the film's contribution to the [[Healthcare reform debate in the United States|debate on healthcare reform in the United States]].

==Plot==
Two [[Predatory lending|predatory lenders]] wake up in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and the one who sets more flesh weight on their scale will survive. The overweight Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the game's footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called over by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who found Peter Strahm's fingerprints at the scene. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed the autopsies for all of the Jigsaw victims thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddie's flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahm's involvement.

While at the hospital to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and tells her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof that his methods work. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.

William Easton, an insurance executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the company's attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned [[zoo]], where he and his janitor, Hank, awaken in [[vise]]s designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into [[oxygen mask]]s strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath and is killed by the vise. William's other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a [[hanging]] room, a [[steam room]], and [[carousel]] trap. Flashbacks show that John met William at the opening of Jill's clinic and took issue with his formula for only deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, John's coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.

The game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room, which contains a tank of [[hydrofluoric acid]] and a switch marked "Live" and "Die". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahm's fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahm's death. The moment his voice is unscrambled, Hoffman kills everyone in the room, with Perez mockingly telling him that everyone already knows of his involvement before she dies. He then plants fingerprints using Strahm's severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.

He returns to the observation room and finds the letter he had written to Amanda, in which he had used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches the end of his path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch to "Die" and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope from John's will, which contains ''his'' photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand to free his wrist restraints and jams the trap in window bars as it activates. He then pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek in the process and screams in agony.

On July 26, 2007, before ''[[Saw IV]]'' was released, [[CraveOnline]]'s horror website ShockTilYouDrop.com announced that [[Costas Mandylor]] would sign-on to appear as [[Mark Hoffman]] in ''[[Saw V]]'' and ''Saw VI''.<ref name="Costas Return">{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=889 |title=Actor Signs For More Saws |last=Rotten |first=Ryan |work=ShockTilYouDrop |publisher=CraveOnline Media |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=March 24, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5n3mfgsIZ?url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=889 |archivedate=January 26, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Mandylor commented on his character: "Hoffman is sort of torn of becoming a mad man or becoming a guy that's more composed, coming from a pure place like Jigsaw.

On March 24, 2009, it was confirmedthat [[Shawnee Smith]] would return as [[Amanda Young]].

This was compared to ''Saw IV'' and ''Saw V'', which most of the traps were set in big rooms and involved several people at one time.<ref name="B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew"/>

Armstrong told [[Bloody Disgusting]] reviewer Mike Pereira that he thinks "visually" ''Saw VI'' might be his favorite, saying "We're kind of pulling back a little bit in the color palette. It's going to be more suggestive and not so vibrant, in your face like ''III'' and ''IV''. It's more neutral and shows natural flesh tones. On ''Saw V'', I pulled back a little bit and on this one, I pulled back even more."<ref name="B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew"/> He commented that the "steam room" trap was the "best looking" of them all.  He went on to say, "It's big and expensive. It's got furnaces, fires and steam. It's multi-leveled. The most complex ''Saw''. We had techno cranes flying through. It was pretty amazing."<ref name="B-D Chats With the Cast and Crew"/> Commenting on the "carousel room" trap Armstrong said: "It's very carnival, playground-like. It's just nasty. [There are] spinning red lights in there. It's really overwhelming to walk in and look at because everything is spinning." Greutert said in an issue of the horror magazine ''[[Fangoria]]'' that the "carousel room" was, to date, the "longest trap scene ever". He admitted that originally they had ten actors riding the carousel, but it was ultimately scaled down to six, to "tie in to the [film's] title".<ref>{{harv|Alexander|2009|p=41}}</ref> [[Post-production]] services were provided by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|Deluxe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lionsgatepublicity.com/epk/saw6/docs/pro_notes.doc|title=Saw VI Production Notes|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]|format=[[DOC (computing)|.DOC]] file 3.23MB download|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that "''Saw VI'' is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the ''Saw'' films. It's the first one that's more or less consumed by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." He said, "If your goal is to do a quick study for a round of ''Saw'' [[Trivial Pursuit]], then this may be the movie for you.

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said, "If this is torture porn, it's as if it was designed to be enjoyed by [[Michael Moore]]."  He closed his review saying, "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various [[Rube Goldberg]]-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/saw-vi-film-review-93699 |title=Saw VI – Film Review |last=Scheck |first=Frank |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=October 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61jQpk10a?url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/saw-vi-film-review-93699 |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Roger Moore of ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' gave the film two out of five stars.

[[Wesley Morris]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film a two and half out of four stars saying, "Who knew that the franchise's creators would eventually find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value?
