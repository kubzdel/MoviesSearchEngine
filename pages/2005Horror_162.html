'''''Silent Scream''''' (originally known as '''''The Retreat''''') is an independent, horror film directed by Matt Cantu and Lance Kawas and starring [[Scott Vickaryous]], [[Melissa Schuman]] and [[Shanti Lowry]].

== Synopsis ==

A group of college students head out to a cottage in the woods for a long weekend vacation. No sooner have they arrived that several of the teens wander off into the woods and disappear. More students arrive the next day. They find the mutilated remains of their friends buried in the snow. It seems someone in the woods is out to get them. The remaining teens try to escape, but one by one, the mysterious "figure" hunts them down and kills them.

== The Figure ==
The Figure is a [[slasher film|slasher]]-type character who stalks the teens before they even arrive at the cottage. His fighting skills, resilience and sheer brutality put him on par with other slashers like [[Jason Voorhees]] and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]]. Once they arrive at the cottage, the Figure begins killing off the teens in the most gruesome and brutal ways. For a short time, the teens suspect that one of them may be the Figure, but all their theories are eventually disproven.

The Figure is a strong fighter, and extremely resilient. He seems to be stronger than all of the teens. He also seems impossible to kill. Throughout the movie, he is shot, stabbed, beaten with a stick, and hit by a truck, and he just keeps coming back in perfect health. In addition, he's very resourceful. He sets up traps in the woods and uses guns, axes, knives, tools, chains and even wire hangers to butcher the teens.

The Figure is played by Tobiasz Daszkiewicz, Thomas Zellen, Bob Brown and Randy Bergeron.
