It stars [[Sarah Lassez]] and Dustin Fasching as a young couple that must deal with supernatural along with their own personal demons.

Betz was inspired to make the film after he and his girlfriend had both been "creatively dead for quite some time" and he'd woken one night to hear her making strange noises while she slept.<ref name=dc>{{cite web|title=Shriekfest 2011: Exclusive Q&A with Filmmaker Travis Betz: The Dead Inside|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47637/shriekfest-2011-exclusive-qa-filmmaker-travis-betz-dead-inside#axzz30oOcdMN2|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> This prompted him to come up with the idea for ''The Dead Inside'' and he chose to make it a musical after watching Sarah Lassez perform at a [[karaoke bar]].<ref name=dc />

==Synopsis==
Fi ([[Sarah Lassez]]) and Wes (Dustin Fasching) are deeply in love, but they find themselves forced to take unfulfilling jobs in order to make ends meet. Wes would rather take pictures of things that interest him, but has to work as a [[Wedding photography|wedding photographer]]. Fi has been suffering from [[writer's block]] and her steady job as the author of ''The Dead Survive'', a series of zombie-themed books, isn't helping her creative juices flow. Their tenuous existence is further threatened when Fi begins to develop signs of [[schizophrenia]] that are revealed to be possibly demonic in nature.
