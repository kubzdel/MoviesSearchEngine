==Plot==
Lieutenant Brian Murphy (Freeman), a [[United States Air Force]] engineer, is the sole survivor of the final evacuation plane out of Africa, which crashes somewhere off the coast of [[West Africa]]. The previous night, a zombie horde attacked many villages throughout that area. Brian gathers supplies from the plane crash and travels by foot until he finds and fixes a broken-down truck in a village he reaches. While driving, the truck gets stuck in a pothole as zombies close in. Daniel Dembele (Osei), a local African soldier gone [[AWOL]] in search of his son, rescues Brian from certain death. Daniel's wife had been killed in a zombie attack the previous night and a local military unit, heading north to a military base, had rescued his son. Daniel agrees to lead Brian to the nearest airport, a day's drive away, in exchange for his truck upon arrival for Daniel to use to find his son. At the airport, Brian attempts radioing for help using the air traffic tower's radio, but he receives no response. Daniel gathers fuel for the truck and the two agree it would be best to stick together and attempt travel to the military base, with Daniel hoping his son is there and Brian hoping they have a plane he can repair to fly back to the United States.

They rest for a night at a village that has been converted to a survival colony safeguarded by a group of local soldiers. They leave the following morning. While driving through the African plains, the truck hits a tree, breaking the axle and disabling the vehicle. Brian and Daniel continue on foot and sleep around a fire that night. A zombie horde attacks the group in their sleep, leaving Daniel bitten and badly wounded. They manage to shoot their way out of the attack and continue moving forward. Daniel tells Brian of a necklace he wears and that he planned to pass down to his son. Daniel succumbs to his wounds soon thereafter. Brian continues the trek alone to the northern military base. After an arduous journey through dangerous and rough terrain, Brian reaches the base, which has become a survival colony. He repairs an old radio unit in the base and broadcasts his name, managing to reach fellow American military officer Frank Greaves at a U.S. military base in [[Henderson, Nevada]]. It is revealed that the epidemic has reached the United States, which is rapidly failing to hold out. When Brian asks about his family, Frank informs him that "they're gone." Zombies invade the U.S. military base, ending the radio transmission. Brian goes back outside as zombies overwhelm the gates around the colony and begin killing all the survivors. At the last moment, Daniel's son approaches Brian, seeing his father's necklace in his hand. They hold hands and turn to face the overwhelming horde that approaches them.The film ends leaving their fate unknown.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
The production encountered many problems, and rather than shooting in the planned six weeks, the crew actually ending up taking 12 weeks. A delay in the shipping of the equipment to Africa initially added three weeks to the schedule; other notable problems included the lead actor Rob Freeman contracting [[malaria]] and almost dying in the middle of filming. He was taken to the local hospital and put on an [[IV drip]] for several days. Another delay was caused by considerable damage to camera equipment.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Shooting took place in [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Ghana]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000–2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=56–57|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref> Post-production was done in Brighton, London and Elstree in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].{{cn|date=November 2016}} The film sound mix was completed by Bafta nominated Adam and Graham Daniel shortly before Christmas 2010.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Howard J.
