'''''Vampire''''' is a 2011 dramatic horror-thriller film that was directed and written by [[Shunji Iwai]].

==Synopsis==
Simon ([[Kevin Zegers]]) is a seemingly ordinary biology teacher that spends much of his spare time caring for his [[Alzheimers|Alzheimers-ridden]] mother Helga ([[Amanda Plummer]]). This ends up not being the case, as Simon believes himself to be a vampire and spends much of his time looking at online sites for suicidal women who would make for easy prey. One such woman, Jellyfish ([[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]), is tricked into believing that she and Simon will both be killing one another, only for Simon to drink her blood after he administers sleeping pills and draws blood from her. Along with his vampiric hobby, Simon tries to keep his mother indoors by putting her in a [[straitjacket|straitjacket-esque]] contraption tied to several large balloons. It is when Simon meets Laura ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]) that things begin to unravel, as she grows obsessed with him to the point where she breaks into his home. Things begin to further devolve when Renfield ([[Trevor Morgan (actor)|Trevor Morgan]]), a man who also believes himself to be a vampire, emerges onto the scene and is far more violent than Simon ever dared to be.

==Production==
Iwai was inspired to create ''Vampire'' after he "got the idea about a serial killer who was more like a friend to his victims" and liked the question of "if the victims are working with the killer in helping kill themselves, would it be considered murder or aided suicide?".<ref name=SDANCE>{{cite web|last=Hanson|first=Jeff|title=Q&A: Vampire|url=https://www.sundance.org/festival/article/qa-vampire/|publisher=Sundance|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=IW>{{cite web|title=Meet the 2011 Sundance Filmmakers : "Vampire" Director Iwai Shunji|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/meet_the_2011_sundance_filmmakers_vampire_director_iwai_shunji|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> While further developing the idea for ''Vampire'' Iwai wanted to "strip away the romantic idea behind vampirism", but also wanted to explore the idea of a vampire that is "not a supernatural creature but rather a real human being".<ref name=BD>{{cite web|last=Eggersten|first=Chris|title=Sundance '11 Interview: 'Vampire' Director Iwai Shunji|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/23270/sundance-11-interview-vampire-director-iwai-shunji/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> He based the character of Simon partially on "the strange habits that we all have" and stated that if he had not come up with the idea of Simon, he would have likely passed on ''Vampire's'' theme.<ref name=BD /> Iwai penned the script for ''Vampire'' himself. However, as Iwai had difficulty with spoken English dialogue, asked the performers to "not follow the script too closely and try to be more spontaneous so that the dialogue would be natural."<ref name=BD />

Actor Kevin Zegers was asked to perform in the film after Iwai met Zegers while dining with friends.<ref name=TF>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Todd|title=Twitch Visits The Set Of Shunji Iwai's VAMPIRE|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2010/05/twitch-visits-the-set-of-shunji-iwais-vampire.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref> Zegers immediately accepted and was one of the first actors brought in.<ref name=TF /> Filming for ''Vampire'' took place in [[Vancouver, Canada]] during spring of 2010, and Zegers later stated that the process was very taxing due to the film's nature.<ref name=TF /> Iwai confirmed this, saying that the weather was "always gray and rainy, which can bring the mood down" and that he "gave a lot of freedom to Kevin with his character, Simon, so he really took on the sadness and troubles Simon’s character was going through."<ref name=BD />
