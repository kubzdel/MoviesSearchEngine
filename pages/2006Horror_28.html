Robert Beveridge of Popcorn for Breakfast: "All the SFCOM markers are here. There’s bad CGI, awful script, generic cute chicks (and one who’s supposed to be the “plain” intelligent one who’s actually hotter than the rest of the bunch: in this movie, that’s Kiratikorn Ratkulthorn, in her first but hopefully not last film), monsters that do nothing you’d think they would do, etc.<ref>https://vareverta.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/boa-nguu-yak-boa-the-huge-snake2006-a-worse-big-snake-movie-than-amayo-uzo-phillips-yes/</ref>
