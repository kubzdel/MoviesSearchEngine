'''''House of 1000 Corpses''''' is a 2003 American [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] [[horror film]] written, co-scored and directed by [[Rob Zombie]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film stars [[Sid Haig]], [[Bill Moseley]], [[Sheri Moon Zombie|Sheri Moon]]<!--At the time of filming, she was yet to be married and is billed as simply "Sheri Moon" in the credits.-->, and [[Karen Black]] as members of the Firefly family. Set on [[Halloween]], the film sees the Firefly family torturing and mutilating a group of teenagers who are traveling across the country writing a book. The film explores a number of genres, and features elements of the [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]]. Zombie cited American horror films ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' (1977) as influences on ''House of 1000 Corpses'', as well as other films released during the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012031522/http://www.ifc.com/videos/house-of-1000-corpses |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |work=IFC (The Independent Film Channel) |title=House of 1000 Corpses |accessdate=2012-07-08 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Initially filmed in 2000, ''House of 1000 Corpses'' was purchased by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], thus a large portion of it was filmed on the [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios backlots]]. The film was made with a budget of $7 million. Zombie worked with [[Scott Humphrey]] on the [[Film score|score of the film]]. ''House of 1000 Corpses'' featured a graphic amount of blood and gore, and controversial scenes involving [[masturbation]] and [[necrophilia]]. The project was ultimately shelved by the company prior to its release due to fears of an [[NC-17]] rating.<ref name="fangoria">{{cite journal|work=Fangoria|issue=199|pages=20–25|title=Death to False Horror|author=Szulkin, David}}</ref> Zombie later managed to re-purchase the rights to the work, eventually selling it to [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]. The film received a theatrical release on April 11, 2003, nearly three years after filming had concluded.

Among film critics, ''House of 1000 Corpses'' received a generally negative reaction following its release. The film was critically panned, with the film's various side-plots and main cast being criticized by multiple critics.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|work=Film Threat|title=House of 1000 Corpses review|accessdate=2013-10-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309234847/http://www.filmthreat.com/Reviews.asp?Id=4247|archivedate=March 9, 2005|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film earned over $3 million in its opening weekend, and would later go on to gross over $16 million worldwide. Despite its initial negative reception, the film went on to develop a cult following. Zombie later directed the film's [[sequel]], ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' (2005), in which the Firefly family are on the run from the police. Zombie later developed a haunted house attraction for Universal Studios Hollywood based on the film. This would be the final film performance of [[Dennis Fimple]], before his death in August 2002. The film was dedicated to his memory.

==Plot==
On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station; however, the owner, Captain Spaulding and his friend Stucky begin mocking the robbers, and Stucky identifies Wick and begins taunting him with his nickname. Karl decides to kill them both, but is attacked by Spaulding's assistant, Ravelli, allowing Spaulding to kill them. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of "The Museum of Monsters & Madmen", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts in what is later seen to be a trap and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.

There they meet Baby's family: Mother Firefly, Otis Driftwood, her adopted brother, Grampa Hugo and Baby's deformed giant half-brother, Tiny. While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house after he suffered a psychotic break. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As they leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack the couples in the drive way and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.

When Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a tortured victim in the trunk. Don, who was once a cop, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the neck and kills him, and Don and Steve are then killed by Otis upon finding other bodies in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits, and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is stabbed to death by Baby moments later. One of the family members dons the uniform of one of the deputies and drives their car, while drunk.

Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]]. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Earl, Mother Firefly's ex-husband, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the backseat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table.

[[Rob Zombie]] rose to fame as a member of the band [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], before later beginning a solo career.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lecaro |first=Lina |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2010/11/shes_in_the_band-_white_zombie.php |title=Interview: White Zombie's Sean Yseult Awakens Sleeping Corpses With New Book – Los Angeles – Music – West Coast Sound |publisher=Blogs.laweekly.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-22}}</ref> Zombie's debut album, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]'' (1998), drew influence from classic horror films, as did his music videos for "[[Living Dead Girl (song)|Living Dead Girl]]" (1999) and "[[Superbeast]]" (1999).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Rob+Zombie/Hellbilly+Deluxe |title=Hellbilly Deluxe – Rob Zombie – Listen and discover music at |publisher=Last.fm |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumink.com/index.php/articles/permalink/rob_zombie/ |title=Maximum Ink music magazine of Wisconsin &#124; Artist Interviews &#124; Rob Zombie |publisher=Maximumink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/08/heavy-metal-and-horror |title=Heavy Metal and Horror – IFC |publisher=Ifc.com |date=2012-08-14 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}</ref> The album was a commercial success, selling over three million copies in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - August 07, 2015|work=riaa.com}}</ref> Prior to working on ''House of 1000 Corpses'', Zombie had done animation for ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'' (1996), directed music videos, and attempted to write a script for ''[[The Crow: Salvation]]'' to no avail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428859/zombie-will-write-direct-next-crow-flick.jhtml |title=Zombie Will Write/Direct Next "Crow" Flick – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=''MTV'' |date=1997-02-11 |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref> In 1999, Zombie designed a haunted maze attraction for [[Universal Studios]]. The project was a success, and was seen as instrumental in reviving the studios annual [[Halloween Horror Nights]]. Bill Moseley presented Zombie an award for his contribution that same year, while Zombie formed a friendship with the company.<ref name="fangoria" /> The studio later began working on an animated [[Frankenstein]] film which Zombie hoped to be a part of, though plans for the film were ultimately scrapped by the studio.<ref name=cdinterview>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandivine.com/RobZombie.htm|title=Rob Zombie - Christian Divine|publisher=Christiandivine.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>

The idea for ''House of 1000 Corpses'' came to Zombie while designing a haunted house attraction for the studio titled "The House of 1000 Corpses".<ref name=cdinterview /> This gave Zombie the initial idea for the film, which he later pitched to Universal to a positive reception.<ref name=cdinterview /> Zombie later stated "I was in the office of the head of production or something and he asked me if I had any movie ideas and I pitched him Corpses, which was very rough at the time, because I wasn't ready and I made it up on the spot. He liked it, I went home, wrote a 12-page treatment and met up with them. Two months later, we were shooting."<ref name=theguardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/19/popandrock|title=Interview: Rob Zombie|publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Production on the film began in May 2000.<ref name="fangoria" /> Zombie stated that the film was finished by Halloween of 2000.<ref name=cdinterview /> The house was launched the following year, though the title was changed to "American Nightmare" due to the shelving of the film.<ref name=cdinterview /> Despite the name change, the house still featured numerous references to the film, and the theatrical trailer played while customers waited.<ref name=cdinterview />

The starting budget of the film was $3–4 million, though the film's final budget is debatable.<ref name="fangoria" /> Zombie at one point claimed that the film was made solely with the initial $4 million, though in a later interview claimed the film had received a budget of anywhere between $7–14 million.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVffEFtxKhM|title=Rob Zombie explains why House of 1000 Corpses cost so much to make.|date=28 February 2014|work=YouTube}}</ref> Zombie later admitted that he initially knew he didn't have the funding for a good ending but hedged his bets that if he shot what he could on what remained of his budget, the studio would kick in more funds to make a better ending. "I knew the ending sucked, so I let it suck and they said, "The movie's great but the ending sucks" and I know. So they gave me more money and we shot a more elaborate ending, bigger sets, the whole razzamatazz."<ref name=cdinterview /> The original film featured more characters, with Zombie mentioning a "skunk ape thing", and featured footage of the four teenagers on their road trip.<ref name=slasherama>{{cite web|url=http://www.slasherama.com/features/robzombie.HTML|title=Slasherama Interviews Rob Zombie|publisher=slasherama.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> Universal hoped that the film would focus more on the group of kids, with Zombie stating "nobody gives a shit about the kids".<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie claimed the film was not initially meant to feature elements of [[black humor]], claiming it "turned out a little wackier and campier than I originally intended. But as we were shooting, that's the tone that it was turning out to be. Movies sometimes dictate their own course, so I just sort of went with it."<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/rob-zombie-13946|title=avclub Interviews Rob Zombie!|publisher=avclub.com |accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref>

The film was shot on a twenty-five-day shooting schedule. Two weeks were spent filming on the Universal Studios Hollywood backlots — the house featured in the film is the same house used in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (film)|The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' (1982), and can be seen on Universal Studios' tram tours.<ref name="fangoria" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudiotour.com/ush/backlot/chickenranch.shtml|work=The Studio Tour: Universal Studios Hollywood|title=The Chicken Ranch|accessdate=2012-07-08}}</ref> Zombie stated that filming on the lot was at times difficult, as the amusement park would often be open and would ruin takes.<ref name=cdinterview /> The remaining eleven days of the shoot were spent on a ranch in [[Valencia, California]].<ref name="fangoria" /> The scene involving Bill being transformed into "Fishboy" was initially much longer, featuring gory details of the creation of the monster.<ref name=slasherama /> Zombie stated the scene was created after Universal passed on the film.<ref name=slasherama /> Scenes featuring Baby masturbating with a skeleton, along with other cutaway scenes, were filmed in Zombie's basement after initial filming for the project had concluded. Zombie later cited home recordings from the [[Charles Manson|Manson family]] as inspiration for the Firefly family's "bizarre" rants. Zombie often filmed two versions of scenes, one of which would be less gory, in an attempt to please Universal.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Jake McKinnon could not see well when dressed as The Professor, and almost hit actress Erin Daniels with a real ax during the film's climax. Zombie later claimed he simply hoped Daniels would move out of the way in time. When Denise calls her father from a telephone booth, a sign for a missing dog head can be seen hanging in the booth; this was in fact a real item found by Zombie and used for the film. In the early stages of the film, Grandpa Hugo was to be revealed as the murderous Dr. Satan, who at the time was simply referred to as the mad doctor. The legend of the mad doctor was to be a ploy by the Firefly family to lure victims in, though this idea was later scrapped. This led to Grandpa Hugo receiving much less screen-time. The character of Dr. Satan was inspired by a 1950s billboard-sized poster advertising a "live spook show starring a magician called Dr. Satan" that Zombie has in his house.<ref>{{Citation | last = Ulmer | first = Gary | title = Interview with the Zombie | periodical = Dark Realms Magazine | pages = 14–16 | volume = issue 11 | date = Summer 2003 | url = http://www.monolithgraphics.com/darkrealms.html}}</ref>

The film's main cast consisted of the murderous Firefly family, the four teenagers and various police officers attempting to find the group, among others.<ref name="horrorhound">{{citation|last =Newell|first =Eric|title=House of 1000 Corpses|journal=Horror Hound|volume=1|issue=36|pages=26–33| year= 2012}}</ref> Sid Haig was cast as Captain Spaulding, a man who dresses as a clown and owns a gas station and museum of curiosities.<ref name="horrorhound"/> Haig claimed he had to "get in touch with [his] own insanity" for the role.<ref name=aboutfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutfilm.com/features/devilsrejects/castinterviews.htm|title=Devil's Rejects - Cast Interviews|accessdate=2015-01-31}}</ref> His relation to the Firefly family is not revealed in the film, though he is working with them to some extent; however, the sequel establishes that he is the father of Baby. Bill Moseley starred as Otis B. Driftwood, who was adopted into the Firefly family. Sheri Moon Zombie portrayed Baby Firefly, who became known for her high pitched laugh and sexual nature.<ref name=slasherama /> Karen Black was cast as Mother Firefly, the protective mother to the family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/rob-zombie-fan-help-house-of-1000-corpses-karen-black-cancer-battle/|title=Rob Zombie Rallies Fans to Help ‘House of 1000 Corpses’ Actress Karen Black’s Cancer Battle|work=Loudwire}}</ref> [[Matthew McGrory]] portrayed Tiny Firefly, a tall man who was left deformed after a house fire started by his father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-08-10-mcgrory-obit_x.htm|title=Matthew McGrory Obit|accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> [[Robert Allen Mukes]] portrayed Rufus "RJ" Firefly.

The names members of the Firefly family were taken from the names of [[Groucho Marx]] characters. Captain Spaulding was a character in ''[[Animal Crackers (1930 film)|Animal Crackers]]'' (1930), Otis B. Driftwood was a character in ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935), Rufus T. Firefly was taken from ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933), and lastly Hugo Z. Hackenbush derived from ''[[A Day at the Races (film)|A Day at the Races]]'' (1937). Despite only allusions to this being made in ''House of 1000 Corpses'', it is more prevalent in the film's sequel, with the names becoming integral to the plot.<ref name="ifc.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2013/07/five-surprising-facts-about-rob-zombies-house-of-1000-corpses|title=Five Fun Facts About Rob Zombie’s House of 1000 Corpses|work=www.ifc.com}}</ref> Zombie acknowledged that viewers were meant to "root for" the Firefly family as opposed to the group of teens, though claims it wasn't intentional: "Yeah, I wanted the audience to cheer 'em. I didn't consciously think of it at the time, because I was trying to make Bill and Jerry likeable. But it's like when you saw ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and you could tell all [[Tim Burton]] cared about was Beetlejuice."<ref name=slasherama />

[[Erin Daniels]] portrayed Denise Willis. [[Chris Hardwick]] was cast as Jerry Goldsmith, a young man who was seen as "hyper" and "wise-cracking".<ref name="ifc.com"/> The character Bill Hudley was portrayed by [[Rainn Wilson]]. ''House of 1000 Corpses'' served as one of Wilson's first films, though he would later go on to find mainstream success following the film's release.<ref>{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |authorlink= |title=Rainn Wilson |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1597537,00.html|quote=Did being of the Baha'i faith help you understand the spirituality?

Mary was seen as the most confrontational of the group, often clashing with Baby due to her flirtatious relationship with Bill. [[Harrison Young]] was selected to play Don Willis, the father of Denise who later goes looking for her and her group of friends. [[Tom Towles]] and [[Walton Goggins]] portrayed Lieutenant George Wydell and Deputy Steve Naish, respectively; the pair work with Don to find the missing group.<ref name="horrorhound"/>

===Music===
{{main|House of 1000 Corpses (soundtrack)}}
The [[Film score|score for the film]] was composed by Zombie, alongside Canadian producer [[Scott Humphrey]]. Much of the production work for the soundtrack to the film was done in Humphrey's studio, The Chop Shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/ |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28}}</ref><ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |title=The Chop Shop |publisher=The Chop Shop |date= |accessdate=2012-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426065635/http://www.thechopshop.com/about.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The film's score featured similar musical themes to Zombie's releases, consisting of heavy metal influences. [[MTV]] said the music mixed "snippets of ominous hillbilly dialogue with grim horror movie rock."<ref name=MTVmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1469829/rob-zombie-prepping-new-lp-movie-builds-brick-house-with-lionel-richie/|title=Rob Zombie Prepping New LP, Movie; Builds ‘Brick House’ With Lionel Richie|date=February 7, 2003}}</ref> While making the movie, Zombie joked with his manager that he should do a cover of "[[Brick House (song)|Brick House]]" (1977), originally performed by [[Commodores]]. His manager later got both [[Lionel Richie]] and female rapper [[Trina]] to appear on a cover of the song with Zombie, under the title "Brick House 2003".<ref name=MTVmusic /> Aside from making audio clips and snippets for the film, Zombie recorded a variety of new songs for the film's soundtrack. The song "[[House of 1000 Corpses (song)|House of 1000 Corpses]]", taken from Zombie's album ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]'' (2001), is also present.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r633897|pure_url=yes}}|title=House of 1000 Corpses - Original Soundtrack|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The soundtrack, released on March 25, 2003, made an appearance on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the United States. The soundtrack to the film is isolated on home video releases of the film as a separate audio track.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Release==
Prior to agreeing to release the film through Universal, Zombie reportedly told the studio of the film's nature, stating "I was really blatant when I talked to them. I didn't want to get into a situation where they thought I was making something mainstream. And I told them that I wanted to make a drive-in movie, something very gritty and nasty and weird."<ref name=avclub /> Production of the film was completed in 2000, and was set for release through Universal. The studio completed a theatrical trailer for the film, which was shown in theaters and prior to the Universal ride created by Zombie.<ref name=avclub /> Zombie later received a call for a meeting with Stacey Snider, head of Universal, requesting a meeting. Zombie recalled fearing that the studio would demand a re-shoot, though he later learned that Snider's fears of the film receiving an [[NC-17 rating]] had led to the company's refusal to release the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.axs.com/news/rob-zombie-announces-new-movie-3i-rocking-dead-10999|title=Rob Zombie announces new movie ‘3I’: Rocking dead|date=May 18, 2014}}</ref> The film remained shelved for several months, with Zombie eventually purchasing the rights to the film from Universal. Zombie claimed that many urged him to scrap the film following the fallout with Universal, though he continued to search for a new distributor.

==Reception==
[[File:Cannes 2014 Texas Chain Saw Massacre 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Critics noted the influence of the [[Tobe Hooper]] (above) film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974).]]
''House of 1000 Corpses'' received a generally negative critical reception upon its release. Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote that the film "lives up to the spirit but not the quality of its inspirations" and is ultimately a "cheesy and ultragory exploitation horror flick" and "strangely devoid of thrills, shocks or horror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/frank-scheck/?cats=&genreid=&letter=&switches=&sortby=&limit=50&page=18|work=RottenTomatoes, Hollywood Reporter|author=Scheck, Frank|title=Frank Scheck Movie Reviews|date=2003-04-14|accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref> Clint Morris of ''[[Film Threat]]'' slammed the film as "an hour and a half of undecipherable plot" and found the film to be "sickening" overall.<ref name="auto"/> James Brundage of [[Filmcritic.com]] wrote that the film was simply "hick after hick, cheap scary image after cheap scary image, lots of southern accents and [[psychosis|psychotic]] murders," and was "too highbrow to be a good cheap horror movie, too lowbrow to be [[satire]], and too boring to bear the value of the ticket."<ref>[http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument House of 1000 Corpses Movie Review, DVD Release – Filmcritic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012100506/http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/2a460f93626cd4678625624c007f2b46/5da244ef271690fb88256d0900187b41?OpenDocument |date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the film two out of four stars, stating "If not for the blink-and-miss sideshow attractions and stockpile of memorable quotes, ''[House of] 1000 Corpses'' would have been easier to shrug off. This vintage curio is proudly and humorously derivative but that familiar aftertaste is that of wasted opportunities."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/house-of-1000-corpses|title=Film Review: House of 1000 Corpses|publisher=Slant Magazine|date=March 28, 2003}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' also had a negative review of the film, writing "As much as film buffs might enjoy recognizing references to ''[[Motel Hell]]'' and other drive-in classics, Mr. Zombie's encyclopedic approach to the genre results in a crowded, frenzied film in which no single idea is developed to a satisfying payoff." <ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B00E0D8143BF931A25757C0A9659C8B63|title=Movie Review - House of 1000 Corpses|publisher=New York Times|date=April 12, 2003}}</ref> The review also criticized the cutaway scenes and home footage used throughout the film, adding "Mr. Zombie is both too much of a stylist, always cutting away to oddball inserts, black-and-white flashbacks, negative images and much else, and too little: he is not in enough control of his means to let a mood grow and fester. And festering is what this kind of film is all about."<ref name=nyt />

''[[JoBlo.com]]'' had a more positive view of the film, claiming it "slaps together just the right amount of creepy atmosphere, nervous laughter, cheap scares, fun rides and blood and guts to satisfy any major fan of the macabre."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/reviews-2010.php?mode=joblo_movies&id=87|work=JoBlo.Com|author=Garabedian, Berge|date=2003-04-07|accessdate=2013-09-28|title=Review: House of 1000 Corpses}}</ref> Horror Express gave the film a generally positive review, claiming "He has succeeded for the most part, but really this is only a film Rob Zombie could do. Beyond the harkening back to the old days, there are instances where Zombie's signature style comes through. It's a style he has honed over the years through his videos, animations and music. Grotesque imagery is shown through skewed camera angles as grinning faces watch on. A use of bright fluorescents almost creates a deceptive atmosphere of childlike innocence as the devils perfect their craft on screen."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorexpress.com/moviereview/house-of-1000-corpses|title=HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES Movie Review|work=horrorexpress.com}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a C+, saying "''House of 1000 Corpses'' "isn’t coherent, exactly, but what dripping-ghoul horror movie is these days?

Zombie, who displays a natural flair for the cinematic, has a real appreciation and knowledge of horror pictures and a [[Diane Arbus]]-like affinity for sleazy, bizarre Americana and schlock culture. Throughout his fast-moving movie he inserts vintage clips in a witty, telling manner, and as to be expected, Zombie, with Scott Humphries, has come through with a rip-roaring score for his picture."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/14/entertainment/et-thomas14|title=Demented glory or wretched excess?|publisher=LA Times|date=April 14, 2003}}</ref> The film has a 19% "rotten" rating on film review website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on eighty reviews, saying "There's an abundance of gore in this derivative horror movie, but little sense or wit."<ref>{{cite web|title=House of 1000 Corpses - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_1000_corpses/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref> It has a [[Metacritic]] score of 31, signifying "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/house-of-1000-corpses|title=Metacritic House of 1000 Corpses|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref>

But viewed less a movie and more as an experience, the film offers a certain degree of inspired insanity and a healthy dose of carnival-like madness".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/01/house-of-1000-corpses-blu-ray-review|title=House of 1000 Corpses Blu-Ray Review|publisher=IGN|date=October 1, 2007}}</ref> Zombie has acknowledged the film's cult status, stating "Now, a decade later, it's become a pretty loved movie among people. It's great that we have this big celebration. I love seeing Sid Haig and the other actors get such great attention from it. The funny thing is, ten years becomes a long time. I'll meet someone who's eighteen-years-old, and that's always been a film that they've loved. It's funny that the film's been around that long to be like that for some people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/rob-zombie-ventures-back-to-house-of-1-000-corpses-talks-madness-in-halloween-2/7638083|title=Rob Zombie Ventures Back to "House of 1,000 Corpses" Talks Madness in "Halloween 2"|work=ARTISTdirect}}</ref> CinemaBlend also wrote of the film's cult status, stating "While his ''[[Halloween (film series)|Halloween]]'' films were a mess, Zombie did bring something new with his original films ''House of 1000 Corpses'' and ''The Devil's Rejects'', developing a cult following for his movies on top of the one he earned for his music.
