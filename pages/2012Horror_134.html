==Reception==
HorrorNews.net gave ''Sleeper'' a favorable review, writing that "Even though ''Sleeper'' sounds like films most of us have seen hundreds of times it still finds a way to knock its viewer on their head. The film simply flows and there isn’t really any slow moments, Resnick gets free and proceeds to tear through the town."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Film Review: Sleeper (2012)|url = http://horrornews.net/53632/film-review-sleeper-2012/|website = Horrornews.net|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US}}</ref>

''28 Days Later Analysis'' wrote "the story is a violent one, but one of better film elements within Sleeper are the many diverse settings",<ref name="28 Days Later Analysis" /> and also noted the "ending is a little vague, but the many action scenes make up for some of the deficiencies." They scored the film 7 out of 10, concluding "the story is not fleshed enough, a multi-dimensional villain, predictable".<ref name="28 Days Later Analysis" /><ref name="28 Days Later Analysis">{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=A Killer Awakes in Sleeper: A Movie Review|date=31 May 2012|publisher=28 Days Later Analysis|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

Of its release in Germany, ''Amboss-Mag'' reviewed ''Outback Revenge'' and noted [[Raven (wrestler)|Scott Levy]]'s showing himself as a supreb casting choice for the role of Resnick.  While most of the other cast were not entirely convincing, that point was less important because all they had to do was appear and "bite the dust", and though it barely prevented itself from looking low-budget, it was an entertaining action film.<ref name="Amboss-Mag">{{cite web|last1=staff|title=film review:''Outback Revenge''|url=http://magazin.amboss-mag.de/film-outback-revenge-action-revenge|date=24 November 2014|language=German|accessdate=4 January 2015|ref=Amboss-Mag}}</ref>
