'''''Valentine''''' is a 2001 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Jamie Blanks]], and starring [[Denise Richards]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Jessica Capshaw]], and [[Katherine Heigl]]. Loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage, the film follows a group of women in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] who are stalked by a man whom they tormented during their childhood.

Release theatrically in February 2001, the film received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its performances and cinematography, and others criticizing its conclusion and deeming it too redolent of 1980s horror films. In spite of the mixed critical response, the film was a box office success, earning a total of [[US dollar|USD]]$36.7 million.

==Plot==
At a [[junior high]] school [[St. Valentine's Day]] [[dance]] in 1988, Jeremy Melton, an outcast student, asks four popular girls to dance. The first three girls, Shelley, Lily, and Paige reject him coldly, while the fourth girl, Kate, politely responds "maybe later". Their overweight friend Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation and they proceed to secretly make out underneath the bleachers. When bully Joe Tulga and his friends discover them, Dorothy claims that Jeremy sexually assaulted her. Joe and his friends publicly strip and severely beat Jeremy, and his nose starts bleeding under the distress. Later, Jeremy is expelled and eventually transferred to a reform school.

Thirteen years later, in 2001, Shelley, now a medical student at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], is at the morgue one evening studying on for her medical exam. After receiving a vulgar Valentine's card in her locker, she is attacked by a man in a trench coat and [[Cupid]] mask. She is cornered in a cooler used to store cadavers, where she attempts to hide in a [[body bag]], but the killer finds her before slitting her throat. The killer's nose is seen to bleed as he performs the act.

At Shelley's funeral, Kate, Lily, Paige, and Dorothy are questioned. They admit to not having seen her in some time after she moved from [[San Francisco]] to [[Los Angeles]]. Kate and Paige receive cards in the same fashion as Shelley. Dorothy, who is now much thinner, receives a card which reads "Roses are red, Violets are blue, They'll need dental records to identify you". Her boyfriend, Campbell, loses his apartment and stays with her. Lily receives a box of chocolates and a card which says "You are what you eat". She then takes a bite of one of the chocolates, and vomits upon realizing that there are [[maggots]] inside of it.

As the girls attend the exhibit of Lily's artist boyfriend Max, they meet Campbell's bitter ex-girlfriend Ruthie, who accuses him of being a [[con artist]]. Lily is isolated at the art exhibit and confronted by the killer, who proceeds to shoot her repeatedly with arrows until she falls several floors into a dumpster. When they have not heard from Lily, the others assume she is in [[Los Angeles]] on a work trip. Upon contacting the police, they agree that the culprit could be Jeremy Melton. Dorothy admits to her friends that she lied, and that Jeremy never attacked her and she ruined his life by getting him beat up and sent to reform school. Meanwhile, Kate's neighbor breaks into Kate's apartment to steal her underwear and is murdered by the killer.

As Valentine's Day approaches, Dorothy is planning a [[party]] at her family's large estate. On the morning of the party, the killer murders Campbell with an axe in the basement. The others assume he has simply left Dorothy after dumping her, angering Dorothy, who believes that they are jealous and still look at her as the "fat girl" of the group. After coming to the party to confront Dorothy with the truth about Campbell, Ruthie is thrown through a shower window by the killer who then impales her neck on the glass. At the party, Paige is attacked and trapped in a hot tub by the killer, who proceeds to try and kill her with a drill. After cutting her, he opens the lid of the hot tub and throws the electric drill into the water, electrocuting her to death.

The party disintegrates when the power cuts out, and Dorothy and Kate argue over who the killer is. Kate claims that Campbell could be a suspect because they do not know anything about him, while Dorothy counters by accusing Adam, Kate's recovering alcoholic on-off boyfriend, who is now a journalist. After being told by Lily's boyfriend that she did not arrive in Los Angeles as planned, Kate realizes she is also probably dead, and calls the detective assigned to the case. After dialing the number, she follows the sound of a ring tone outside the house and discovers the detective's severed head in the pond.

Kate becomes convinced that Adam is actually Jeremy, disguised by reconstructive surgery, and goes back into the house, only to find Adam waiting for her. To her surprise, he asks her to dance, and they dance together for a while until she becomes frightened, kneeing him in the groin and escaping. She runs through the house, discovering the corpses of Paige and Ruthie. She locates a gun, but someone in the Cupid's mask jumps out and runs into Kate, resulting in knocking the gun from her hand and sending them both tumbling down a staircase. The supposed killer arises and is shot by Adam who appears at the top of the stairs using Kate's gun. As a shocked and confused Kate apologizes profusely, Adam pulls off the Cupid's mask to reveal the killer as Dorothy. Adam forgives Kate, explaining that childhood trauma can lead to lifelong anger and some people are eventually forced to act on that anger. As Kate and Adam wait for the police to arrive, they hug as Adam says he has always loved her. Moments later, as Kate closes her eyes as they wait for the police to arrive, his nose begins to bleed, indicating that he is Jeremy Melton after all.

===Critical reception===
''Valentine'' received largely negative reviews from critics. Mick LaSalle of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the film a middling review likening to a 1980s-style slasher film, but praised the performances, writing: "''Valentine'' isn't scary, but it is unsettling; not ultimately satisfying, but arresting in the moment. Part of the credit has to go to the ensemble. The actresses are vivid, and the characters they play are clearly delineated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/A-Not-So-Happy-Valentine-Day-Slasher-flick-2955967.php|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Mick|last=LaSalle|title=A Not-So-Happy 'Valentine' Day / Slasher flick has no heart|date=February 3, 2001|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}</ref> Ben Falk of [[BBC]] gave the film two out of five stars, writing: "Let's face it - we all know what's going to happen and director Blanks (''[[Urban Legend (film)|Urban Legend]]'') offers up few surprises. There's the host of red herrings of which none really bite, creative deaths, girls running around screaming and then being incredibly thick, but a distinct lack of gratuitous nudity, which would have at least brightened up the landscape."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/04/11/valentine_2001_review.shtml|work=BBC|title=Films - review - Valentine|first=Ben|last=Falk|date=April 13, 2001|accessdate=February 14, 2017}}</ref>

Kevin Thomas of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling the film a "smart, stylish horror picture that offers a fresh twist on the ever-reliable revenge theme and affords a raft of talented young actors solid roles that show them to advantage."<ref>{{cite news|work= Los Angeles Times|title=Stylish, Suspenseful Revenge in "Valentine"|first=Kevin|last=Thomas|date=February 3, 2001|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/03/entertainment/ca-20450|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, noting: "Looking good but lacking much in the way of personality or gray matter — rather like its characters — ''Valentine'' is a straightforward slasher pic that’s acceptably scary until a weak finale."<ref name=harvey>{{cite web|work=Variety|first=Dennis|last=Harvey|title=Valentine|date=February 1, 2001|accessdate=December 30, 2016|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/valentine-1200466975/}}</ref> [[Maitland McDonagh]] of ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film one out of five stars, calling the film "A throwback to the formulaic, holiday-themed stalk-and-slash pictures of the
early '80s — but why it took four writers to adapt Tom Savage's generic genre novel is thoroughly baffling."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=[[Maitland McDonagh|McDonagh, Maitland]]|title=Valentine Review|accessdate=15 October 2017|url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/valentine/review/135081/}} {{rating|1|5}}</ref>

At [[Rotten Tomatoes]], an internet review aggregator, the film received an approval rating of 8%, with the general consensus being that "''Valentine'' is basically a formulaic throwback to conventional pre-''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' slasher flicks. Critics say it doesn't offer enough suspense or scares to justify its addition to the genre."<ref>{{cite web | title = Valentine Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/valentine | accessdate = January 8, 2011}}</ref>

In a 2015 retrospective review, the online horror publication ''Icons of Fright'' published a retrospective review of the film, defending the spirit of the film and its thematic handling of the holiday's mythological aspects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iconsoffright.com/2015/02/12/in-defense-of-valentine-2001/|work=Icons of Fright|title=In Defense of ''Valentine'' (2001)|date=February 12, 2015|accessdate=February 15, 2017|first=B.J.|last=Colangelo}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
The musical score for ''Valentine'' was composed by [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]]. The soundtrack also includes the songs "Pushing Me Away" by [[Linkin Park]], "God of the Mind" by [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]], "Love Dump ([[Mephisto Odyssey]]'s Voodoo Mix)" by [[Static-X]], "[[Superbeast]] (Porno Holocaust Mix)" by [[Rob Zombie]], "Valentine's Day" by [[Marilyn Manson]], and "Opticon" by [[Orgy (band)|Orgy]]. This soundtrack compilation was lampooned in a sketch by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which humorously pointed out that many of the bands featured on it were not only unknown to a mass audience, but have oddly nonsensical names.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season 26: Episode 11: Music From The Motion Picture Valentine|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/00/00kvalentine.phtml|work=Saturday Night Live}}</ref>
