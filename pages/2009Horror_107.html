'''''The House of the Devil''''' is a 2009 American [[horror film]] written, directed, and edited by [[Ti West]], starring [[Jocelin Donahue]], [[Tom Noonan]], and [[Mary Woronov]].

The plot concerns a young college student who is hired as a babysitter at an isolated house and is soon caught up in bizarre and dangerous events as she fights for her life. 

The film combines elements of both the [[slasher film]] and [[haunted house]] subgenres while using the "[[Satanic ritual abuse#As a moral panic|satanic panic]]" of the 1980s as a central plot element. The film pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to horror films of the 1970s and 1980s, recreating the style of films of that era using filming techniques and similar technology to what was used then. The film's opening text claims that it is based upon true events, a technique used in some horror films, such as ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' and ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.

==Plot==
In the 1980s, college student Samantha Hughes ([[Jocelin Donahue]]) inspects a house she wishes to rent. Due to Samantha reminding her of her own daughter, landlady ([[Dee Wallace]]) forgoes a deposit in favor of one month's rent in advance. Samantha is struggling financially so takes on a babysitting job for Mr. Ulman ([[Tom Noonan]]) and his wife ([[Mary Woronov]]). Ulman asks to meet her but stands her up, later apologizing and offering to pay double the original salary. Samantha accepts and gets a ride to the remote mansion from her best friend, Megan ([[Greta Gerwig]]). At the house, Mr. Ulman pulls her aside and reveals that he does not have any children to be monitored; the babysitting job is to attend to his wife's ailing mother. Samantha balks but finally agrees when she is offered $400 for the job, a significant increase in her pay. Megan immediately leaves, citing Ulman's lies and peculiar behavior, but she reluctantly promises to pick up Samantha later. Before the Ulmans depart, Samantha speaks with Mrs. Ulman, who tells her they are from "the desert."

On the way home, Megan stops in her car to smoke a cigarette.  When her lighter will not work, a stranger ([[A.J. Bowen]]) suddenly appears out of nowhere, startling her, and lights her cigarette for her. When Megan reveals that she is not the babysitter hired by the Ulmans, she is abruptly shot and murdered by the stranger. After ordering a pizza, Samantha dances around the house while listening to her [[Walkman]], accidentally breaking a vase in the process. While cleaning up the mess, she discovers a cupboard filled with old family photographs. In one photograph a different family than the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo she and Megan saw upon pulling up to the house. An additionally peculiar detail is that the family in the photograph has a young son. This seems unlikely as the Volvo is a new car and Mr. Ulman stated that although they had a child he was now grown. 

Samantha, shaken by a number of issues at the house and being startled by the arrival of the pizza she ordered (by the same man that killed Megan), dials 911, but eventually manages to calm herself down. Drugs in the pizza eventually cause Samantha to pass out, just as she discovers activity behind a door leading to the third floor. When she comes to, she finds that she has been bound and gagged in the center of a [[Pentagram]]. As a [[lunar eclipse]] darkens the night sky, Mr. and Mrs. Ulman, along with the stranger, who is actually their son Victor, begin a bizarre ritual. Mother (Danielle Noe) is revealed to be a grotesque, witch-like figure. As part of the ritual she slices her arm and pours the blood into a goat skull. She uses the blood to draw occult symbols on Samantha's stomach and forehead, and forces Samantha to drink her blood from the skull. 

Samantha manages to escape halfway through the ritual, killing Mrs. Ulman and Victor, but horrific images begin appearing in her mind. Mr. Ulman chases her out of the house and through a nearby cemetery. There, he tells her she was chosen. Samantha threatens him with the gun used to kill Megan, but Ulman passively accepts his fate, claiming to be a messenger and gloating that she's too late. Instead of shooting him, she shoots herself in the head, to Ulman's horror. The scene cuts to a broadcast about the strange lunar eclipse the night before, which has confounded scientists due to its abrupt ending, as Samantha is revealed to be in a hospital bed, in bandages. A nurse walks in and pats the unconscious Samantha on the stomach, reassuring her that "You will be just fine. Both of you."

==Production==
The film was shot in [[Connecticut]]. Taking place in the 1980s, the film was made with [[16mm film]], giving it a [[retro]] stylistic look that matched the decade.<ref>Zimmerman, Sam. [http://www.fangoria.com/blogs/terrifyingly-gnarly/4475-terrifyingly-gnarly-18--house-of-the-devils-aj-bowen.html "Terrifyingly Gnarly #18 – HOUSE OF THE DEVIL’s A.J. BOWEN"]. ''[[Fangoria]]''. October 28, 2009.</ref> Similarly, some aspects of the culture of the 1980s (i.e. [[feathered hair]], Samantha's 1980 Sony [[Walkman]], [[The Fixx]]'s 1983 song "[[One Thing Leads to Another]]", [[The Greg Kihn Band]]'s 1981 song "[[The Breakup Song (They Don't Write 'Em)]]", and the [[Volvo 240]] sedan) are seen in the film as signifiers of the decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35342/new-viral-ad-the-house-devil-looking-a-babysitter|title=New Viral Ad: The House of the Devil -- Looking for a Babysitter|publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> The cinematography of the film also reflects the methods used by directors of the time. For instance, West often has the camera zoom in on characters (rather than [[Tracking shot|dolly in]] as is now common in film), a technique that was often used in horror films of the 1970s and continued to be used into the 1980s.<ref>Tobias, Scott. "[http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-house-of-the-devil,38546/ The New Cult Canon: The House of the Devil]". ''The AV Club''. February 25, 2010.</ref> Other stylistic signifiers include [[opening credits]] (which became less common in films in the decades after the 1980s) in yellow font accompanied by [[Freeze frame shot|freeze-frames]] and the [[closing credits]] being played over a still image of the final scene.

The United States premiere was at the 2009 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in [[New York City]] on April 25. It was made available through [[video on demand]] on October 1, 2009.

==Reception==
The film received a score of 86% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 83 reviews; the site's reviews' consensus is "Though its underlying themes are familiar, ''House of the Devil'' effectively sheds the loud and gory cliches of contemporary horror to deliver a tense, slowly building throwback to the fright flicks of decades past."<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/house_of_the_devil/ "The House of the Devil"].
