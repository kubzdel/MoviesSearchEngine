==Plot==
''Elfie Hopkins'' tells the story of twenty-two-year-old slacker (Jaime Winstone), a "wanna-be" detective, set in a sleepy hunting village.  She is a stoner and an animal lover, and haunted by the death of her mother and surrounded by her broken father and alcoholic step-mother, Elfie seeks solace and inspiration from the old school detectives in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. She entertains herself, along with her geeky best friend, Dylan ([[Aneurin Barnard]]), by investigating the villagers and upsetting everyone with their imaginative allegations. Elfie's mundane existence is thrown for a spin with the arrival of a family of trendy city dwellers, the Gammons.

The Gammons weave tales of adventure and seduce the villagers with offers of exotic hunting holidays around the world.  It is not long before the villagers are flying off to the four corners of the world. Elfie, despite her best efforts, is not free to the Gammons' charms, but soon smells a rat.  Elfie and Dylan begin investigating the Gammons' life. Bloody violence and pandemonium soon starts to rage in the village and it is no longer just the blood of animals. Elfie discovers the villagers are not making those flights and when she finally uncovers the truth, it is darker than she could have ever imagined.

==Production==
Director Ryan Andrews became friends with Winstone when he was part of the camera crew for ''Daddy's Girl'', an independent Welsh film made in 2006, which also starring Winstone as a teen with a twisted lust for blood. Extending their shared love of fantasy, horror and anything grunge-related, Elfie Hopkins is, says Andrews, "a combination of an eclectic mix of British twee and American grunge – a weird mash-up of two worlds with a heightened comic-strip feel."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-winstones--bring-your-daughter-to-the-slaughter-2244939.html|title=The Winstones – Bring your daughter to the slaughter|accessdate=20 February 2012 | location=London|work=The Independent|date=18 March 2011}}</ref>

The film is based on short film by Andrews called The Gammons and it was this concept that Andrews, with co-writer Riyad Barmania, turned into a feature film script. "The Elfie character played a minor role in the short," explains Andrews. "But after meeting Jaime I knew she could become the main focus and make it something really special and unique in British horror fantasy terms. Elfie is a finely tuned representation of my own childhood memories growing up in rural Wales. I often used to imagine myself as a vampire hunter let loose on a community of surreal country folk. Riyad and I have taken those already magnified experiences and transformed them further... and the film is informed by everything between author Roald Dahl and The Lost Boys to Brit photographer Tim Walker."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/18539-exclusive-first-images-set-report-from-elfie-hopkins|title=Exclusive: First Images, Set Report from Elfie Hopkins!|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref>

Winstone says: "Ryan and I have been looking forward to making this film for years since our styles just collided and we really hit it off. It feels the right time to capture that 1990s vibe now."

"Elfie Hopkins has been an alter ego of mine for a while now," Winstone says, "and I can't wait for the world to meet her. She'll kick ass! For me, Elfie's a dream role to play, and I feel there is a gap in the British film industry which we will more than fill! I can't wait to work with Ryan Andrews—he is a young and exciting director with a vision that can match my imagination."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3478:meet-the-winstones-in-cannibalism-flick&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=167|title=Meet the Winstones in cannibalism flick|accessdate=20 February 2012}}</ref>
