==Synopsis==
The film follows Joey (Chuck Pappas), as he travels to meet his long-distance girlfriend of two years, Jennifer (Jessica Cameron). He believes that she is cheating on him and decides to film his trip down to her home in an attempt to elicit guilt from Jennifer over her presumed unfaithfulness. Joey manages to persuade his cousin Steven (James Cullen Bressack) and their friend Martin (Jody Barton) to join him on the trip, which turns into a [[car trip]] after Joey has a mental breakdown on a plane and puts them on the [[No Fly List]]. As the trio travels closer to their destination, Steven begins to grow leery of Joey's increasingly fragile mental state. This is further compounded by Joey's mother also showing concern over Joey during their [[Skype]] sessions, especially as he had never mentioned Jennifer to her before.
