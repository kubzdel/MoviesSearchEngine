'''''Lake Mungo''''' is a 2008 low budget [[Australia]]n [[psychological horror]] film directed by Joel Anderson and starring [[Talia Zucker]] and Martin Sharpe.  It employs a [[mockumentary]] format using actors in place of interviewees to tell the story of a family trying to come terms with the drowning death of their daughter and the potentially supernatural events they experience after her death.  The film received critical acclaim during its limited release.

==Plot==
Sixteen-year-old Alice Palmer drowns while swimming with her family at a dam in [[Ararat, Australia|Ararat]], [[Australia]]. Following the tragedy, her teenaged brother Matthew sets up video cameras around the house to record what seem to be images of Alice's ghost appearing in the family home. It's discovered that Matthew was actually setting up the "sightings" of his dead sister to give the family reason to exhume her body and give his mother closure. However, upon closer review, one of the [[hoax]] videos captures Alice's bedroom being searched by Brett, a neighbor for whom she had worked as a babysitter. After her own search of the bedroom, Alice's mother finds a hidden videotape showing Alice in a sexual encounter with Brett and his wife.

A psychic that the family had contacted earlier, when they thought Matthew's videos were real, admits that Alice had met with him several months before her death and had told him she was having dreams about drowning, being dead and her mother not being able to see or help her. Alice's boyfriend comes forward with cell phone footage showing Alice during a school trip to [[Lake Mungo]], in which she frantically digs into the sand at the base of a tree with her bare hands. Alice's family travels to Lake Mungo and finds the tree, where they dig up her cell phone. The footage on the phone shows her walking down the darkened shoreline of the lake and encountering a corpse-like [[doppelgänger]] of herself, appearing just as her body had been found in the lake.

Alice's family moves out of their house, feeling that she had simply wanted them to know who she really was and what she had seen. The film's [[Post-credits scene|mid-credit scenes]] reveal that Alice had actually manifested in Matthew's hoax pictures and videos without anybody noticing.

==Production==
The bulk of the film was written in 2005.  Anderson was finding it difficult to acquire funding for another script he had written which required a much larger budget.  After discussions with what would be future collaborators on ''Lake Mungo'', the decision was made to write something that could be filmed on a low budget.  When asked what inspired the script, Anderson has said, "I don't think it's a supernatural thriller. I think it's meant to be an exploration of grief." He also cited a curiosity as to how "technology is used to record people's lives and sort of tracks memories, and how technology mediates a lot of our experiences". Initial funding was attained through private investors, after which the production team approached the Australian government film funding body [[Screen Australia]] and received further funding.  During casting, low profile actors were sought in an effort to maintain an authentic documentary feel.  The film was shot over a period of approximately five weeks using multiple [[film format|film]] and [[video]] formats.  There was no written dialogue in the script, only the outline of the story, so the actors were tasked with improvising their scenes.  The director served as the offscreen interviewer in the many documentary style interview scenes that comprise the film.<ref>[http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=15981&s=Interviews Andrew L Urban, "ANDERSON, JOEL – LAKE MUNGO", ''Urban Cinefile'', 30 July 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113111936/http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=15981&s=Interviews |date=13 November 2012 }} accessed 11 November 2012</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Catiana|first1=John|title=An Interview with Joel Anderson|url=http://reviewmedia.ci.qut.edu.au/modules.php?name=News&file=print&sid=2788|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>
