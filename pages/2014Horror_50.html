==Plot==
Aaron ([[Patrick Brice]]) is a [[videographer]] who decides to go and work for Josef ([[Mark Duplass]]) after answering his ad. All Aaron has to do is record Josef throughout the day. After making him wait for quite a while, upon arrival, Josef insists on hugging Aaron, and insinuates there will be "more of that to come". Josef tells Aaron that he had beaten cancer two years earlier, but now has a large brain tumor. His wife, Angela, is pregnant, and Aaron will be recording a series of videos for his unborn son, as he is dying and will never be able to see him grow up. Josef tells Aaron that he and his wife are calling the baby "Buddy."

Later, Josef asks Aaron to go hiking with him. While getting a jacket, Aaron is startled by a wolf mask in the closet; Josef tells him that his father used to wear the mask, pretending to be a friendly wolf named Peachfuzz. While hiking, Josef claims to know of a secret place with "healing waters", and leads Aaron to a hidden waterfall. He writes "J+A" on a large stone with a rock, drawing a heart around the initials. Throughout their time together, Josef repeatedly scares Aaron, excusing his behavior by claiming he has a "weird sense of humor".

At a restaurant after their hiking trip, Josef admits to Aaron that he had taken photos of him before they had met, as he wanted to get to know Aaron before meeting him; he apologizes profusely. He also says that Aaron has an "animal in [him]", as he looked ready to kill Josef when Josef scares him. As Aaron gets ready to leave that night, Josef asks him to stay for a drink and to turn off the camera; Aaron shuts off the video, but leaves the sound on. Josef tells him he lied about Peachfuzz, and he wore the wolf mask in order to "rape" his wife to confirm his suspicions about her [[animal pornography]] habit. An unsettled Aaron drugs Josef's whiskey with Benadryl, lays him to sleep and takes his phone, which starts ringing. It is Josef's "wife", who tells Aaron that she is really just his sister, that her brother has problems and he needs to get out of the house. Aaron finds Josef gone; Josef scares him again and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Aaron attempts to leave, but Josef blocks him. Aaron charges at him, and the camera shuts off.

When the video resumes, Aaron reveals that he escaped and made it home, but soon received a DVD in the mail from Josef of him burying large trash bags in the yard; Aaron thinks it is meant as a threat. He has also been having terrible nightmares about Josef and him. Josef sends him a large box with a knife and a stuffed wolf in it, as well as another DVD with a video of Josef apologizing and saying that he really cares about Aaron. Josef now repeatedly calls Aaron "Buddy" in the videos. Aaron rips open the stuffed wolf, finding a locket with Josef's and Aaron's pictures in it, which he throws away.

After getting no help from the police, Aaron hears a trash can fall one night, and as he investigates his home, Josef appears at the front door. Days later, Josef takes the camera and films Aaron sleeping. Aaron finds another DVD labeled "My Last Video" in his house. Josef, in the video, apologizes again, revealing that he found the locket in Aaron's trash, which hurt him greatly. He claims this led to the realization that he needs help, as he is sad and needs a friend. He asks Aaron to come to the public lake by his house to talk so they could finally have "closure". His pleas move Aaron enough to compel him to go to the lake. Josef approaches him from behind, puts on the Peachfuzz mask, and swings an axe into Aaron's skull, killing him.

As a goodbye to Aaron, Josef films himself watching the murder tape, which he has already done several times before. He expresses admiration and even puzzlement at Aaron's naivety and kindness, and claims he loves him and considers him to be his favorite "of them all". He puts a DVD labeled "Aaron <3" in a cabinet full of videos and DVDs with different people's names on them, as he identifies himself as Bill over the phone while speaking to yet another person about hiring them for the same job for which he had hired Aaron.

==Production==
Duplass said that the film's story "was inspired by character-driven dramas that are, at their heart, two-handers: ''[[My Dinner with Andre]]'', ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'', and ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''" as well as "[his] myriad of strange [[Craigslist]] experiences over the years."<ref name=ac>{{cite web|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|title=Mark Duplass Is a Creep|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-07-14/mark-duplass-is-a-creep/|publisher=''[[The Austin Chronicle]]''|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref> Brice and Duplass originally began working on ''Creep'' under the working title ''Peachfuzz'', but chose to rename the film as the title's relevance came later in the movie's plot and they did not want viewers to "spend the first half hour trying to figure out why the movie is called Peachfuzz and [not] pay attention to the very intricate details".<ref name=STYD>{{cite web|last=Turek|first=Ryan|title=SXSW Interview: Mark Duplass, Patrick Brice on Bringing Creep to Life|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/349719-sxsw-interview-mark-duplass-patrick-brice-on-bringing-creep-to-life/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref> The two built the movie from a series of conversations they had with one another and decided to refine ''Creep'' while they were filming, which enabled them to film and screen portions of the film to see what would or wouldn't work on camera.<ref name=STYD /> As a result, the film had multiple alternate end scenarios and Duplass stated that there were "10 to 12 permutations of each scene".<ref name=STYD />

Of the creative process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained "We were interested in the psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don’t quite understand what’s up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe a little bit too much love here and there. But, for me, there’s something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'"<ref name=BD>{{cite web|title=Mark Duplass And Patrick Brice On Mixing Comedy And Terror In 'Creep'!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3282601/sxsw-14-interview-mark-duplass-and-patrick-brice-on-mixing-comedy-and-terror-in-creep/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref>
