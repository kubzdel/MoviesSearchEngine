'''''Jason X'''''{{efn|Pronounced as [[X|the letter X]], not 10}} is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[slasher film]] produced and directed by [[James Isaac]]. It is the tenth installment in the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]] and stars [[Kane Hodder]] in his fourth and final film appearance as the undead mass murderer [[Jason Voorhees]]. It also introduces his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.

The film was conceived by [[Todd Farmer]], and was the only pitch that he gave to the studio, having suggested sending Jason into space as a means to advance the film series, while a crossover film ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was still in [[development hell]].<ref name="Bryan Cairns">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/357/357840p1.html|title=An Interview with Jason X Writer Todd Farmer|author=Bryan Cairns|website=Movies.ign.com|accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref>

==Plot==
In the year 2010, [[Jason Voorhees]] ([[Kane Hodder]]) is captured by the United States government and held at the Crystal Lake Research Facility. Government scientist [[Rowan LaFontaine]] ([[Lexa Doig]]) decides to place Jason in frozen stasis after several failed attempts to kill him. While Private Samuel Johnson (Jeff Geddis) places a blanket on Jason, Dr. Wimmer ([[David Cronenberg]]), Sergeant Marcus (Markus Parilo), and a few soldiers hope to further research Jason's rapid [[Healing factor|cellular regeneration]] and try to take Jason. They pull off the blanket covering his body, but find Johnson dead, instead. Having broken free of his restraints, Jason kills the soldiers and Wimmer. Rowan lures Jason into a cryogenic pod and activates it. Jason then ruptures the pod with his machete and stabs Rowan in the abdomen, spilling cryogenic fluid into the sealed room and freezing them both.

445 years later (2455), Earth has become too polluted to support life and humans have moved to a new planet, Earth Two. Three students, Tsunaron ([[Chuck Campbell]]), Janessa ([[Melyssa Ade]]), and Azrael ([[Dov Tiefenbach]]), are on a field trip led by Professor Braithwaite Lowe ([[Jonathan Potts]]), who is accompanied by an Android robot, KM-14 ([[Lisa Ryder]]). They enter the Crystal Lake facility and find the still-frozen Jason and Rowan, whom they bring to their spaceship, the ''Grendel''. Also on the ship are Lowe's remaining students, Kinsa (Melody Johnson), Waylander (Derwin Jordan), and Stoney ([[Yani Gellman]]). They reanimate Rowan while Jason is pronounced dead and left in the morgue. Lowe's intern, Adrienne Thomas ([[Kristi Angus]]), is ordered to [[Dissection|dissect]] Jason's body. Lowe, who is in serious debt, calls his financial backer Dieter Perez ([[Robert A. Silverman]]), of the ''Solaris'', who recognizes Jason's name and notes that Jason's body could be worth a substantial amount to a collector.

While Stoney and Kinsa are having sex, Jason thaws out and attacks Adrienne, then freezes her face with [[liquid nitrogen]] before smashing her head to pieces on a counter. Jason takes a machete-shaped surgical tool and makes his way through the ship. He stabs Stoney in the chest and drags him to his death, to Kinsa's horror. Sergeant Brodski ([[Peter Mensah]]) leads a group of soldiers to attack Jason. Meanwhile, Jason attacks and kills Dallas by bashing his skull against the wall after breaking Azrael's back. He then tries to attack Crutch, but Brodski and his soldiers save him. Jason disappears; after Brodski splits up his team, Jason kills them one by one.

Lowe orders Pilot Lou ([[Boyd Banks]]) to dock in on ''Solaris'', a nearby [[space station]]. As he is talking with the ''Solaris'' engineer, he is hacked apart by Jason. With no pilot, the ship crashes through ''Solaris'', destroying it, and killing Dieter Perez and everyone else on the ''Solaris''. The crash damages one of the Grendel's pontoon sections. Jason breaks into the lab, reclaims his machete and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] Lowe.

With the ship badly damaged, the remaining survivors head for ''Grendel''{{'}}s shuttle, while Tsunaron heads elsewhere with KM-14. After finding Lou's remains, Crutch (Philip Williams) and Waylander prepare the shuttle. Rowan finds Brodski, but he is too heavy for her to carry, so she leaves to get help. Waylander leaves to help with him, while Crutch prepares the shuttle. Jason kills Crutch by electrocution. On board the shuttle, Kinsa hears of Crutch's death and has a [[panic attack]], she attempts to escape alone and leave everyone else for dead by launching the shuttle but forgets to release the fuel line, causing it to crash into the ship's hull and explode, killing her. Tsunaron reappears with an upgraded KM-14, complete with an array of weapons and new combat skills. She cartwheels and fights Jason off and seemingly kills him, knocking him into a [[Nanotechnology|nanite]]-equipped medical station and blasting off his right arm, left leg, right rib cage, and, finally, part of his head. The survivors send a distress call and receive a reply from a patrol shuttle.

The survivors set explosive charges to separate the remaining pontoon from the main drive section. As they work, Jason is accidentally brought back to life by the damaged medical station, rebuilt as an even more powerful [[cyborg]] called Uber Jason. Jason easily defeats KM-14 by punching her head off. As Tsunaron picks up her still-functioning head, Jason attacks them but is stopped by Waylander, who sacrifices himself by setting off the charges while the others escape. Jason survives and is blown back onto the shuttle. He punches a hole through the hull, [[Space exposure|blowing out]] Janessa. A power failure with the docking door forces Brodski to go [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] to fix it.

Meanwhile, a hard light [[Virtual reality|holographic simulation]] of Crystal Lake is created to distract Jason, along with two virtual teenagers to distract him, which works at first but he sees through the deception just as the door is fixed. Brodski confronts Jason so that the rest can escape. As they leave, the pontoon explodes, propelling Jason at high speed towards the survivors; however, Brodski intercepts Jason in mid-flight and maneuvers them both into the atmosphere of Earth Two, [[Atmospheric re-entry|incinerating]] them. Tsunaron, Rowan, and KM-14 celebrate having escaped successfully, and Tsunaron assures KM-14 that he will build a new body for her.

On Earth Two, a pair of teenagers beside a lake see what they believe is a [[Meteor|falling star]] as Jason's charred mask sinks to the bottom of the lake. The teenagers go to investigate.

==Production==
Development of ''Jason X'' began in the late 1990s while ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was still in [[development hell]]. With ''Freddy vs. Jason'' not moving forward, [[Sean S. Cunningham]] decided that he wanted another ''Friday the 13th'' film made to retain audience interest in the [[Jason Voorhees|character]]. The film was conceived by [[Todd Farmer]], who plays "Dallas" in the film, and was the only pitch he gave to the studio for the movie, having suggested sending Jason into space as a means to advance the film series.<ref name="Bryan Cairns"/>

The film score was composed and conducted by [[Harry Manfredini]]. It was released by [[Var√®se Sarabande]] on May 14, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/jason-x-original-motion-picture-soundtrack-mw0000222837|title=Jason X (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|publisher=AllMusic|date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> ''Jason X''{{'}}s theme song is "[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]" by [[Drowning Pool]] from their album ''[[Sinner (Drowning Pool album)|Sinner]]''.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the movie 0.5 stars out of 4, quoting one of the film's lines: "This sucks on so many levels."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020426/REVIEWS/204260302/1023 |title=Jason X Movie Review & Film Summary (2002) |website=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref>

However, the film was better received in the United Kingdom, gaining positive reviews from the country's two major film magazines, ''[[Total Film]]''<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/jason-x |title=Jason X review &#124; GamesRadar |website=Totalfilm.com |date=2014-09-11 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> and ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kim Newman |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=8136 |title=Jason X Review &#124; Movie - Empire |website=Empireonline.com |date=2015-10-11 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}</ref> ''Empire''{{'}}s review by [[Kim Newman]] in particular praised ''Jason X'' as "Wittily scripted, smartly directed and well-played by an unfamiliar cast, this is a real treat for all those who have suffered through the story so far."

Despite the initially negative reception from critics, the film has recently seen a retrospective growth in popularity, particularly among younger fans of the series.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3433796/doesnt-suck-look-back-jason-x/ |title=A Look Back at Jason X |website=bloodydisgusting.com |date=2017-04-26 |accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://nerdist.com/in-defense-of-jason-x-the-one-in-space/ |title=In Defense of Jason X |website=nerdist.com |date=2016-10-15 |accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> Praise has been directed at the film's ability to poke fun at itself and the film series as a whole, as well as inventive death scenes; Adrienne's death in particular (head frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then shattered against a table) is often singled out as a highlight, and was even tested on an episode of ''[[MythBusters (2009 season)#Episode 129 ‚Äì "Hurricane Windows"|MythBusters]]'' in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/shattering-heads |title=Shattering Heads |website=discovery.com |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref>
