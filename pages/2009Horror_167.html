'''''Raaz: The Mystery Continues''''', shortened as '''RTMC''', ({{lang-hi|राज़}}, English: ''Secret: The Mystery Continues'') is 2009 [[Bollywood|Indian]] [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Mohit Suri]] and starring [[Emraan Hashmi]] and [[Kangana Ranaut]]. The film is the second film in the ''[[Raaz (film series)|Raaz series]]'', but story-wise, it is not a direct sequel to the 2002 film ''Raaz''.<ref>[http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/apr/15video3.htm Raaz-The Mystery Continues is not a sequel][[Rediff]].com</ref><ref>[http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2007/05/16/9408/index.html Now 'Raaz 2' with Emraan Hashmi]''Bollywood Hungama'' Retrieved on 16 May 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/2007/01/17/8673/index.html Sequel to Raaz will not have the original cast] Retrieved on 17 January 2007</ref> The film deals with issues of the "evil within" the human psyche and how it manifests itself. It is based on the myths and superstitions that are still widely existent in the contemporary Indian society. The film attempts to challenge one’s beliefs about paranormal phenomena. Emraan Hashmi plays a painter, named Prithvi, who has an extraordinary gift, the ability to paint the future. His paintings tell Nandita's (Kangana Ranaut) future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianetindia.com/entertainment/raazthe-mystery-continues_5117.html|title=Raaz-the Mystery Continues plotline|date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=12 January 2009 |publisher=Kerala Online |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904124339/http://www.asianetindia.com/entertainment/raazthe-mystery-continues_5117.html |archivedate=2011-09-04}}</ref>

The film opened to theaters on 23 January 2009. It received generally mixed reviews and became a "semi hit" at the box office. A [[Raaz 3D|third installment]] in the ''[[Raaz (film series)|Raaz series]]'' was released in 2013 with Emraan Hashmi in the lead. Some of the scenes of the movie were similar to those of the Hollywood movies ''[[The Ring 2]]'' and ''[[Gothika]]''{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. It was first in a series of quasi-sequels released under the Bhatt Banner including ''[[Murder 2]]'', ''[[Jannat 2]]'', ''[[Jism 2]]'', ''[[Raaz 3D]]'' and ''[[1920: Evil Returns]]'', each of which had nothing to do with their respective prequels, but somehow fell in the same genre following a similar story.

==Plot==
The story starts with an American visiting the Kalindi Temple at night. There he sees the priest of the temple in a horrific state – he had slit his body with a [[scythe]] and had written '[[Om]]' on his body. The man, horrified by what he is seeing, flees from there. The story then shifts to a model in her early 20s, Nandita ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) who is in love with Yash, ([[Adhyayan Suman]]) a director and host of the reality show "Andhvishwas" a show dealing with various superstitions of Tanuja Twins ghosts mirror and tantric voodoos. Yash gifts Nandita an apartment where they start living and they love each other, in the meantime Nandita gets pregnant.

One evening, Nandita encounters Prithvi ([[Emraan Hashmi]]), an aspiring artist who is in search of his masterpiece. Prithvi tells Nandita that he made a sketch 4 months ago of a girl, who is actually Nandita. He also shows her a painting where she is lying with her wrist slit. He warns her of any type of danger. Regardless, Nandita accidentally slits her wrist due to an unknown ghostly attack on her in the bathroom. Prithvi saves her and admits her to a hospital. Yash arrives to the hospital and comes to know about her pregnancy and also her miscarriage due to excessive bleeding. She complains to Yash about Prithvi, and Yash gets him arrested, though he is released later on.

Meanwhile, at Kalindi, the same American, David Cooper (J. Brandon Hill), who is the Kalindi chemical plant owner, commits suicide by hanging himself after writing on the wall of his room, "Tum ashudh ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho" (You are impure, you are rotten from inside), with his blood. The inspector investigating the suicide is severely affected by it. Back at his home, Prithvi makes another picture of Nandita getting mobbed. He runs to a fashion show where Nandita is performing, and witnesses her being possessed and attacking a spiritual guru attending the show. She then says the same lines, "Tum ashudh Ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho", to the guru. Prithvi rushes to her rescue, but is prevented by the guards. Nandita is taken away from the guru and audience. The guru later appears on TV, claiming she had been possessed. Coming to know about everything, Yash has her publicly apologise to everyone, and declares that she has mental problems.

After the guards release Prithvi, Nandita is possessed again in her bathroom, with same lines appearing in the mirror. She goes to Prithvi for help, but he refuses her, showing her a new painting in which she is hanging herself and the same lines seem to appear behind her. He also shows her some news clippings about the death of the priest and David Cooper, with the same lines written behind them. Nandita thanks him and leaves to attend a party with Yash. There she is possessed and attacked again, and starts bleeding. Meanwhile, Prithvi prepares himself to help Nandita by burning the ominous painting of Nandita, which symbolises that he will protect her. He spots Nandita running from the party, apparently bleeding, and follows her. He finally catches up to her in a slum, where he sees her writing the same lines as before with her blood. He tries to stop her, but realises that she is possessed. She then tries to commit suicide but he prevents her from doing so. Yash arrives to find Nandita in Prithvi's arms.

Yash agrees to help Nandita on the condition she leaves Prithvi, but she refuses his help and decides to stay with Prithvi and visit Kalindi to find out the truth. Prithvi and Nandita spend the night in a guest house, where Nandita is possessed once again. The spirit leads her to a forest where she is repeatedly attacked by paranormal beings. She receives visions of people hanging from trees. She then spots a well and somebody standing near it, and goes towards them. Just as she is about to jump, Prithvi catches her. It is revealed that the 'well' was actually the steep edge of a cliff. They arrive at Kalindi and meet the priest's wife (who is living life as a prostitute) who tells them that it was her husband who was evil and his death was not surprising, considering the crimes he had committed against innocent people in the name of religion. They decide to go to the police inspectors' house (the same one who investigated David Coopers' suicide), where they find him completely crazy and are unable to prevent him from committing suicide.

Nandita and Prithvi soon continue their journey by jeep. One night while travelling, they are attacked by animals. Nandita escapes the jeep and heads towards the trees, where she finds the same well. This time, before Prithvi can save her, she jumps into it. Prithvi follows her. Inside the well, Nandita comes to know that it was Prithvi's father, Veer Pratap Singh (Jackie Shroff), who was possessing her. It so happened that he discovered that the Kalindi chemical plant dumps its toxins into a lake where thousands gathered once a year to bathe in a sacred ritual. He lodges a complaint against David Cooper but is warned by the policeman and the priest against taking any action, or his life will be in peril. He merely replies, "Tum ashudh Ho, andar sey sadh chuke ho". Veer Pratap tries to tell the truth to everyone, but is killed by the goons of the priest and his body is dumped in the same well. His spirit returns for his revenge. He kills David Cooper, and the policeman and priest who sided with David. Prithvi finally learns the truth, but is still confused as to why Nandita was used for this. They come to know that it was Yash who had all the proof of Veer Singh's death, but he had sold those proofs to David in return for sponsorship of his show. Nandita tries to escape with the proof but is just about shot by Yash, when Prithvi saves her. Unfortunately for both, Prithvi is stabbed by Yash. In the end however, the spirit of Veer attacks and kills Yash. Before moving on, Veer heals Prithvi's wounds after which Nandita and Prithvi are reunited.

==Production==

===Development===
Screenwriter [[Shagufta Rafiq]] in an interview stated that the story is weaved around [[Sant Kabir]]'s idiom, "''Bura jo dekhan main chala, Bura na milya koi; Jo dil khoja apna, Ta mujh sa bura na koi''", which means that the evil is within oneself and that is the message of the film.<ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/bhatts-making-indian-version-of-the-omen_10074306.html Bhatts making Indian version of ‘The Omen’] Thaindian News Retrieved on 2009-01-22</ref> The director was changed from [[Vikram Bhatt]] (who was the original ''Raaz'' director) to [[Mohit Suri]].<ref>[http://www.radiosargam.com/films/archives/9089/mohit-suri-to-debut-with-emraan-in-raaz-2.html Mohit Suri to direct Raaz 2 with Emraan]</ref> Suri had reportedly added a lot of dramatic space to the film and played around with visuals and sounds which led to an extraordinary pace.<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2009/emraan-praises-mohit-080109.html Emraan praises Mohit for Raaz The Mystery Continues] Retrieved on 12 January 2009</ref> Suri got inspired about the movie after reading a lot on [[Hindu mythology]], where good and evil are represented in stark contrast.<ref>[http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/raaz---the-mystery-continues-explores-the-evil-within.html Exploring the evil within] Retrieved on 12 January 2009</ref>

Also it was distributed through Sony BMG banner, however the prequel ''Raaz'' (2002) was distributed by Tips Industries.

===Casting===
Originally it was thought that [[Bipasha Basu]] would be called for RTMC since she hasn't worked with the Bhatts post ''[[Jism (2003 film)|Jism]]''. But later it was announced that she has been dropped and [[Kangana Ranaut]] took her place.<ref>[http://in.movies.yahoo.com/news-detail/9169/Bipasha-Dropped-From-Raaz-2.html Bipasha dropped from Raaz 2]</ref> Even [[Amrita Rao]] was also considered but she passed the opportunity.<ref>[http://www.radiosargam.com/films/archives/10636/why-busy-amrita-turned-down-raaz-2.html Busy Amrita turned down Raaz 2]</ref> [[Emraan Hashmi]] joined the cast taking over from [[Dino Morea]]. Dino expressed his disappointment with the decision by saying "I'm not disappointed but definitely baffled. How can they make a ''Raaz 2'' without anyone from the original cast? How can it be a sequel, then?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/mirchmasala/How-can-they-do-Raaz-2-without-me-Dino/Article1-277616.aspx|title= Dino Morea'z disappointment over Raaz 2|accessdate= 15 December 2008|work=[[Hindustan Times]]}}</ref> Later it was announced that ''Raaz – The Mystery Continues'' is not a sequel to the original movie. [[Adhyayan Suman]] plays Yash, a documentary filmmaker who is perceived as an atheist and believes in scientific rationale behind everything. His beliefs are challenged in the film. He reportedly called this film his debut, although he debuted in [[Bollywood]] with the 2008 film ''[[Haal-e-dil]]''.<ref>[http://www.glamsham.com/movies/interviews/29-adhyayan-suman-interview-120805.asp Interview with Adhyayan Suman] Retrieved on 12 January 2009</ref> Actress [[Sonal Chauhan]] was also reported to play a part in the movie,<ref>[http://bollywoodgyaan.com/2008/06/12/sonal-chauhan-bags-raaz-2-post-jannat/ Sonal Chauhan bags Raaz 2, post ''Jannat''] Retrieved on 15 December 2008</ref> however she could not be a part of the final cast. Incidentally, Kangana again plays a supermodel called Nandita in this film, right after ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]''. Since playing a supermodel, she had to reportedly undergo many types of looks and even changed her hair colour to red.<ref>[http://www.newkerala.com/topstory-fullnews-68235.html Kangana goes red] Retrieved on 12 January 2009</ref> Emraan Hashmi plays a dark character as the painter, Prithvi, who has no contact with the outside world. His character is the main link to the fate of Kangana's character. According to the actor, though comparisons are evident with the earlier ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', this film has a different plot and will give a new definition to the horror genre. Veteran actor [[Jackie Shroff]] was reported to be playing Kangana's father in the movie, which after release was revealed to be Emraan's father's character.<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/news/2008/jackie-Kangana-father-170608.html Jackie Shroff is Kangana's mysterious father] Retrieved on 28 January 2009</ref>

==Critical reception==
Early reception for the movie was mostly mixed. The ''[[Times of India]]'' gave 3 out of 5 stars saying that,"Emraan Hashmi & Kangana bring the Gangster magic again....they have done a good job whereas Adhyayan Suman shows promise."<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/RaazThe-Mystery-Continues/movie-review/4023535.cms Times of India review of Raaz – The Mystery Continues] Retrieved on 27 January 2009</ref> ''[[Bollywood Hungama]]'' gave a good review saying "On the whole, Raaz – The Mystery Continues is rich in the horror quotient and that is one of its major USPs, besides the highly competent performances by its principal cast and a lilting musical score. At the box-office, this one will continue the winning streak of Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films. The 4-day weekend [Monday, January 26 in a holiday] will only cement its status further. Go for it!". The lead actors were praised for their performance. In the review, "On the acting front, both Emraan and Kangana vie for top honours. Emraan is excellent. He conveys a lot through facial expressions and that's the sign of a proficient actor. He's just getting better and better with every film. Kangana is top notch. After ''[[Fashion (2008 film)|Fashion]]'', this one's another power-packed performance from the actress. Adhyayan Suman is super-confident and registers a strong impact, especially towards the climax. He shows promise. Jackie Shroff is quite okay in a brief role."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/reviews/2009/raaz-the-mystery-continues-review-230109.html|title=Raaz The Mystery Continues Review|date=23 January 2009|accessdate=23 January 2009|author=Taran Adarsh|publisher=[[Oneindia.in]]}}</ref> ''[[NDTV]]'' gave negative reviews for the movie saying "The first Raaz, which married the Hollywood film What Lies Beneath with the myth of Savitri who pursued Yamraj until her husband came back to life, had a cheesy appeal.

The music received positive reviews and tracks like [[Maahi]], ''Kaisa Ye Raaz Hai'' and ''Soniyo'' were particularly praised. ''[[NDTV]]'' gave a good review saying "Overall, the music of Raaz – The Mystery Continues has its own place under the sun. It is definitely worth listening."<ref name="ndtv"/>

''One India'' gave a positive review saying "The music of Raaz – TMC indeed impresses, the soundtrack here is yet another good addition to the enviable music catalogue of the Bhatts and Emraan would certainly have some more chartbusters to add to his name. As for the last question i.e. whether Raaz – TMC matches up to Nadeem-Shravan's ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', then well, let's put it this way that albums like [[Aashiqui]], Raaz or a [[Saajan]] are made only once and there shouldn't even be a conscious effort to replicate or surpass them. In this regard, the music of Raaz – TMC has its own place under the sun and what matters in the end is whether it works for the film or not. Well, the answer for this one is a firm Yes!<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/music/reviews/2008/raaz-music-review-171208.html Raaz – The Mystery Continues music review] ''One India.com'' Retrieved on 22 December 2008</ref> Thaindian News also reviewed the music for the film. They said "“Soniyo" is the best number of the album. Sung by Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal, the pleasant track moves at a very steady pace. Kumar keeps the lyrics as simple as the composition and it gives the singers ample space. Consisting mainly of melodic, slow paced tracks, the frontrunners of this album are two fast numbers. Both "O Jaana" and "Soniyo" are the highlights of the pack.<ref>[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/entertainment/fast-peppy-numbers-shine-in-raaz-sequel-ians-music-review_100135977.html Fast, peppy numbers shine in ‘Raaz’ sequel] Retrieved on 20 January 2009</ref> But at the above the song [[Maahi]] became a blockbuster hit after its release. According to the Indian trade website [[Box Office India]], with around 13,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's twelfth highest-selling.<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Hits 2000–2009 (Figures in Units)|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=286&catName=MjAwMC0yMDA5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624132928/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=286&catName=MjAwMC0yMDA5|archivedate=24 June 2010|publisher=[[Box Office India]]}}</ref>
