Released publicly for one night in December 2011, ''Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance'' had its wide commercial release on February 17, 2012, in 3D and 2D.

Critical reception was largely negative; critics criticized the script, CGI, and acting.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_rider_spirit_of_vengeance/ |title=Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> The film grossed more than $132 million, against its $57 million production budget.<ref name="Collider" /> Nicolas Cage has said that he is "done" with the [[Ghost Rider#Film|''Ghost Rider'' films]] and a planned sequel was canceled.

== Plot ==
{{long plot|date=April 2016}}
In [[Romania]], a French priest named Moreau warns the monks of a monastery about an impending attack by the devil's forces to obtain a boy named Danny. The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help.

Eight years have passed since [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] became the [[Ghost Rider]] – a [[Vengeful ghost|vengeful, fiery spirit]] who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how big or small the infraction — anything from [[genocide]] to a [[white lie]] — the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Blaze into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthood's ability to restore Johnny's soul and remove the Ghost Rider's curse. Meanwhile, pursuers force Nadya and Danny from the road and bring them to their leader: her former boyfriend Ray Carrigan. Carrigan has Danny tied up and is about to execute Nadya when the Ghost Rider appears; the Ghost Rider kills several of Carrigan's men and then moves in on Danny. Nadya distracts the Ghost Rider, who then is shot with grenades into submission.

Johnny awakens in a hospital. On the way out, he convinces Nadya not to trust him, but to accept his help to find Danny. Carrigan tells [[Mephisto (comics)|Roarke]] about the Rider, and Roarke speaks an incantation to Danny via phone, which effectively puts up a "firewall" preventing the Rider from sensing Danny's whereabouts. He warns Carrigan it will not shield him from being sensed and gives him instructions to deliver Danny. Nadya later tells Blaze that as she lay dying, she made a deal with Roarke: her life in return for him impregnating her with Danny, making Danny a direct vessel for Roarke and the potential for him to have unlimited power on the surface world. Roarke lacks this power so far from [[Hell]]. Danny nearly escapes, but breaks his ankle and is recaptured. That night, Nadya and Johnny interrogate a known contact of Carrigan's. Johnny takes off ahead of Nadya to deal with Carrigan. Nadya saves Danny as the Rider converts a mining machine (a [[Bagger 288]]<ref name=InterviewNeveldineTaylor>{{cite web|title='Chatting with Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance directors Neveldine and Taylor'|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/chatting-with-ghost-rider-spirit-of-vengeance-directors-neveldine-and-taylor/ |accessdate=December 16, 2013}}</ref>) into a massive fiery machine, destroying their hideout complex and mortally wounding Carrigan. When Ghost Rider catches up to Nadya and starts to use his Penance Stare on her, Danny is able to stop the Rider with a word, exercising his hidden power.
[[File:Bagger-garzweiler.jpg|thumb|290px| A special prop: The [[Bagger 288]], the heaviest land vehicle in the world from 1978–1995]]

Moreau catches up with the group as they ride off. Roarke is not done with Carrigan; using his power, he turns Carrigan into a demon called [[Blackout (Lilin)|Blackout]] capable of instantly decaying anything he touches while shrouded in darkness. Johnny and Nadya bring Danny to Moreau's monastery with warm reception. Moreau explains that the Ghost Rider is the twisted incarnation of the Spirit of Justice, [[Zarathos]], after being captured and tortured to madness while in Hell. Moreau tells Johnny that he can exorcise the spirit from him if Johnny tells a secret that only he knows of. Johnny confesses that his deal with Roarke was really a selfish one: his stepfather had accepted his [[cancer]] and was ready to die; Johnny was the one who did not want him to go. With this confession, Moreau exorcises Johnny of the spirit and Johnny becomes human again. The head monk Methodius ([[Christopher Lambert]]) proclaims that Danny will never be safe from the influence of evil and says he must die, taking Johnny, Moreau, and Nadya captive in order to execute the boy. Carrigan intervenes, killing the monks and taking Danny captive again to deliver to Roarke. The others follow, with Johnny not wanting to desert Danny after having promised to protect him. With the ritual to transfer Roarke's spirit and power into Danny underway, the three infiltrate the compound to save him. Carrigan kills Moreau, but Danny (who Roarke states has the same powers as he does) gives Johnny back the power of the Ghost Rider. Roarke manages to escape with Danny and the Ghost Rider and Nadya give pursuit. After a vehicular struggle, Ghost Rider manages to defeat Carrigan and causes the SUV carrying Roarke and Danny to crash. The Ghost Rider sends Roarke back into Hell while Danny, who had died in the accident, is returned to his mother. Channeling the blue flame of Zarathos, Johnny manages to revive Danny and assures him of his safety.

As the film closes, the angelic blue flaming Ghost Rider rides off on his motorcycle, saying: "My name is Johnny Blaze. I'm the Ghost Rider."
