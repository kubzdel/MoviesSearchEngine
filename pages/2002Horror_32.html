'''''Eight Legged Freaks''''' is a 2002 [[Horror film|horror]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Ellory Elkayem]] and starring [[David Arquette]], [[Kari Wuhrer]], [[Scott Terra]] and [[Scarlett Johansson]]. An international co-production between Germany, the United States, and Australia, the plot concerns a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. The film was dedicated to the memory of several people: One was [[Lewis Arquette]], father of the star of the film David Arquette, who had died in 2001 from heart failure, and the other two were [[Don Devlin]] and [[Pilar Seurat]], the parents of producer [[Dean Devlin]], who both died of lung cancer in 2000 and 2001, respectively.

==Synopsis==
The quiet [[Arizona]] mining town, Prosperity's problem with giant spiders started with a simple accident where a truck carrying barrels of toxic waste swerved trying not to hit a rabbit, throwing a barrel into the reservoir. Thus, begins the food chain reaction. An exotic spider farmer named Joshua Taft ([[Tom Noonan]]) feeds his collection of spiders, which include [[jumping spiders]], [[tarantulas]], [[trapdoor spider]]s, male [[orb-weaver spider|orb-weaver]] spiders, and a female orb-weaver named Consuela, with crickets caught from the reservoir. As a result, they grow to enormous size, with an ever-increasing appetite. They start terrorizing the town, attacking, killing, abducting and devouring people. So begins the battle between the giant spiders and the people of Prosperity.

==Production==
Director [[Ellory Elkayem]] got the idea from his 1997 short film, ''Larger Than Life'', which also handled a spider-fighting storyline.

The film was originally titled ''Arac Attack'' (under which it was released in some parts of Europe and other countries around the world) but its similarity to "[[Iraq]] Attack" made the title seem inappropriate near the start of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq War]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The title ''Eight Legged Freaks'' is a line that Arquette ad-libbed in the movie: "Get back, you eight-legged freaks!"{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

;Filming locations
* The town of Prosperity does not exist in Arizona. The scenes inside Prosperity Mall were actually shot in an abandoned mall in [[Glendale, Arizona]]. The location was formerly Valley West Mall and also known as Manistee town center. This movie would be the last operation that took place in the mall, as it was demolished soon after shooting was completed. The Mall land was redeveloped into a retail strip afterwards.
* The scenes in Aunt Gladys's house in the kitchen and in Gladys' basement were filmed at the Manistee Ranch in Glendale, Arizona, directly adjacent to the Mall itself.
* Some of the town scenes were shot in the old copper mining town of Superior, Arizona.
;Spiders used in the film
* [[Orb-weaver spider]]
* [[Jumping spider]]
* [[Tarantula]] (several species are featured, including the [[Mexican redknee tarantula]], the Pink Foot Goliath, and the [[Goliath birdeater]])
* [[Trapdoor spider]]
* [[Australian funnel-web spider]]
* [[Spitting spider]]

;Alternate credits
* The alternate beginning is an extended version in which Harlan does a broadcast promoting the mall, after which a worker at the mall sees Wade having the toxic waste put in the basement.
* In the alternate ending, after the mines are blown up, the townsfolk walk down a road to get help. They meet up with Pete and Harlan who were walking through the desert, Pete trying to convince Harlan the spiders were not aliens. Afterward, Sam and Chris kiss as the scene ends.
