'''''The Hole''''' is a 2001 British [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Nick Hamm]], and starring [[Thora Birch]], [[Desmond Harrington]], [[Keira Knightley]], [[Daniel Brocklebank]], and [[Embeth Davidtz]]. Based on the novel ''[[After the Hole]]'' by [[Guy Burt]], the film follows a group of English [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] students who, upon spending a weekend partying in an underground [[Fallout shelter|shelter]], find themselves locked inside.

Filmed in 2000, the film featured actress Birch in the lead role, whose headlining credit and highly publicized seven-figure salary was attributed to her appearance in ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' (1999).<ref>[http://www.netribution.co.uk/features/interviews/2001/thora_birch/1.html Interview with Birch], just after the film's release in the UK</ref> It also marked Knightley's first major role in a feature film.

The film premiered in the United Kingdom in April 2001.  [[Dimension Films]], which in October 2001 acquired the rights to distribute the film theatrically in the United States, never did so; it was instead released [[direct-to-video]] nearly two years later, by Dimension's then-fellow Disney subsidiary [[Buena Vista Distribution]].<ref>[https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808404424 Preview and Summary] from [[Yahoo!]] Movies</ref> The film was shot at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]] and various locations around southern England, including [[Downside School]] in [[Somerset]].

==Plot==
Preparatory school student Liz resurfaces, disheveled and bloody, after disappearing 18 days prior along with her peers Mike, Geoff, and Geoff's girlfriend, Frankie. Liz is interviewed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Philippa Horwood. Liz recounts how her friend Martyn arranged for the four to spend the weekend in an abandoned underground [[Fallout shelter|nuclear fallout shelter]] to avoid a school field trip. 

When Martyn fails to return for them, the four belatedly realize they are trapped, and begin to turn on one another. They discover hidden microphones in the shelter which were placed there by Martyn. Attempting to get Martyn's attention, Frankie pretends to be ill, while Mike and Liz feign hatred for one another; Martyn has had unrequited romantic feelings for her since their childhood. Liz claims they woke up one morning and found the hatch opened, allowing them all to finally escape.

Philippa is skeptical of Liz's story. Martyn is subsequently taken into police custody, where he tells an entirely different story: He claims Liz and Frankie orchestrated the scheme in order for Liz to get to know Mike better, and for Frankie to spend time with Geoff. Meanwhile, Liz returns home, where she experiences disturbing flashbacks about what happened. An enraged Martyn goes to visit Liz, believing she is framing him. She runs from him through the garden and approaches a [[weir]]. Martyn cries, and Liz hysterically says that she knew they would let him go because they could not prove anything. 

At their next meeting, Liz tells Phillipa that she cannot remember what happened in the shelter. Phillipa decides to bring her there, hoping to invoke her memory. Once inside, Liz reveals the truth: She had locked herself and her friends inside in the hopes of winning Mike's affection, with whom she was obsessed. After discovering that both he and Geoff had slept with Frankie, she spontaneously decided to lock the door, isolating them and giving her the opportunity to become closer to him. Initially, the four had planned to drink and do drugs in the shelter, but the realization that they were unable to escape initiated group hysteria. After several days, Frankie died from side effects of her [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]].

Liz, Mike, and Geoff gradually ran out of food and water. When Mike discovered that Geoff was hoarding [[Coca-Cola]] in his backpack, he killed him in a fit of rage. Liz suggested a [[suicide pact]], whereupon Mike professed his love for her; this prompted her to climb the ladder toward the shelter's entrance and unlock the door. When Mike realized she had the key all along, he attempted to chase after her, but fell to his death from the ladder. 

After Liz finishes recounting the story to Phillipa, Phillipa asks her to make an official statement corroborating Martyn's version of events; Liz refuses, having murdered Martyn when he visited her at her home the day prior. Police arrive at the shelter, and Liz begins screaming for help, pretending Phillipa was attempting to hurt her. Meanwhile, Martyn's corpse is fished out of the river; in his pocket, police find the key to the shelter, which implicates him in the events. The police attribute his death to suicide. Liz is allowed to go free. She leaves the shelter in the back of an ambulance, smiling at Phillipa from the window as it drives away.
