==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->
A terrified mother and her young son are packing a suitcase. She hears something outside the door and makes her son hide under the bed. The door bursts open and an unseen force throws the mother against the wall, killing her. The son flees and runs into his terrified sister. The boy hides, but his sister is caught and pushed over a banister, then dragged to the cellar. The hiding boy is eventually found by the attacker.

Five years later, the Solomon family from Chicago moves into the house, near a small town in North Dakota. Roy Solomon is planning to start a sunflower farm. The teenage daughter, Jess, is upset about moving away from her friends. Some time ago, Jess had driven drunk with her younger brother, Ben, a toddler at the time. She crashed the car, seriously injuring Ben. He recovered from his injuries, but [[Selective mutism|does not speak]]. Her parents, Roy and Denise, have a hard time trusting her and they are broke because of the expenses for Ben's treatment. Roy believes moving to the farm will help heal the family.

Ominous events begin to occur. The house always has crows flying around it. Some attack Roy; but they're driven off by a drifter named John Burwell, whom Roy hires as a farmhand. Ben sees ghosts of the mother and the children, though they do not seem to be frightened. Jess wakes up sees Ben walking into the barn, Jess goes outside and walks in the barn. Jess is slowly walking around in the barn when the doors slam shut. Jess opens the barn door attempts to run to the house but stops when she steps into a quicksand type mud pit. Jess is slowly trying to walk through the pit but is slowly sinking up to her knees, Jess is up to her waist and is slowly sinking in. Jess is clawing at the ground while she is sinking up to her neck, a glimpse of Jess's face sinking down in the mud when Jess sits up and realizing it was a dream until she removes her blanket revealing that is was real.

Determined to prove her claims, and goes into town with Bobby to learn more. She discovers that the Rollins family, the house's previous owners, left suddenly five years ago. Jess believes that they didn't move, and that something terrible happened to them. While at a local store, Jess sees a newspaper clipping of the family, with the father revealed to be none other than her dad's new farmhand. John Burwell is actually John Rollins, the man who, in a fit of madness, murdered his entire family (the beginning of the film). Shocked, Jess rushes back to the house with Bobby to warn her family.

At the house Denise prepares to leave when John attacks her, Denise runs inside the house and attempts to run up the stairs when a hand reaches out and grabs Denise's ankle. Realizing Jess had been right, she becomes determined to leave. John is viciously attacked by the crows, and his mental state becomes unbalanced. He believes Denise is his wife Mary, trying to leave him again as the actual Mary had 5 years before. He attacks Denise, but she grabs Ben and hides in the cellar. Bobby and Jess arrive, but John knocks Bobby out with a pitchfork. Jess runs into the cellar and finds Denise and Ben. Denise apologizes to Jess for not believing her about the ghosts. John looks for them, believing that Jess is his daughter Lindsay, and Ben is his son Michael. Roy arrives but is stabbed by John. John grabs Jess's ankle and drags her down the basement stairs John asks Jess, thinking that she's Lindsay, if they are still a family Jess kicks John in the mud. John grabs Jess's foot and starts pulling her in with him, Jess is  slowly crawling out of the mud and John is pulling Jess back in. Jess claws at the floor and Jess reaches her up screaming for help, John starts pushing Jess down in the mud. Jess attempts to scream for help but Jess's head sinks completely down in the mud leaving her hand to slowly sink down in, An injured Roy grabs Jess's hand  and is attempting to pull Jess out of the mud, Denise reaches down to grab Jess's other hand and starts pulling. Jess begins to resurface from under the mud and being pulled out, Jess's legs are pulled out of the mud Jess is crying and Denise hugs Jess.

Thanks to Bobby, Officer Drew and paramedics arrive shortly after the attack. As Roy is loaded into the ambulance, he apologizes to Jess. Some time later, everything has returned to normal. The crows no longer attack, the ghosts stop appearing, and Ben starts talking again. The family is happy once more.

==Production==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
Ravens were used in the movie, not crows, however the characters say "crows" in the film. The production team could not obtain trained crows required for certain scenes.

The film began life as an original script called ''The Scarecrow'' by [[Todd Farmer]]. It was originally written as a psychological thriller as opposed to a more supernatural horror film. It was about a family on a farm suffering from financial problems and bad weather seasons. When the patriarch puts up a strange [[scarecrow]] out in the field, things start to change. But then people start to get killed, and the main character suspects the scarecrow. By the end, the main character is revealed actually to have caused the killings himself.

The script was sold to [[Revolution Studios]]. Director [[Patrick Lussier]] signed on to the film, and put a supernatural flair into the story. Revolution then brought in [[Stuart Beattie]] to rewrite the script. "What I pitched was 'the horror version of ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'','" said Farmer, "and what they wanted was '''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' on a farm.'" Revolution then sold it to Ghost House Pictures, who then took it and hired Mark Wheaton to rewrite it. None of the original script survived through the rewrites, besides the farm setting, and character names.

The original ''Scarecrow'' script was finally used as the basis for the [[prequel]], ''[[Messengers 2: The Scarecrow]]''.

Club]] wrote that the film was "technically proficient enough to deliver the requisite jolts, but [[déjà vu]] haunts the film as surely as its pasty-faced, hitch-stepped ghoulies, and it's hard to shake the impression that we've seen this movie before."  <ref>[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/58202]</ref>   Writing for the site Reel Views, James Berardinelli wrote that "''The Messengers'' borrows so heavily from (other horror movies) that it has no room left for anything of its own.<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/messengers.html]</ref>
