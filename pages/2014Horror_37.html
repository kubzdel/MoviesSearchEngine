==Reception==
Joshua Brunsting from ''Criterion Cast'' wrote, "Soisson’s new film opens rather well. Erotically charged and not afraid of slowly building tension, the opening “act” is arguably the film’s strongest point. Perfectly paced and featuring some fun performances, the opening sequence is tense and lushly shot, all throwing a cloud of impending doom over the proceedings."<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Joshua Reviews Joel Soisson's CAM2CAM, Theatrical Review.|url=https://criterioncast.com/reviews/theatrical/joshua-reviews-joel-soissons-cam2cam-theatrical-review|publisher=Criterioncast.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> Dennis Harvey from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "a sloppy chiller about tourists falling prey to an online stalker in Bangkok that clumsily mixes slasher, sexploitation and supernatural elements."<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Variety Film Review: ‘Cam2Cam’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-cam2cam-1201288154/|publisher=Variety Magazine|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> AwardsWiz.com wrote, "an ending I found satisfying and clearly sequel worthy." <ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|title=Film Review ‘Cam2Cam’|url=http://www.awardswiz.com/2014/08/cam2cam-review.html|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>
