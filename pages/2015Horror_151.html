Ascher chose his subject because it had happened to him in the past.<ref name=vulture />

The film's crew initially began approaching participants via "message groups, [[YouTube]] videos, and a half dozen books that had been written", but found that participants began approaching them after the documentary's premise was announced.<ref name=vulture>{{cite web|last1=Ebiri|first1=Bilge|title=Sundance: Room 237 Director Rodney Ascher on His New Documentary The Nightmare|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/sundance-room-237-director-on-his-new-doc.html|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref> 

==Synopsis==
The documentary focuses on eight people suffering from [[sleep paralysis]], a phenomenon where people find themselves temporarily unable to move, speak, or react to anything while they are falling asleep or awakening. Occasionally this paralysis will be accompanied by physical experiences or hallucinations that have the potential to terrify the individual. In the film, Ascher interviews each participant and then tries to re-create their experiences on film with professional actors.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE NIGHTMARE|url=http://www.sundance.org/projects/the-nightmare|publisher=Sundance|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>

The film received praise from media outlets such as [[Indiewire]], [[Screen Daily]], and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kohn|first1=Eric|title=Sundance Review: Rodney Ascher's 'The Nightmare' is One of the Scariest Documentaries Ever|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-rodney-aschers-the-nightmare-is-one-of-the-scariest-documentaries-ever-20150127|publisher=Indiewire|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=Anthony|title=The Nightmare (review)|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/the-nightmare/5082318.article|publisher=Screen Daily|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref> and ''Variety'' wrote that "Mixing talking heads, surreal bedtime re-creations and shamelessly assaultive scare tactics, Ascher's playful, visually inventive sophomore feature isn’t at the same level as ''[[Room 237]]'' but that "it shares with its predecessor a warped affection for eccentric storytellers and a desire to give vivid cinematic form to their darkest imaginings, if that is indeed what they are."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chang|first1=Justin|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The Nightmare’|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-nightmare-1201419407/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>

[[Shock Till You Drop]] remarked on how well the film was received at Sundance where one viewer "cried in gratitude of the film", and went on to state that although Ascher did not consult any professional scientists or doctors, the documentary was still effective in inciting terror.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Samuel|title=Sundance Review: The Nightmare, a Terrifying Horror-Doc|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/373397-sundance-review-nightmare-terrifying-horror-doc/|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}</ref>

[[IGN]] was more negative, awarding the film a score of 3.5 out of 10 and saying "Like a person floating on the edge of sleep who never quite succumbs, The Nightmare grazes its subject but never truly dives in."<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/06/04/the-nightmare-review?%20hub%20page%20(front%20page)</ref>
