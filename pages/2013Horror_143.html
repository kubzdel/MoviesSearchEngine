==Plot==
Pastor Dan ([[James Tupper]]), his wife Wendy ([[Anne Heche]]), and their three children Rebecca ([[Rebekah Brandes]]), Mary ([[Jennifer Stone]]), and Christopher (Carter Cabassa), have just moved to the small town of [[Stull, Kansas]], where Dan will serve as the new pastor. While traveling to the town, Rebecca sees a teenage boy killing a sheep and collecting the blood. Along the way Dan meets the farmer, Mason (Wayne Pére), and eventually the family moves into their new home, assisted by the town's old pastor, Pastor Kingsman ([[Clancy Brown]]) and parish members. Later that night, Rebecca has a nightmare.

The following day, Pastor Kingsman gives the family a cake that a parish member baked for them as a token of gratitude. Mary later decides to have a slice of the cake but is choked by a tooth baked into the snack. Meanwhile, Rebecca meets the same boy that she saw killing sheep, Noah ([[Ethan Peck]]), who takes her out to see the town. Their fun is interrupted when Mason comes to get Noah, telling him that Pastor Kingsman wants to see him. Rebecca returns home and finds that Mary is feeling ill. Meanwhile, Noah is told by Pastor Kingsman that he should do what is to be done because it is God's will. Noah begrudgingly says that since Mary has discovered the tooth in the cake, she is the chosen one. It turns out that the tooth in the cake is a form of lottery, and whoever comes across it first will be marked as selected.

The film then shifts to Wendy and her family making food for the upcoming Summer Festival, which will begin in a couple of days. The children go into town to do some sightseeing, where Rebecca ends up running into Noah. The two of them end up going on a date on the observation platform of the [[fire lookout tower]] in the forest surrounding the town and Rebecca notices a scar on Noah's hand, which he tries to hide. She then notices that a man is watching them from the bottom of the lookout tower.

The next day Rebecca and Mary meet Noah at the festival. He takes them to get some lemonade at a nearby stall, only for Mary's lemonade to end up being drugged with a poison. Mary gets violently ill and tries to go home but is kidnapped by Mason. She awakens to find herself tied to a post while Pastor Kingsman tells her that she was chosen according to God's will. He then opens the "Gateway to Hell", resulting in Mary becoming possessed by the Devil. He then takes her back to her family, telling them that she was sick. Noah unsuccessfully tries to confess to what has happened, but is accidentally interrupted by Christopher. Upon returning home, Dan is called away by Pastor Kingman, who tells him that he is needed in the church. This ends up being a ruse, as Pastor Kingsman then drugs and imprisons Dan shortly after his arrival.

Meanwhile, in the house, Mary awakens completely possessed and begins attacking the family. Wendy sends the remaining two children to find their father, who they discover to be seemingly unconscious on the church floor. With Noah's help they help him up and begin to drive home. On the way, they see that every house has a mark on their door, an X made out of blood. Frightened, Rebecca repeatedly asks Noah about the mark, only for him to refuse to answer her. The group arrives to the house where Dan and Rebecca try to go inside to get Wendy and Mary. Noah grabs ahold of Rebecca telling her to stay out there and that there's nothing she can do to help them. Dan proceeds inside to find Wendy dead and crumbling away on the couch. Dan stumbles back in fear where he sees Mary crawling towards him on the stairway. Dan runs out of the house screaming at Rebecca and Noah to start the car and drive away. 

They do so and Dan stays behind to try to free Mary, who has followed Dan out to the front yard, only to meet the same fate his wife did. Rebecca makes Noah stop the car and argues with him about what is going on. Christopher sees Mary is coming up behind them as Noah tries to explain what is happening to Rebecca. Christopher, frightened, runs out of the car to a nearby house and frantically starts banging on the door asking for help. Noah then shoves Rebecca back into the car leaving Christopher behind. Christopher finds a house and manages to get inside, but not before Mary grabs his leg and infects

Noah then takes Rebecca to a gathering where they use her blood to destroy the Devil (Mary) and close the Gateway to Hell. The viewer then learns that the same thing happened to Noah and his family some years ago. Rebecca then takes Noah's place and is later seen killing a sheep, which attracts the attention of a new boy whose family is moving into the town.

==Production==
Plans to film ''Nothing Left to Fear'' were first announced in 2010, when Slash announced his intent to launch his production company Slasher Films with ''Nothing Left to Fear'' as its flagship film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slash Slashing His Way into Horror Filmdom with Slasher Films |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/40202/slash-slashing-his-way-horror-filmdom-slasher-films#axzz2nWKrS31Y|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> [[Thomas Haden Church]] was initially named as one of the stars of the film,<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Haden Church Has Nothing to Fear|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/47090/thomas-haden-church-has-nothing-fear#axzz2nWKrS31Y|publisher=Dead Central|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> but his name was later removed from the production for unspecified reasons.<ref name="cast">{{cite web|title=Clancy Brown, Ethan Peck Join Nothing to Fear|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/165417-clancy-brown-ethan-peck-join-nothing-to-fear/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> [[Clancy Brown]] and [[Ethan Peck]] were added to the cast in early 2012, joining [[Anne Heche]] and [[James Tupper]].<ref name="cast" /> Filming began on May 14, 2012 in [[Covington, Louisiana]] and film rights for ''Nothing Left to Fear'' were purchased by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nothing to Fear Begins Filming; Full Cast Announced|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55744/nothing-fear-begins-filming-full-cast-announed#axzz2nWKrS31Y|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> Subsequent to production the film's screenplay credits were determined in arbitration by the Writers Guild of America - it was found that the original screenplay by Jonathan W.C. Mills had been extensively re-rewritten by producer Rob Eric. While not uncommon in Hollywood, the original draft of the screenplay was quite different than the final produced version. <ref name="Jonathan WC Mills"

==Soundtrack==
An official soundtrack was released for ''Nothing Left to Fear'' on October 31, 2013, to coincide with the world release of the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nothing Left To Fear Soundtrack|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/slash|publisher=Pledge Music|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> 

The music was written and produced by Slash and Nicholas O'Toole.
