==Reception==
===Critical response===
Stephen Dalton of ''[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]'' wrote in his review: " A good slasher film is not about originality or realism, of course, but about execution â€“ no pun intended. As such, director [[Menhaj Huda]] does a decent job with limited ingredients. But there is nothing in this pulpy, formulaic nerve-jangler that horror fans will not have seen countless times before."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film-review-comedown-1.452713|title=Film review: Comedown|first=Stephen|last=Dalton|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|publisher=International Media Investments|location=[[Abu Dhabi]]|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=14 May 2018}}</ref>
