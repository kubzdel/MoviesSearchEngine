'''''Hantu Jeruk Purut''''' ('''''Ghost of Jeruk Purut''''') is a 2006 Indonesian [[horror film]] directed by Koya Pagayo and starring Angie, Sheila Marcia Joseph, and Samuel Z Heckenbucker. It tells the story of an aspiring writer who is haunted by the ghost she is investigating.

==Plot==
Anna, a mystery writer, goes to [[Jeruk Purut Cemetery]] to look for information about the cemetery's legendary ghost, the headless pastor. After she begins writing, she is haunted by the pastor. Fearing for her life, she gives her notes to her fan, the high school student Airin (Angie); not long afterwards she is killed.

Airin sees Anna's writing as her road to becoming a famous writer herself, and goes to Jeruk Purut with her friends Nadine (Sheila Marcia Joseph) and Valen (Samuel Z Heckenbucker) to find the ghost. After circling the cemetery seven times, an act thought to call the ghost, they go home. Not long afterwards, Airin is visited by the ghost, who warns her that if she continues Anna's writing then she and her friends and family will suffer; Airin chooses to continue writing about the ghost.

Soon Airin's mother and friends begin experiencing accidents. Nadine is hit on the head by an exploding gas cylinder, while Valen is chased by a [[kuntilanak]] named Lasmi, eventually running into electric wires. While Airin is paying her respects to him in the hospital with Nadine and Cessa (Valia Rahma), Nadine becomes possessed by the ghost, knocks Cessa out, and attempts to strangle Airin. Airin escapes and runs into the morgue, with the possessed Nadine following her. Nadine is stabbed in the chest by Cessa just before she can kill Airin, dying; however, the ghost still attempts to kill Airin.

Airin eventually learns the truth. Years before, a young man had attempted to rape Lasmi, the servant of a pastor; when the pastor tried to stop it, the man killed both him and Lasmi. The man then put on the pastor's clothes to fool the locals but was eventually caught and [[decapitate]]d, later becoming a ghost.

==Production==
The story for ''Hantu Jeruk Purut'' was inspired by the "Hantu Jeruk Purut" [[urban legend]] in [[South Jakarta]], which had circulated for several decades. The urban legend deals with sightings of a headless ghost around Jeruk Purut cemetery.{{sfn|The Jakarta Post 2010, Ghost tales underline}} The legend holds that the ghost only reveals itself to odd-numbered groups of people.{{sfn|Sembiring and Siregar 2009, Spirits in the night}}

Before production, the cast and crew went to Jeruk Purut to request the ghost's permission to shoot the film.{{sfn|Hasan 2006, Izin Produksi Film}} While at the cemetery, two of those present, an actress named Yuni and a reporter from [[Trans 7|TV7]], fainted.{{sfn|Hasan 2006, Izin Produksi Film}} After they were diagnosed by a local ''[[kyai]]'' as having been possessed, those present attempted to communicate with the spirit.{{sfn|Hasan 2006, Izin Produksi Film}} Receiving no response, the ''kyai'' told the crew to offer cigars, chicken eggs, [[palm sugar]], and coffee to the spirits in glass containers before commencing filming.{{sfn|Hasan 2006, Izin Produksi Film}}

Filming took place in numerous locations in [[Jakarta]] and [[Jabodetabek|the surrounding area]], including an abandoned hospital and houses.{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}} According to Joseph, while filming she experienced several strange happenings.{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}} She recalled that she and Angie saw the spirit of a child appear suddenly while filming in Ciawi, [[Bogor]].{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}} While drawing the scissors to film the stabbing scene, Joseph lost control and released them; the scissors flew and struck Angie on the left [[Temple (anatomy)|temple]].{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}} 

''Hantu Jeruk Purut'' was Joseph's first horror film.{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}} She later commented that it was extremely tiring.{{sfn|Dwita 2006, Hantu Jeruk Purut}}
