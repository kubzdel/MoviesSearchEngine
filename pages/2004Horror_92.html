'''Rottweiler''' is a 2004 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Brian Yuzna]] and starring [[Paulina Gálvez (actress)|Paulina Gálvez]], [[Paul Naschy]] and [[Ivana Baquero]].

== Plot ==
In the near future (2018), a prisoner named Dante (William Miller) escapes from jail after having been arrested for illegally entering Spain. Forced to kill a prison guard, he is hunted down by the prison's dog, a monstrous [[Rottweiler]] [[police dog]] that sadistic prison warden Kufard (Paul Naschy) had revived and cybernetically enhanced after a fatal injury. Believing his Spanish girlfriend Ula (Irene Montala) was sent to work as a prostitute in Puerto Angel as punishment, Dante looks for her, but is exhausted by the chase and wounded by the Rottweiler. As a result, he starts having hallucinations and being haunted by the repressed memories of his and Ula's arrest. As he reaches Puerto Angel and can't find her at the brothel, he finally remembers that Ula got killed when Kufard let his dog loose on her, which led Dante to beat the dog to near death with a pipe, who was then turned into a cyborg. Dante kills Kufard as the Rottweiler catches up with him, and they fight to the death among the burning remains of Kufard's [[helicopter]]. The morning after, firemen find the skeletons of Dante, Ula and the Rottweiler on the beach.

== Critical reception ==
[[AllRovi|Allmovie]] called the film "a killer cyborg dog flick that's filled with more sleeping pills than chilling thrills" and "an obvious misstep for Yunza [''[[sic]]''], whose past successes are fastly fading in time. Do yourself a favor and leave this dog bone of a mess alone – you'll be happy that you did."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/rottweiler-v326556/review |title=Rottweiler (2004) |author=Jeremy Wheeler |work=[[AllRovi|Allmovie]] |accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>
