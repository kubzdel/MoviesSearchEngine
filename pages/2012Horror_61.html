When strange occurrences started to occur from dead bodies disappearing to possessed passengers started killing each other until Gift, Jamras, Phen, Bank and New are the only ones left. Phen is possessed and strangles New but a cart rolls and kills Phen with forks. Bank and Jamras drove and landed the plane safely.
