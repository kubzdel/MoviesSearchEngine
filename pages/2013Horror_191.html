== Plot ==
Four isolated astronauts in the lunar mining base ''Ark'' suffer a meteor storm. While inspecting the damage caused by the meteors, astronaut Ava Cameron discovers spores contained in one of the fragments and brings them back to the base for investigation. The medical officer discovers that these spores can grow rapidly, and in the process Ava is contaminated with them. Shortly afterward, Ava shows evident signs of a rapidly progressing pregnancy and, a few hours later, she goes into labour. The life form escapes the lab, and none of the others believe Ava's stories; they instead attribute her pregnancy to a cyst.  The alien stalks crew member Johns, eventually taking his shape and killing him.  Using notes posthumously left by Johns, Ava and Col. Brauchman attempt to kill the alien before it can kill them.  Eventually, Ava and Brauchman prepare to abandon the base in an escape pod, but it is hijacked by the alien. Ava and Brauchman, having expended most of the base's remaining power to ready the escape pod, are resigned to their fates until a rescue ship arrives from Earth. Brauchman sends a message to Earth from the rescue ship, warning them to kill whatever they discover in the escape pod, but it's revealed that the alien has escaped.
