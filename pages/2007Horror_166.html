'''''One Night in One City''''', also known as ''One Night in a City'' and ''One Night in the City'' ({{lang-cs|Jedné noci v jednom městě}}) is a [[stop motion|stop-motion-animated]] [[feature film|feature-length]] [[black comedy]] [[horror film]] from the [[Czech Republic]].  It was released theatrically in its home country on 25 January 2007 and features only incomprehensible mumblings instead of dialogue, much like the earlier animated feature ''[[Krysar]]''.

The film was made with the help of the Czech government; it got a grant of [[Czech koruna|Kc]] 1.875 million (~US$100,000) in 1998, the largest grant given to an animated production for that year.<ref>[http://www.obs.coe.int/oea_publ/eurocine/00002542.pdf Report on the State of the Czech Cinematography in 1998]</ref>  It was produced by [[MAUR Film]], which was previously responsible for two award-winning Czech feature films (also puppet-animated), ''[[Fimfárum]]'' and ''[[Fimfárum 2]]''.  The film participated in the "Forum for European Animation Films" in March 2007. [http://www.cartoon-media.be/MOVIE/6_Projects.htm]
