'''''Below''''' is a 2002 American [[World War II]] [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[horror film]] directed by [[David Twohy]], written by [[Darren Aronofsky]], Lucas Sussman, and Twohy, and stars [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Olivia Williams]], [[Matthew Davis]], [[Holt McCallany]], [[Scott Foley]], [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Jason Flemyng]], and [[Dexter Fletcher]]. The film tells the story of a [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]] that experiences a series of supernatural events while on patrol in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1943.

''Below'' was filmed on location in [[Lake Michigan]] for exteriors (using the World War II-era U.S. Navy submarine {{USS|Silversides|SS-236|6}}) and at [[Pinewood Studios]]. The film was released theatrically on October 11, 2002 to mixed reviews from critics.

==Plot==
USS ''Tiger Shark'' is a U.S. Navy submarine on patrol in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II in August 1943. She receives orders to pick up survivors spotted adrift by a British [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]] patrol plane. She retrieves three survivors &ndash; the British nurse Claire Paige ([[Olivia Williams]]) and two men, one of them wounded &ndash; from the British [[hospital ship]] ''Fort James'', which had been sunk two days earlier; one of the survivors blames the sinking on a German [[U-boat]] that he briefly saw on the surface just before ''Fort James'' suffered a [[torpedo]] hit. As they pick up the survivors, the crew of ''Tiger Shark'' spots a German [[destroyer]] bearing down on them. The submarine has several encounters with the German destroyer and suffers damage from [[depth charge]]s in the process. Later, the commanding officer of ''Tiger Shark'', Lieutenant Brice ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), discovers that the wounded survivor is actually a German [[prisoner-of-war]], Bernhard Schillings ([[Jonathan Hartman]]). Brice confronts him because he thinks Schillings has been making noises to betray ''Tiger Shark''{{'}}s position to the German warship.  Brice shoots Schillings dead when the German panics and grabs a [[scalpel]] to defend himself.

Brice reveals to Paige that ''Tiger Shark'' had sunk a German [[submarine tender]] recently and that her previous commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Winters ([[Nick Hobbs]]), had died after ''Tiger Shark'' surfaced to confirm the sinking. According to Brice, Winters was using a [[boathook]] to try to obtain a souvenir from the [[flotsam]] left behind by the sunken German ship when ''Tiger Shark'' struck a submerged object, causing Winters to hit his head while reaching for his souvenir, fall overboard, and drown before he could be rescued. Brice then assumed command of ''Tiger Shark''.

Soon after the death of the German prisoner, those aboard ''Tiger Shark'' begin to hear disembodied voices and experience other eerie events. While working in one of ''Tiger Shark''{{'}}s [[ballast tank]]s, two of the submarine's officers, Lieutenant Steven Coors ([[Scott Foley]]) and Ensign Douglas Odell ([[Matthew Davis]]) have a conversation in which Odell questions the story about Winters hitting his head and falling overboard after ''Tiger Shark'' struck a submerged object, saying that he had felt no such impact. Coors tells Odell that the real story of Winters' death is darker. Winters, on deck with only Brice, Coors, and Lieutenant Paul Loomis ([[Holt McCallany]]), had ordered them to have a gunnery party come on deck to machine-gun the survivors of the sunken German ship in the water. When Brice, Loomis, and Coors objected, a heated argument had broken out and escalated into a physical altercation during which Winters hit his head and fell overboard. In order to protect Winters' reputation, Coors asks Odell not to tell anyone. Before they leave the ballast tank, Coors dies in a mysterious accident. Soon afterwards, Loomis sees Winters' ghost aboard ''Tiger Shark''. He escapes from the submarine via an [[escape trunk]] while the submarine is underwater, and dies when he is impaled on an outside railing. 

A series of bizarre mechanical problems causes the crew of ''Tiger Shark'' to lose control of the submarine, and the submarine turns back towards the site of her sinking of the German ship, apparently of her own volition. Meanwhile, crewmen die in accidents at an alarming rate.  The eerie phenomena seem related to the death of Winters, and the crew begins to suspect a supernatural influence is behind all of ''Tiger Shark''{{'}}s mishaps and to question Brice's version of how and why Winters died.

Paige and Odell discover that ''Tiger Shark'' mistook ''Fort James'' for the German submarine tender and sank ''Fort James'' instead; they also learn that Brice, Loomis, and Coors believed that they could not afford this drastic mistake to appear on their records and conspired to suppress the story, killing Winters on the [[Deck (ship)|deck]] of ''Tiger Shark'' as he tried to save the survivors of ''Fort James''. 

''Tiger Shark'' ultimately is crippled by a mounting number of accidents, and only five of those aboard remain alive: Brice, Odell, Paige, Stumbo ([[Jason Flemyng]]), and "Weird" Wally ([[Zach Galifianakis]]). Wally concludes that ''Tiger Shark'' is haunted by a "malediction" that must be satisfied in order to escape its netherworld between heaven and hell. After ''Tiger Shark'' arrives at the location of the sinking of ''Fort James'', she surfaces in a disabled condition and those aboard her detect a [[Surface combatant|surface ship]] nearby. Brice prevents the surviving crew of ''Tiger Shark'' from radioing the nearby ship, but Paige sneaks out on deck and tries to signal the ship with a flashlight. Brice confronts her and holds her at gunpoint. His remorse over the accident overcomes him; he admits the entire cover-up to Paige and then shoots himself in the head, falling dead into the ocean.

The ship Paige is signaling turns out to be British and picks up the four survivors of ''Tiger Shark''. As they look on, ''Tiger Shark'' sinks, coming to rest on the ocean floor next to the wreck of ''Fort James''.
