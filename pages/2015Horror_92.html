==Plot==
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS -->
16-year-old Zach Cooper and his mother Gale Cooper move from New York City, New York to the town of Madison, Delaware after the recent death of Zach's father. While trying to settle into the new neighborhood, Zach meets a girl his age named Hannah and her overprotective father 'Mr. Shivers'. Zach and Hannah become quick friends, but Mr. Shivers frequently warns Zach to avoid contact with them. At Madison High School where Gale works as the vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a socially awkward student.

The following day as Zach is taking out the trash, Hannah appears behind him giving him a fright. When Zach inquires why he did not see Hannah at school she replies that she is home schooled by her father. Hannah then takes Zach to an abandoned amusement park where the two climb the ferris wheel to Zach's dismay. The two bond in one of the carriages before returning home where they are discovered by Hannah's father. Mr. Shivers warns Zach once again to stay away or something very bad will happen before disappearing behind the fence. Later that same night, Zach hears Mr. Shivers and Hannah arguing, followed by Hannah screaming and something crashing. Zach calls the police, but Mr. Shivers assures the officers that the noise came from his television. Zach returns home with his mother who leaves shortly after, to go to the school's Homecoming Dance, leaving Zach home alone with his Aunt Lorraine. Fearing Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks Mr. Shivers into going to the police station for further questioning and breaks into his house with Champ's help through the basement. The two then enter the Mr. Shiver's study where they find a shelf containing numerous ''[[Goosebumps]]'' manuscripts—all locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach unlocks one of the books, but when Hannah discovers them, Zach drops it and releases the snowman from ''The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena''. They pursue the monster to an ice skating rink, where they attempt to trap the snowman back in the book. As the trio are eventually corned in one of the boxes without the manuscript, Mr. Shivers appears behind the snowman and imprisons it back into the book.

On the way home, Mr. Shivers unintentionally reveals that he is ''Goosebumps'' author [[R.L. Stine]]. Once they return home he tells Hannah to pack up her things because they are moving away once again. Upon Zach's insistence, Stine explains how he created the stories as a child to terrorize the people that made fun of him, but the monsters came to life and became uncontrollable, so he trapped them in the manuscripts. Returning to the study, they find an angered [[Slappy the Dummy|Slappy]], from ''Night of the Living Dummy'', waiting for them. Slappy burns his own manuscript as revenge for imprisonment and flees with all of the manuscripts intent on releasing all of the monsters, escaping in the Haunted Car from the book of the same name, after having released it. The group is attacked by living [[Garden gnome|lawn gnomes]] from ''Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes'', but when Stine and the kids try to smash them, each of the gnomes reform. They realize that they can only run away.

Slappy rampages Madison in the Haunted Car, releasing several more monsters: mutant plants from ''Stay Out of the Basement'' destroy the cell phone towers, isolating the town, while the vampire poodle from ''Please Don't Feed the Vampire!'' attacks Zach's aunt Lorraine, and the Body Squeezers from ''Invasion of the Body Squeezers'' freeze the police station and the officers. Zach implores Stine to write a new book that can trap every monster, but he can only do it with a supernatural [[Smith Corona]] typewriter, on display at the high school. En route, Brent Green, from ''My Best Friend is Invisible'', and the giant praying mantis, from ''A Shocker on Shock Street'', attack Stine's car, forcing them into hiding in a supermarket. Will Blake, the werewolf from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' pursues them to the back loading dock of the supermarket, only to be run over by Lorraine (who has survived) into one of the dumpsters. Stine and Lorraine share a moment where the two show a romantic interest in each other, before Zach inquires Lorraine to notify the police at the police station.

At the police station, Lorraine attempts to notify the police of the group's whereabouts but finds the station empty. After trying to use one of the radios to get in contact with any officers, Slappy appears mockingly in police attire indicating how he has taken over the entire police station. A frightened Lorraine is soon frozen by the Body Squeezers after calling Slappy a dummy.

The group cuts through a graveyard where Zach notices that Hannah glows blue under moonlight before they are attacked by ghouls from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls''. After escaping the graveyard, the group arrives at the school where Zach privately questions Stine about whether Hannah knows she is another character. He reveals that she is in fact Hannah Fairchild from ''The Ghost Next Door''. Stine created her to cope with his loneliness even though she does not know it, and doesn't expect Zach to understand his intention. Zach then reveals that he does understand with him losing his father. The two then share a moment before Hannah then appears telling them how they found the typewriter. Stine acquires the typewriter and starts writing a new story based on the events around them, while Slappy releases the rest of the ''Goosebumps '' monsters (including the Haunted Mask, Prince Khor-Ru, the Swamp Monster, the Creeps, Nila Rahmad, the Scarecrows, Count Nightwing and many more) outside on the school football field. Zach tries to warn the students about the events going on outside before the praying mantis attacks the school frightening the students. Slappy then rallies all of the monsters to attack the school together in order to get to Stine and stop him, while Zach leads the students in fending off all the released monsters storming the building. Bees from ''Why I'm Afraid of Bees'' attacks Zach in the library but he manages to defeat them. Meanwhile, the monsters finally enter the school with help of the Annihilator 3000 from ''Toy Terror: Batteries Included''. Slappy soon finds and confronts Stine, breaking his fingers with the typewriter case before the story is finished.

As the students and staff at the high school continue to fend the ''Goosebumps'' monsters off, the group boards a school bus and head to the abandoned amusement park. The monsters follow in pursuit and catch up with the school bus and tip it over on it's side. However it is revealed to be a decoy with the group watching safely from another bus waiting for their plan to work. Upon opening the doors, the school bus explodes and temporarily destroys the monsters giving the group more time to escape. At the amusement park, the group take refuge in the fun house where Zach continues to type the story as Stine is telling it to him. Slappy soon tracks them and after revealing how he and Stine are the same persona, releases the blob from ''The Blob that Ate Everyone''. Stine hands the book and typewriter to Zach and distracts the blob by allowing it to devour him. The group then climbs to the top of the ferris wheel where Zach finishes the story. However, when Slappy notices the book is not with Stine, he has the monsters attack the ferris wheel making it come off of its hinges and roll violently out of the park. As the group climbs out, Hannah insists Zach to open the book but Zach is reluctant to open the book because Hannah will also be sucked inside it. Revealing she knew the truth about herself all along, Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the other ''Goosebumps'' monsters into it; she bids farewell to Zach with a kiss before she is also sucked in.

Months later, Stine is revealed as the new substitute English teacher and how he is now dating Lorraine. After class, as Zach reminisces about Hannah to Stine, Stine reveals Hannah in the hallway. Stine explains to Zach that he wrote her back into existence with one more book. Hannah and Zach kiss and leave school together while Stine burns Hannah's manuscript, making her permanently real. As Stine is about to leave school, he hears the click of the typewriter typing by itself inside its display case. Much to his horror, Brent Green has evaded imprisonment and begins to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book titled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.

==Production==

===Development===
The first attempt at a ''Goosebumps'' film, in 1998, was set to be produced by [[Tim Burton]]. [[Chris Meledandri]], the president of Fox Family Films at the time, said, "I think you'll see us tackling a scale of story that would be prohibitive to do on the small screen".<ref name="Weekly">{{cite web |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,281459,00.html |title=Between The Lines |date=January 9, 1998 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref> However, the film did not materialize since they could not find a script they liked or determine which book or monster to adapt.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thewrap.com/goosebumps-rl-stine-tim-burton-stephen-king/ | title='Goosebumps' Author R.L.

The duo decided against adapting any one book in the series, feeling the individual books in the series were too short. Thinking of ways to create a universe where all the creatures in the books could live together, they elected to do a fake [[biographical film]] where R. L.

Slappy even brought some of his "friends" out consisting of the Bog Monster from ''How to Kill a Monster'', two Graveyard Ghouls from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls'', Cronby the Troll and a Mulgani from ''Deep in the Jungle of Doom'', the Lord High Executioner from ''A Night in Terror Tower'', Murder the Clown from ''A Nightmare on Clown Street'', the Mummy of Prince Khor-Ru from ''Return of the Mummy'', Captain Long Ben One-Leg from ''Creep from the Deep'', Professor Shock from ''The Creepy Creations of Professor Shock'', Count Nightwing from ''Vampire Breath'', a Creep from ''Calling All Creeps!'', a Body Squeezer from ''Invasion of the Body Squeezers: Part 1'' and ''Part 2'', Carly Beth Caldwell's Haunted Mask form from ''The Haunted Mask'', a Scarecrow from ''The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight'', and a Pumpkin Head from ''Attack of the Jack-O'-Lanterns''. When Jack Black tells Slappy that it is him that Slappy wants, Slappy instructs the Lord High Executioner, Murder the Clown, and Professor Shock to take Jack Black outside to his car. As the monsters leave, Slappy tells Rob some of his pitches causing Rob to leave as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comiccon2016.sched.org/event/7hKk/goosebumps|title=Comic-Con 2016: Goosebumps|website=Sched.org|access-date=February 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrEdGjXHqN4|title=Jack Black Goosebumps Panel SDCC 2014|first=|last=thejellybat|date=July 30, 2014|publisher=|access-date=February 7, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Some monsters due for an appearance in the film were cut for budgetary reasons, but Letterman stated that the crew tried to choose the monsters most appropriate to the story.

Kevin P.
