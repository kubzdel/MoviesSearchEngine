The anthology stars [[Domiziano Arcangeli]], [[Corbin Bleu]], and [[Bill Oberst Jr.]], and is composed of five interlocking stories set within the city of [[Los Angeles]].

==Synopsis==
===The Crossing===
Buck ([[Bill Oberst Jr.]]) and his friends have made a pastime of trolling the [[Mexico-United States border]] in search of anyone they believe to be an illegal immigrant. Upon catching someone, the group murders them and buries the body in the hopes of sending out a personal message to anyone else that wants to enter. However what they couldn't predict is that their victims might rise from the grave to take their revenge.

===TaeJung's Lament===
A lonely widower finds himself unable to cope with the loss of his wife and begins to follow around various women that resemble her. On one such occasion he ends up becoming a witness to a woman's kidnapping. The man rescues her and in gratitude, the woman urges him to meet her one night. Unknown to him, the woman and her friends are all vampires who are being hunted by [[Van Helsing]] himself.

===Re-Membered===
A dirty cop (Christopher Darga) has been asked to serve as a hitman for a man's murder, which he does. He dismembers the body and stows it in his trunk for later disposal, but is shocked when he begins to find evidence that his victim is somehow still alive. 

===Clowned===
When Emmett ([[Corbin Bleu]]), a wayward drug dealer, gets bitten by Fucko ([[Domiziano Arcangeli]]), a flesh-eating clown at a family member's birthday party, the last thing he expects is for that bite to begin a horrifying transformation. As his transformation proceeds, Emmett is horrified to find that he has a newly acquired taste for human flesh.

===Lover Come Back===
A woman returns from the grave in order to seek revenge on the cheating husband who caused her death. As she moves towards her final task, she begins to recollect their relationship and how everything went wrong.
