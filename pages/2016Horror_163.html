==Plot==
In 1969 during the [[Summer of Love]], John and Mary, a married couple sleeping in bed, are awaken in the middle of the night by knocks on their doors and windows. John goes downstairs to investigate but finds nothing. As he gets back into bed, he hears a crash downstairs. He sees the shadow of a man saying "Little Pig". As he runs back to his room to his wife, he locks the door. After calling the police, the intruders break open the door. Later, the intruders write messages in blood on the walls of the house, but leave before Detective Clarkin and the police arrive at the scene.

The following night, [[Sharon Tate|Sharon]], [[Jay Sebring|Jay]], [[Wojciech Frykowski|Wojciech]], and [[Abigail Folger|Abigail]] commemorate Abigail’s upcoming move back to Boston with a celebratory dinner at [[El Coyote Cafe|El Coyote]] in [[Hollywood]], even though Wojciech is upset that Abby is allowing her parents to influence her decision. After dinner, the four friends return to Sharon’s house for the evening. A pregnant Sharon calls her husband from the nursery, but suddenly the line goes dead. Meanwhile, [[Steven Parent|Steven]] arrives at the property to see his friend William, who lives in the guesthouse. After selling William a stereo, Steven tries to leave, only to find the driveway gate disabled. He gets out and opens the gate, but his vehicle turns off unexpectedly. As he returns to his vehicle, he turns his headlights on to see a man standing in front of his truck and a woman standing behind his truck. He is then pulled out of the vehicle and stabbed to death. Wojciech goes outside to have a cigarette. As he approaches the truck in the driveway, he sees a man slumped over. He asked the man if he is alright, but the man lunges at him and chases him to the front door which is locked. Wojciech is suddenly stabbed and his attackers drag his body back to the house and put him in the shower. Later, the intruders write the word "Pig" in blood on the front door.

In her bedroom, Sharon and Abigail become concerned when they observe a strange girl prowling the premises. Jay is stabbed to death while sleeping on the couch. The two women hear Jay screaming and moaning and investigate. They discover his dead body and realize they are under attack. They try to hide throughout the house as the intruders stalk them. While Abigail fights with an intruder, Sharon hides in the bathroom and finds Wojciech, who is still alive. An attacker breaks down the door to capture both Sharon and Wojciech. Sharon and Wojciech are seen dragged through the hallway as Abigail escapes the house. She tries to get help from William, but he is unable to hear because of his music. One of the intruders catches Abigail and carries her to the house. She is taken back to a bedroom where Sharon and Wojciech are also being held. An intruder enters the bedroom and drags Sharon away. Wojciech and Abigail fight their way outside, but Wojciech is stabbed to death on the lawn. An injured Abigail makes it to the street to flag down a car, but finds it is occupied by two of the intruders. She falls to the ground, gazing at the locket Sharon gave to her, as the two intruders approach her with a bloody sledgehammer.

The film ends with a series of interviews of [[Charles Manson]] and the attackers.
