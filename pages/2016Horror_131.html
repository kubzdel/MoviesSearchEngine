==Production==
Armstrong describes ''Sheborg Massacre'' as a neo-pulp film.
"Neo-pulp lovingly embraces the most extreme, cliche, and supercilious elements of pop culture and pulp literature and puts them in a human context. SHEBORG MASSACRE itself is a 50s teen rebel flick set in a B grade sci-fi world from the early 80s, with horror style violence. It’s not a spoof, it’s not horror, it’s not action, it’s not sci-fi, it’s not drama. It’s all of these things. It’s neo-pulp."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmink.com.au/notices/11731/ |title=Australia's Best Film Magazine |publisher=FilmInk |date=2015-11-01 |accessdate=2015-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127015236/http://www.filmink.com.au/notices/11731/ |archivedate=27 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
