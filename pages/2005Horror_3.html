{{More plot|date=December 2015}}
In a small Mexican town, Vargas Diaz uncovers a hidden Aztec temple deep in the nearby mine. Luring the townspeople in, he blows up the entrance, trapping those inside forever. In exchange for the sacrificing the townspeople, Vargas receives eternal life.

Years later, a college couple vacationing in Mexico comes across the town, empty of people. After accidentally running into what appears to be a funeral procession, they uncover the deadly truth of the town's past. Every year on the [[Day of the Dead]] a human sacrifice is presented at the local church to appease the spirits of the town's original inhabitants; however, this year the couple interferes with their sacrifice. With nothing to appease the dead, they return to kill the transgressors.

Calling two of their friends for help, the four are left to fight off the growing hordes of the undead besieging their hotel, while trying to uncover the secrets hiding within the hotel's rooms.
