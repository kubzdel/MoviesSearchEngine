==Plot==
The story revolves in the background of Mount Academy School, where three girls, Gowri and two others were found dead. The deaths seemed to be suicide. After some time, all the people in the school return to a normal stage.

A girl, Parvathy, newly joins the school who is the niece of Sreekanth, the Commissioner of Police, who is probing the death case. Parvathy lives in the same room where Gowri lived. After some days, the vengeful spirit of Gowri appears in front of Parvathy, to help her to take revenge from the people who killed her. Parvathy becomes friendly to the spirit soon.

Now  Gowri starts telling her story how she had doting parents, best friends and a peaceful life. All this was interrupted when Aloshy, the dance teacher of the three dead girls, takes naked pictures through hidden cameras. Aloshy, at several occasions, blackmailed these girls to leak these pictures in the internet. The girls are frightened now as Aloshy always wanted to have sex with these girls.

One fine day, these girls are about to reveal everything to the teachers, but Aloshy and his lover kill these girls. The two girls were dead, but Gowri didn't die instantly. He pours more of the poison in Gowri's mouth, and finally kills her.

In the meanwhile, Parvathy starts to behave like Gowri, which turns everybody in horror. They call an exorcist, who says that Gowri's vengeful spirit has entered Parvathy's body.
  
Gowri, years after her death, is back to kill Aloshy and his lover. She succeeds in killing both of them. Gowri puts fire in Aloshy's lover's room and kills her, turning her body beyond recognition, and she pushes off Aloshy from the terrace of his house and kills him.

Gowri's spirit now finds peace and bades goodbye to Parvathy, leaving her sad.
