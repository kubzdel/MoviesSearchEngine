==Plot==
A teenage girl who loves horror movies watches them all the time, yet is never frightened.  Despite never being frightened, she begins to sleepwalk out of her house, resulting in her parents getting angry.  They forbid her to watch any more horror movies in an attempt to prevent her sleepwalking, however there's a new movie called "The Wisher" out which is a huge hit with all her friends.  Her father tells her she's not allowed to see it, but she sneaks out anyway.  Before she leaves, she says "I wish he would just go away" and goes and sees the movie.  Surprisingly, a scene in the movie is too much for her and she leaves.  Her dad goes after her but then dies unexpectedly in a car accident. She then notices one of the characters in the movie following her around and whenever she makes a wish for something bad the wisher grants it.
