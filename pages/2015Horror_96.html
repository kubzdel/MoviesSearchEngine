==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from film critics. [[Frank Scheck]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote: "Unfortunately, despite its provocative premise, the film, which recently received its world premiere at SXSW, offers only sporadic moments of creepiness."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/hangman-film-review-785815|title='Hangman': Film Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Frank|last=Scheck|date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: "An effectively creepy spin on found-footage horror, ''Hangman'' finds a family unwittingly playing host to a malevolent intruder who's broken into their home – and stayed there, unseen, while watching their every move on surveillance cameras he's installed."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sxsw-film-review-hangman-1201455750/|title=SXSW Film Review: 'Hangman'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dennis|last=Harvey|date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>  Patrick Cooper of [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "''Hangman'' looks better than most found footage films. But the lack of characters to attach ourselves to, the drab killer, and the predictability really hamper what could've been an interesting little film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3338863/review-hangman/|title=[Review] Home Invasion Thriller ‘Hangman’ Underwhelms|last=Cooper|first=Patrcik|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=April 6, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>  Dominick Suzanne-Mayer of [[Consequence of Sound]] rated it C and wrote that  "you’ve seen this movie before, and you’ve absolutely seen better iterations".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/03/sxsw-film-review-hangman/|title=SXSW Film Review: Hangman|last=Suzanne-Mayer|first=Dominick|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=March 19, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>
