'''''The Ring''''' (stylized as '''''the ring''''') is a 2002 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Gore Verbinski]] and starring [[Naomi Watts]], [[Martin Henderson]], [[David Dorfman]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] and [[Daveigh Chase]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 1998 [[J-Horror|Japanese horror]] film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' based on [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|the novel of the same name]] by [[Koji Suzuki]].

''The Ring'' was released theatrically on October 18, 2002, and received mostly positive reviews. Many critics praised direction, screenplay, and reliance on dread and visuals over gore, but criticized the lack of character development. The film grossed over $249 million worldwide on a $48 million production budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror remakes. It is the first installment of the American [[The Ring (film series)|''Ring'' series]], and was followed by ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005) and ''[[Rings (2017 film)|Rings]]'' (2017).

''The Ring'' paved the way for western remakes of Asian horror films, such as ''[[The Grudge (2004 film)|The Grudge]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]'', ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]'', ''[[The Eye (2008 film)|The Eye]]'', ''[[Shutter (2008 film)|Shutter]]'', ''[[Mirrors (2008 film)|Mirrors]]'' and ''[[The Uninvited (2009 film)|The Uninvited]]''.

==Plot==
Teenagers Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a videotape; whoever watches it dies seven days later. Katie confesses that she watched the tape with her friends the previous week. That night, Katie is killed by an unseen force. 

At Katie's funeral, Katie's mother Ruth asks her sister Rachel, a [[Seattle]] journalist, to investigate the death. Rachel discovers that Katie's friends were killed in bizarre accidents on the night of her death. She also learns that Becca has been institutionalized after witnessing Katie's death. Rachel goes to Shelter Mountain Inn, the mountain retreat where Katie and her friends watched the tape. She rents the same cabin and watches the tape; it contains gruesome and disturbing imagery. After the tape ends, she receives a phone call from an unknown female who whispers "seven days".

Rachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-boyfriend Noah. He watches the tape and Rachel makes him a copy so they can both investigate where it came from. Rachel begins to see images from the tape appear in the real world. She discovers hidden imagery of a lighthouse and identifies a woman on the tape: a horse breeder, Anna Morgan, who committed suicide after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel finds their son, Aidan, watching the videotape.

Leaving Aidan in Ruth's care, Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower, Richard, while Noah travels to Eola Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. On the ferry to the island, a horse is spooked by Rachel and leaps to its death. On the island, she discovers Anna had an adopted daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara]], but Richard denies it. Rachel speaks to the island doctor, who explains that Anna adopted Samara due to her [[infertility]]. Samara possessed the ability to [[Thoughtography|psychically etch images]] onto objects and into minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Noah finds a psychiatric file on Samara which mentions a missing video record last seen by Richard.

Rachel sneaks into the Morgan house and watches the missing video, which shows Samara explaining her powers during a psychotherapy session. Richard discovers her and strikes her. Realizing Samara's evil is still at large, he electrocutes himself in the bathtub. Noah arrives and he and Rachel enter the barn. In a loft converted to a bedroom to isolate Samara from her mother, they find an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.

Rachel returns with Noah to the cabin at Shelter Mountain Inn, where they are led to a [[water well|well]] beneath the floorboards. They remove the lid and Rachel is pushed inside. A hand grabs her, and Rachel experiences a vision of Anna suffocating and dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for seven days. Samara's corpse surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued from the well, they arrange a proper burial for Samara. Noah tells Rachel that they are now safe as more than seven days have passed since she watched the videotape.

Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to try to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's seven days are up and rushes to save him, but the [[vengeful ghost]] of Samara materializes on his TV screen, crawls out of it and kills him. Rachel finds his disfigured corpse and returns home to destroy the tape. She concludes she was spared because she made a copy, which Aidan watched. Rachel has Aidan make a copy of the copy to show to someone else, saving him from Samara.

==Production==
''The Ring'' went into production without a completed script.<ref name=iwgv>{{cite web|url=http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php|title=Interview with Gore Verbinski|date=2002|publisher=curseofthering.com|accessdate=2 March 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302113145/http://www.curseofthering.com/gore.php| archive-date=2 March 2017}}</ref> [[Ehren Kruger]] wrote three drafts of the screenplay before [[Scott Frank]] came on to do an uncredited rewrite. Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of ''Ringu'' after [[Walter F. Parkes]] sent him a VHS copy of the original Japanese film, which he describes as "intriguing", "Pulp" and "avant-garde". The film also sought to retain the minimalism that was prevalent throughout ''Ringu'' and was decidedly set in [[Seattle]], due to its "wet and isolated" atmosphere. Verbinski also admitted to not wanting to cast "big stars" as he wanted his film to be "discovered" and describes the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as "inevitable" although he expressed desire for hardcore fans of the original to find the remake as equally compelling.<ref name=iwgv/>

==Soundtrack==
The film features an original score composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] (who would later collaborate on Gore Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the film's theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in an album that combined music from both ''The Ring'' and ''The Ring Two''.

==Marketing==
In order to advertise ''The Ring'', many promotional websites were formed featuring the characters and places in the film. The video from the cursed videotape was played in late night programming over the summer of 2002 without any reference to the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was financially successful, and the box office gross increased from its first weekend to its second.

===Critical reception===
''The Ring'' was met with generally positive reviews from film critics.

Despite the praise given to Verbinski's direction, critics described the characters as weak. The ''[[Chicago Reader]]'''s Jonathan Rosenbaum said that the film was "an utter waste of Watts… perhaps because the script didn't bother to give her a character",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.filmspot.com/movie/279209/the-ring/reviews/critic.html?tag=scorecard;more | publisher = The Chicago Reader | title = The Ring | accessdate = 2007-07-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234725/http://www.filmspot.com/movie/279209/the-ring/reviews/critic.html?tag=scorecard;more | archivedate = September 27, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> whereas other critics such as William Arnold from ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' said the opposite: "she projects intelligence, determination and resourcefulness that carry the movie nicely."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.filmspot.com/pages/tracking/index.php?tid=10&ref_id=279209 | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title = The Ring | accessdate = 2007-07-19 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many critics regarded Dorfman's character as a "creepy-child" "''[[The Sixth Sense|Sixth Sense]]'' cliché."<ref name="The Ring"/> A large sum of critics, like ''[[Miami Herald]]''{{'s}} Rene Rodriguez and ''[[USA Today]]''{{'s}} Claudia Puig<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.filmspot.com/pages/tracking/index.php?tid=16&ref_id=279209 | publisher = USA Today | title = 'Ring' has hang-up or two | accessdate = 2007-07-19 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> found themselves confused and thought that by the end of the movie "[the plot] still doesn't make much sense".

The film ranked number 20 on the [[Cable network|cable channel]] [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] list of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''. [[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film sixth in their list of the "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article saying that "The Ring was not only the first American 'J-Horror' remake out of the gate; it also still stands as the best."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18425|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 3|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref>
