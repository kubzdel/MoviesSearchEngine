'''''Squealer''''' is a 2005 [[Pornographic film|pornographic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Jack the Zipper]].

==Plot==
A quartet of women on a road trip experience car trouble, and seek shelter in a seemingly abandoned [[farmhouse]], where they have an orgy. The girls are interrupted mid-coitus by the home's owners, a group of [[hillbilly]] cousins who make the travellers have sex with them. Afterward, two of the women are tied to chairs and placed in a [[boathouse]], though one of them manages to free herself, and undo her companion's ropes. While those two have sex, they are spied on by three of the [[redneck]]s, who eventually join them.

Outside, one of the girls has been tied up and placed in the back of a truck. While her abductor digs a grave, the woman tries to make a run for it, but she is quickly recaptured. The girl is taken back to the house, where she and two of her friends (one of whom is placed in a [[sex swing|swing]]) are used for sex. Next, a female member of the backwoods clan has sex with one of the girls, choking her and suffocating her with a bag during the act.

Another orgy occurs, this time involving two men and two women, the latter being urinated on before the sex begins. After one of the hillbillies climaxes, the film abruptly ends, with the women presumably still being held prisoner in the farmhouse.

==Reception==
''[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]'' gave ''Squealer'' a four and a half out of five, stating: "it's unrelentingly filthy, full of dirt-streaked bodies, d.p.s, double anal, slapping, tying, gagging, spitting, [[asphyxiation]], you name it. It's also a masterpiece, porn's answer (in a true sense, not a parodic one) to ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''" and "The look, the mood, the music... it's all pitch-perfect. And unlike anyone else's stuff. Jack the Zipper has slaughtered again".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avn.com/movies/50326.html|title=''Squealer''|author=Peter Warren|publisher=''Adult Video News''|date=November 1, 2005|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> A positive review was also given by [[Fleshbot]], which described the film as "an intense little movie" that was spookily and artfully shot.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://straight.fleshbot.com/165747/dvd-review-squealer|title = DVD Review: ''Squealer''|author = Gram Ponante|publisher = Fleshbot|date = April 7, 2006|work = Squealer|accessdate = February 11, 2013}}</ref>

A two out of five was awarded by XCritic, which admitted that while the film succeeded at being atmospheric, artistic and creepy it was still "just plain repulsive" and "like something serial killers use to push them over the edge into orgasm land while fantasizing about slaughter".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.xcritic.com/review/17903/alec-knight-squealer/|title = ''Squealer''|author = Disco Dirge|publisher = XCritic|date = September 27, 2005|work = Squealer|accessdate = February 11, 2013}}</ref> Box Magazine was also critical of ''Squealer'', finding most of the sex unerotic, and the horror element almost non-existent.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://boxreviews.blogspot.ca/2006/07/jack-zippers-squealer-vca-pictures.html|title = Jack the Zipper's ''Squealer'': VCA Pictures|author = Z|publisher = Box Magazine|date = July 30, 2006|work = Squealer|accessdate = March 21, 2013}}</ref>
