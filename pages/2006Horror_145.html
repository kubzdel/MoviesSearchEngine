'''''The Plague''''' (also known as '''''Clive Barker's The Plague''''') is a 2006 [[horror film]] directed by Hal Masonberg and written by Masonberg and Teal Minton.  It was produced by [[Clive Barker]].

==Plot==
In 1983, simultaneously one day all of the world's children under the age of nine fall into a catatonic state. For the next ten years, every child who is born, is born in a state of [[catatonia]]. During this state, the children experience seizures twice a day and seem to develop [[superhuman strength]]. By 1993, all the children wake up, hellbent on killing all adults. Things get even worse when the adults realize the children have a sort of [[Group mind (science fiction)|collective brain]]—what one learns, they all learn. The children get smarter by the hour, first they dismantle the engines in almost every car and set up road blocks to stop the adults from escaping. Then they learn how to use firearms. The children also take the souls of the ones they kill as a part of deliverance. The adults must find a way to stop them before it's too late.

==Reception==
[[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, "But even as the premise of The Plague continues to titillate and intrigue, the film can’t quite deliver on its promise, rendering it slightly entertaining and ultimately forgettable."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109472/the-plague-v-2/|title=The Plague (V)|author=<!-- Staff -->|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2006-09-25|accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref>  Steve Barton of [[Dread Central]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, "Clive Barker may have in some way produced this mess and lent his name to it, but rest assured there’s nothing Barker-esque about it. All that's here is a giant missed opportunity which — pardon the really bad, yet fitting pun — you should avoid like the plague."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4305/plague-the-dvd/|title=Plague, The (DVD)|last=Barton|first=Steve|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2006-08-09|accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref>  Scott Weinberg of [[DVD Talk]] rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote that it does not live up the premise, instead "devolving into yet another (and very stale) zombie-type chase thriller".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/23204/plague-the/|title=The Plague|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2006-08-12|accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref>  David Johnson of [[DVD Verdict]] wrote, "''The Plague'' is an inscrutable movie that starts out strong, but loses forward momentum, eventually grinding to an awkward halt."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/barkersplague.php|title=Clive Barker's The Plague|last=Johnson|first=David|work=[[DVD Verdict]]|date=2006-09-05|accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref>
