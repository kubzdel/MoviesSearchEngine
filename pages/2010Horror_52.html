==Recognition==
A ''Denizen'' trailer screened at the [[Park City International Music Festival|Park City Music Film Festival]] in 2009,<ref name="parkcity"/> and when the ''Denizen'' film premiered at the [[Bare Bones International Film Festival]] in April 2010, it received a nomination for the 'Best [[Sci-Fi]] Feature'.<ref name="BFF"/>  ''Denizen'' also was the only film to screen at the [[LGBT]] 'Outlantacon Sci-Fi Convention'.<ref name="OUT"/>

Director and producer Jessica M. Bair won the 2009 Nevada Film Festival's 'Silver Screen Award' in the Short Film Competition, for the behind the scenes documentary ''Denizen: Special Access J.A. Steel''.<ref name="NFF"/>  The short film was shot during the post-production of the ''Denizen'' feature, with director J.A. Steel and sound editor Wayne Rawley providing a close-up view into the filmmaker who does her own stunts.<ref name="DoorQ"/>

In June 2010, ''Denizen'' was awarded the Bronze Medal for Excellence Award for the 'Best Impact of Music in a Feature Film', at the [[Park City International Music Festival|Park City Music Film Festival]].<ref name="parkcity2"/>

===Critical response===
The film has received attention for genre reviewers.  From the movie trailer in 2008, ''Cinema Fantastique'' (Belgium) noted that the cast is typical for a low-budget production, and that the effects for the creature may well make the viewer laugh.<ref name="CF"/>

Mike Catalano of [[JoBlo]] wrote "We have ourselves another low-budget, fromage-fest of horror coming our way. (In case you didn’t know, fromage means “cheese” in French)", offering "at the very least, it could make for some check-your-brain-at-the-door fun", and summarized by writing "there is an abundance of hot ladies in the cast, including a special appearance by none other than horror’s #1 vixen, [[Tiffany Shepis]]."<ref name="joblo">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/arrow/index.php?id=13702|title=Babes of ''Denizen''|last=Catalano|first=Mike|date=September 9, 2008|work=[[JoBlo]]|publisher=joblo.com|accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>

Nic Brown of ''B Movie Man'' wrote that [the film] "is a mix of action, horror and science fiction. It has plenty of gun play and a surprising array of stunts including deep water scuba shoots, sky diving, and some military fighter action," with "an array of interesting characters," and concluded that it was "a respectable independent action film with elements of sci-fi and horror thrown in."<ref name="BMM"/>

Nic Baisley of ''Film Snobbery'' wrote "The fairly wide variety of locations used in the movie also add that sense of realism to the story that is generally left out in some films. The use of multiple locations adds a lot of free production value to an otherwise obviously low-budget film. Other things in this film that should be given kudos are the action scenes, underwater filmed scenes, and even an unexpected aerial skydiving scene. J.A. Steel definitely knew how to take advantage of her limited budget on this shoot, and it certainly all ends up on the screen." and observed "All in all I can appreciate what Steel was trying to accomplish with 'Denizen'. I think that the overall broadness of a story like this is very hard to contain within a small-ish budget with an inexperienced cast and crew. With J.A.'s background as a martial artist you can definitely tell she shouldered a lot of the action scene burdens, as well as being in front of the camera for her role in the movie. When a director has to work in so many capacities, often the production suffers a little. At the end, 'Denizen' is a fun monster movie, despite any flaws that are inherent to {{sic|it's}} production."<ref name="filmsnobbery"/>

Scott Shoyer of ''Anything Horror'' praised the film's ambitious scope, campy dialogue and for not taking itself to seriously, but criticized the sound quality. Shoyer compared Denizen to films used by the television show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' due to its low-budget special effects and continuity errors. Shoyer concluded by saying that the film was not for everyone, but "if you're looking for some fun cinematic cheese done “indie-style” then you'll enjoy this one.  This is perfect to watch with a group of people and a lot of beer."<ref name="anythinghorror"/>

The horror film website ''Fatally Yours'' gave the film a negative review.  While praising J.A. Steele's performance as the only pleasurable part of the movie it states that it is "atrocious" and "nigh unwatchable" due to poor acting and editing.<ref>http://www.fatally-yours.com/horror-reviews/denizen-2010/</ref>

==DVD release==
The ''Denizen'' film DVD was officially released via IndieFlix on April 6, 2010.<ref name="28dayslater"/>  It was simultaneously released as [[Streaming media|streaming]] [[video on demand]].  On June 7, 2010, ''Denizen'' was released on [[Amazon.com]], in both DVD and video on demand.
