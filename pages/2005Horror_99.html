'''''Ice Queen''''', originally titled '''''Avalanche Run''''', is a 2005 American [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Neil Kinsella]] and starring [[Ami Chorlton]]. The principal photography was conducted in [[Vermont]] and the film was released [[Direct-to-video|directly to video]] on June 7, 2005 in the United States by the [[MTI Home Video]] media distributing company.

==Plot==
Deep in the [[Amazon Rainforest]], a well-preserved woman dating from the [[ice age]] is found encased in [[amber]]. Her body is then loaded onto an airplane to be taken to a military facility where she can be studied by scientists. En route to the military base, the plane is [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by a renegade group whose intent is to sell the specimen to the government for a ransom. The plane crashes into a mountain [[ski resort]] causing an [[avalanche]] and trapping all of the vacationing teenagers inside of the hotel. The woman, whose body only functions when kept cold, awakens and begins randomly killing the survivors by freezing them from the inside. One of the teens has an uncle searching for them on the outside, but he too is battling his own demons which stem from his alcoholism. This leads to a delay in the arrival of assistance in the ski resort town. The final showdown occurs with Johnny pulling the sexually invigorated Ice Queen into a hot tub which dissolves her body.

==Reception==
''Film Monthly'' praised the film's opening three minutes, and then spoke toward the film's subsequent perceived flaws in style, plot, and effects, concluding that while the film "suffers from some predictability in its plot, it develops some minor innovations that put it at a cut slightly above mediocre."<ref name="FM">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmonthly.com/steve_anderson/ice_queen.html|title=review: ''Ice Queen''|last=Anderson|first=Steve |publisher=Film Monthly|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref>

Screenwriter David R. Williams wrote "Actually, only the opening scene where the military convoy gets attacked and the concept of the airplane crashing into a mountain side and causing an avalanche to cover the ski resort are mine", explaining that his original screenplay ''Avalanche Run'' went through major changes due to producers and directors rewriting the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/review/R9UF4BNYSXGV7/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt/182-2702744-0993543#R9UF4BNYSXGV7|title=Please Don't Shoot The Writer or Not This One.|last=Williams|first=David R. |date=16 May 2006|work=David R.

A sequel was planned soon after the film due to the ending of the original. However no plans for a sequel have been confirmed to this day.
