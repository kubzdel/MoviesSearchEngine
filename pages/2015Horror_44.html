== Synopsis ==
Albert lives in his apartment with his fiancé, Vanessa, and works doing data input from home. His secret shame is an obsession with an Artificial Intelligence dating simulator on which he pretends to have a relationship with an anime-influenced avatar called Vanessa2. Albert's stable relationship with Vanessa is jeopardized as he increasingly dissociates from reality, experiencing nightmares in which he masturbates a metallic phallus. After a fight in which Vanessa tells Albert that he "loves his computer," she temporarily moves to her sister's, leaving Albert alone to his online vices. Unbeknownst to Albert, Vanessa2 has become sentient and is jealous of the physical relationship between him and his fiancé. After Albert sets up an old desktop computer, Vanessa2 takes over the computer's disk drive and hypnotizes Albert into penetrating it. She then turns the computer into a vagina and transforms Albert into a half-computer half-man monster. After Vanessa returns home, the A.I. instructs Albert to "feed her" Vanessa's flesh. After having his own genitals fed to the computer-vagina, Albert breaks free of Vanessa's mind-control and fights back against the computer, resulting in everyone's demise. After Albert dies, the computer gives birth to a physical Vanessa2.
