'''''Putevoy obkhodchik''''' (released as '''''Trackman''''' in the US) is a 2007 Russian [[horror film]] directed by Igor Shavlak.

==Synopsis==
Three men decide to rob a bank, having devised a plan of retreat across the abandoned tracks of a no-longer used section of the [[Moscow Metro]]. The group is led by former infantryman Grom. However, the heist spirals out of control and the raiders are forced to take hostages. They hide in the tunnels of [[Rapid transit|subway]] with the hostages. They soon come at the mercy of the [[Trackman]]. The Trackman is a [[Gigantism|giant]], who had been living in the Metro's [[catacombs]] for years. The group is methodically picked off by the Trackman, who gouges out their eyes. Grom is forced to accept that he must confront him in a "game of survival", in which there can be only one winner.
