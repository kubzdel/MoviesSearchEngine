Despite its title, the film is unrelated to the 1952 film ''[[Ghost Ship (1952 film)|Ghost Ship]]''.

==Plot==
In May 1962, aboard the [[Italy|Italian]] ocean liner ''SS Antonia Graza'', dozens of wealthy passengers dance to the song "[[Gino Paoli|Senza Fine]]" sung by Francesca, an Italian [[lounge singer]]. A young girl, Katie Harwood, sits alone until the ship's captain offers to dance with her on the exterior dance floor. Elsewhere, a hand presses a lever that unravels a thin wire cord from a spool. The spool snaps and the wire whips across the dance floor, bisecting the dancers.

Forty years later, at a bar, a boat salvage crew — Captain Sean Murphy, Maureen Epps, Greer, Dodge, Munder, and Santos — celebrate their recent success. Jack Ferriman, a Canadian weather service pilot, approaches them and says he spotted a vessel adrift in the [[Bering Sea]]. Because the ship is in international waters, it can be claimed by whomever brings it to port. The crew sets out on the ''Arctic Warrior'', an ocean [[salvage tug]]boat. The ship is the ''Antonia Graza'', which was believed to be lost at sea. As they prepare to tow it, they discover it contains a large quantity of gold. After a series of supernatural events, the group decides to abandon the salvage effort but take the gold, but an invisible force sabotages the ''Arctic Warrior''. The tugboat explodes as its engine is restarted, killing Santos.

Left with no other option, the group begins repairing the ''Antonia Graza''. Greer encounters Francesca, who seduces him into betraying the fiancée he has ashore, then leads him off a precipice to his death. Captain Murphy enters the captain's cabin and finds his ghost. The captain explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruise ship, the ''Lorelei'', along with a sole survivor. Murphy is shown a picture of the survivor, whom he recognizes. He rushes to tell the others, but begins hallucinating and sees everyone as the ghost of the burned Santos, who provokes him into a murderous rage. The others think Murphy has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank, where Epps later finds him drowned.

Epps meets Katie's ghost, who reveals what happened on the ''Graza''. The sole survivor of the ''Lorelei'' convinced the ''Graza'''s crew to murder the passengers for the gold. Once the passengers were killed, the crew turned on one another; soon, only a single officer was left, but he was later killed by Francesca. Another man, the mastermind behind the massacre, then killed Francesca by mystical means and branded her palm with a hook-shaped symbol using only his hands. The man is revealed as Jack Ferriman, who is actually a demonic spirit. Epps deduces that Ferriman lured the salvage team to the ''Graza'' to repair it, and decides to sink it to thwart his plan. While Munder is crushed under the ship's gears while scuba diving in a flooded area, Epps tells Dodge to keep Jack on the ship's bridge while she secretly sets explosives. When Ferriman realizes that Dodge is on to his secret, he walks towards Dodge while insulting him for not being man enough to act upon his feelings for Epps. Dodge threatens to shoot Ferriman, who simply smiles and says that murderers go to hell. Dodge shoots and Ferriman is seemingly killed.

Epps is below decks setting explosives when she is confronted by Dodge. He tells her he has killed Ferriman and that they can salvage the gold to start a life together, but Epps is made suspicious by this unexpected romantic proposal and Dodge's apparent knowledge of the deaths of the rest of the crew despite not being told of them. Realizing that his ruse has failed, "Dodge" morphs into Jack Ferriman, who has killed the real Dodge. Ferriman describes himself as a salvager of souls, a job he earned by a lifetime of sin. He plans to use the ''Antonia Graza'' and the gold as a trap to continue collecting souls. Only the souls of sinners can be readily controlled, through the mark he brands them with, and as long as the ''Graza'' is kept afloat the soul of everyone who has died aboard the ship will be dragged down when Ferriman has filled his quota and returns to hell, something which will please the "management". He offers to spare Epps's life in exchange for her not interfering but she detonates the explosives. Ferriman is blown to pieces in the explosion and Katie helps Epps escape the sinking ship. Katie wordlessly bids farewell to Epps before she and the other unmarked souls trapped on the ship ascend to heaven.

Drifting on the open sea, Epps is found by a cruise ship and returned to land. As she is loaded into an ambulance, she sees the battered crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by crewmen overseen by Ferriman, who glares at her and carries on; she screams as the ambulance doors close.

==Production==
''Ghost Ship'' first emerged in January 1996 as ''Chimera'', a [[spec script]] by [[Mark Hanlon]].<ref name="do">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/ghost_ship.html |title=Ghost Ship - by Mark Hanlon - First Draft |publisher=Dailyscript.com |date=January 29, 1953 |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}</ref> This script was a relatively bloodless [[psychological thriller]] rather than a vivid [[supernatural horror]] film. Most notably, much of the film's gore is absent from the screenplay. The film would have focused on four members of a salvage crew who end up stranded aboard the ghost vessel they are scuttling (the titular ''Chimera''); over the course of one night, each member — due to panic, [[cabin fever]], or supernatural forces — goes insane and plots to kill the other three.

In ''Chimera'',<ref name="do" /> Murphy is the "main killer" and the ship runs onto some rocks and begins to sink. Murphy and Epps survive until nearly the end but as the ship sinks, Murphy goes off to retrieve gold ingots. The weight of the gold and the time he loses in getting it lead to Murphy's demise. As in the film, Katie helps Epps escape. Over time, the script underwent rewrites, and the psychological aspects of the script were all jettisoned in favor of making the film a slasher. It has been suggested that "The cast signed on based on this (original) draft ... and were sadly disappointed to find the script had been radically changed by Joel Silver and associates when they arrived to begin shooting."<ref>[http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/ghost_ship_info.txt First draft screenplay of "Ghost Ship" (formerly "Chimera" ).]</ref>

The film's ship, the ''Antonia Graza'' was visually based on the [[SS Andrea Doria|''Andrea Doria'']] and is a close replica. This was mentioned in the special feature clips on the film's DVD release.

===Critical response {{anchor|Critics}}===
According to internet review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Ghost Ship'' has a 14% approval rating based on 125 reviews. The consensus states that "With a plot as creaky as the boat, ''Ghost Ship'' fails to deliver the scares".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost Ship - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ghost_ship/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=  April 18, 2018}}</ref> Similarly, [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 28/100 based on 25 reviews and rates the film as "generally unfavorable".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost Ship Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/ghost-ship|work=Metacritic.com|accessdate=September 24, 2011}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}
The film received varied critical reception in the United States: ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s Stephen Holden criticized its preoccupation with special effects, and though praised its establishment of mood, ultimately deemed it "an incoherent supernatural thriller that would like to think of itself as a Halloween-ready horror fusion of ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]].''<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=FILM IN REVIEW; 'Ghost Ship'|author=Holden, Stephen|date=October 25, 2002|accessdate=February 10, 2018|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/movies/film-in-review-ghost-ship.html}}</ref> Carla Meyer of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' praised the performance of Isaiah Washington, but deemed the film "a stupid, derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense. Granted, there are only so many ways to kill people in these pictures, but lingering on a woman on a meat hook doesn't make a movie scary. It makes it gross."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-CLIPS-Also-opening-today-2779417.php|title=FILM CLIPS / Also opening today|date=October 25, 2002|author=Meyer, Carla|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref>

[[Manohla Dargis]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' was critical of the script's lack of character development, writing: "With its minor shivers and modest Grand Guignol showmanship, ''Ghost Ship'' is the sort of flimflam that would have filled eight paneled pages in the great horror comic book ''Tales From the Crypt'' or consumed about 30 minutes on the latter-day HBO spinoff."<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Manohla Dargis|Dargis, Manohla]]|title=In 'Ghost Ship,' gore mixes with seawater|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/oct/25/entertainment/et-capsules25.3|date=October 25, 2002|accessdate=February 12, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/XibXZ|archivedate=February 15, 2018|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] said the film is "better than you expect but not as good as you hope,"<ref>{{cite news|title=Ghost Ship - by Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021025/REVIEWS/210250306/1023|accessdate=February 12, 2018 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> while Joel Siegel of ''[[Good Morning America]]'' awarded the film a B- rating, writing: "After a very brutal and bloody beginning, ''Ghost Ship'' plays like an old-fashioned ghost story, the kind that kept you awake when you were a kid."<ref>{{cite web|work=Good Morning America|publisher=ABC News|title=Joel Siegel Reviews New Movies|date=October 25, 2002|author=Siegel, Joel|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/JoelSiegel/story?id=101082&page=1|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> In a review published by [[IGN]], the reviewer awarded the film one-and-a-half out of five stars, stating: "as a horror fan, I applaud what Silver and Zemeckis are trying to do with Dark Castle, ''Ghost Ship'' just isn't a cruise worth taking."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[IGN]]|title=This Weekend at the Movies: Ghost of a Chance|date=October 25, 2002|accessdate=February 9, 2018|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/25/this-weekend-at-the-movies-ghost-of-a-chance|author=Linder, Brian}}</ref>

Upon the film's release in the United Kingdom in January 2003, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Bradshaw]] praised its set design, but added "it's the same old tired stuff we've seen a hundred times before in various permutations."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=[[Peter Bradshaw|Bradshaw, Peter]]|title=Ghost Ship|accessdate=February 14, 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/94661/ghost.ship}}</ref> Jamie Russell of the [[BBC]] awarded the film two out of five stars, but praised its opening sequence.<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|work=[[BBC]]|author=Russell, Jamie|title=Review - Ghost Ship|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/12/06/ghost_ship_2003_review.shtml|date=January 19, 2003|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}</ref>
