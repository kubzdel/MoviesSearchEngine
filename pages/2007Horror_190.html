'''''Saw IV''''' is a 2007 American-Canadian<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/845198|title=BFI Film & TV Database - Saw IV|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> [[horror film]] and the fourth installment in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'' franchise]]. It was directed by [[Darren Lynn Bousman]] and written by newcomers, [[Marcus Dunstan]], [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Thomas Fenton]]. It stars [[Tobin Bell]], [[Scott Patterson (actor)|Scott Patterson]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Betsy Russell]], and [[Lyriq Bent]].

The film continues the story of the [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw Killer]]'s obsession with teaching people the value of their lives. Despite Jigsaw's death in [[Saw III|the previous installment]], the film focuses on his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work. The story follows [[List of Saw characters#Daniel Rigg|Lieutenant Daniel Rigg]] being put through a series of tests in order to try to let go of his obsession with saving everyone, while at the same time attempting to save his partner.

The film was released in [[North America]] on October 26, 2007, to generally negative reviews from critics. Despite this, the film was a box office success, grossing $139 million worldwide.

==Plot==
A wax-coated [[microcassette]] is found in [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|John Kramer's]] stomach during his autopsy, and reveals to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] that the games will continue and he will still be tested. Elsewhere, two men - one with his eyes sewn shut, the other with his mouth sewn shut - awaken in a [[mausoleum]], chained at the neck to a winch. The blinded man panics and activates the winch before attacking the muted man, who kills him in self-defense and uses a key from his collar to free himself.

Four days after Allison Kerry's death, a [[SWAT]] team led by Hoffman and Lieutenant Daniel Rigg find her body, and Hoffman warns Rigg against breaking through an unsecured door to reach her. The scene is also investigated by Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez, Kerry's FBI contacts, who received a message and a key from her. Noting John and [[Amanda Young|Amanda Young's]] physical limitations, Strahm speculates that a third accomplice was involved and soon becomes suspicious of Rigg, who has developed an obsession with saving people in the six months since the disappearance of detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]]. That night, Rigg is attacked in his home; he awakens and watches a video from Jigsaw, which is where he learns that Eric is still alive and he has ninety minutes to save him, with Hoffman's life at risk as well. Meanwhile, he must play his own game in order to face and overcome his obsession. 

Rigg finds a prostitute, named Brenda, bound to a chair in his living room, and accidentally activates the trap, which slowly tears her scalp off. He manages to free her, but kills her in self-defense when she attacks him with a knife in order to evade arrest. Rigg is then led to a motel and instructed to abduct the owner, Ivan Landsness, who Rigg later finds out is a serial rapist. He forces Ivan onto a bed, which requires Ivan to blind both of his eyes in order to escape. However, Ivan only blinds one of his eyes, and the trap dismembers him. Next, Rigg is led to a school, where he finds a married couple impaled by metal spikes: Rex, who has already died from blood loss; and his abused wife Morgan, who has remained alive at his expense by pulling the spikes from both of their bodies. Rigg pulls out the last spike and gives her a key to free herself. He then turns on a fire alarm and goes to the location of his final test.

The agents alternate between investigating the scenes and questioning Jill Tuck, John's ex-wife. Jill reveals John worked in civil engineering and property development, and that she miscarried her son Gideon after seven months when Cecil Adams, a drug addict, slammed a door into her stomach while robbing her health clinic. At the motel, the agents learn that the room was rented out to a lawyer named Art Blank, the survivor of the mausoleum trap, who vanished two weeks prior. Art is revealed to be the man overseeing the current game when he hands Eric a gun. At the school, the agents learn that all three victims, and Jill were Art's clients. Strahm and Perez find a puppet and a tape recorder in another room, which plays a cryptic message for Perez before its face explodes, sending shrapnel into her face. After Perez is hospitalized, Strahm furiously questions Jill. He learns how Kramer ended his work with Art after falling into his depression, and that Cecil became the first victim of John's "games". Strahm connects his story and a prior clue to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, the location of Rigg's final test.

Strahm arrives after Rigg, but ends up following Jeff Denlon, the protagonist in [[Saw III]]. After finding Jeff in the sickroom, Strahm shoots him in self-defense when Jeff demands his daughter back. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a device which will free them when the timer expires; if used before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Rigg finds them and is shot by Eric as he breaks into the room with one second to spare, releasing two overhead ice blocks that swing down and crush Eric's head, killing him. Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, only to learn from Art's tape recorder that his interference and continued obsession caused Eric's death. Hoffman, the actual accomplice, releases himself from the chair, but leaves Rigg to die. He then seals Strahm in the sickroom and leaves the plant. The scene then cuts to Hoffman at the morgue, revealing that John's autopsy took place after the events of the film.

Scott Schueller from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it “a film as edgy as a rubber knife” and said that “if the terrible craft of Bousman's film doesn’t turn your stomach, the borderline pornographic violence will.
