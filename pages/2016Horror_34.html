==Production==
The film is based on the 2006 [[Cell (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]]. [[Dimension Films]] announced that in March 2006 that [[Eli Roth]] would direct the project after finishing ''[[Hostel 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2006/film/markets-festivals/dimension-hits-speed-dial-1117939407/|title=Dimension hits speed dial|last=Fleming |first=Michael|date=March 7, 2006|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=May 7, 2016}}</ref> Roth exited the project in 2009, saying:
{{quote|text=There was just sort of a difference in opinion on how to make the film and what the story should be, and there's a different direction the studio wants to go with it. It was very friendly because it's the Weinsteins, they made ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' and we're all friends. I said, 'I'm not really interested in doing the film this way. You guys go ahead and I'm going to make my own films.' I've also learned that I really am only interested in directing original stories that I write, that's another thing I learned through that whole process.<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=Eli Roth Not Involved with Hostel III|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/horror/news/714071-eli-roth-not-involved-with-hostel-iii|work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=[[CraveOnline Media]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> }}
