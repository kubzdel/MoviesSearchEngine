==Reception==
Matt Molgaard of ''Horror Freak News'' wrote that the film "isn’t smooth, and it isn’t steady. It’s more like a wheelin’ session with your best buddy in his brand new, lifted truck. It’s everywhere. It’s dirty. And you never know when it may just roll right over, or get stuck in knee-high muck."<ref>{{cite web|last=Molgaard|first=Matt|title=The Appearing (2014) Review|date=18 May 2016|publisher=''Horror Freak News''|url=http://horrorfreaknews.com/appearing-2014-review|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>

Lizzie Duncan of HorrorNews.net wrote that the film "is a fairly average film with no big scares in it and only a moderate twist at the end. It’s not terrible, but not too great either. Nothing was overtly ‘wrong’ with the film, but it could have been explored in a more coherent, gripping manner."<ref>{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Lizzie|title=Film Review: The Appearing (2013)|date=31 March 2014|publisher=HorrorNews.net|url=http://horrornews.net/66468/the-appearing-2013/|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref>
