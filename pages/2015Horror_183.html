== Critical reception ==
[[The Hindu]] wrote, "The problem is that the nobility of Vijay's motive isn't really backed by any serious exploration of the business of education. The story may have perhaps germinated from this idea, but the film takes such a long time to get to this point that ‘lessons’ at the end seem like an afterthought — and a manipulative afterthought at that".<ref>http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/strawberry-good-intentions-alone-dont-make-a-good-film/article7645933.ece</ref> [[The Times of India]] gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, "''Strawberry'' could have been mildly engaging if only it had released some five years ago. Given the amount of horror films that Tamil movie audiences have been exposed to during this period, the film feels utterly redundant. The filmmaking, too, isn't interesting, and depends on done-to-death cliches — moody skies, pouring rain, tacky visual effects and high-pitched music, supported by bland performances".<ref>http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie-reviews/Strawberry/movie-review/48932417.cms</ref> [[Sify]] wrote, "to be frank, the one-liner of Strawberry is definitely interesting but for an engaging watch, a film needs something called water-tight writing and strong characterizations which the director has sadly missed out! The film is highly amateurish and is unbearable as the director tries to make it a social tear jerker".<ref>http://www.sify.com/movies/strawberry-review--pjmoJiejaadei.html</ref>

[[Rediff]] gave 3 out of 5 as well and wrote, "Despite the lack of scary moments, the uninspiring computer graphics and cliché-ridden climax, a decent storyline and some good performances make lyricist Pa Vijay's ''Strawberry'' worth a watch".<ref>http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-strawberry-is-a-decent-directorial-debut-south/20150914.htm</ref> [[The New Indian Express]] wrote, "''Strawberry'' can be considered as a debutant maker's promising work".<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/Yatchan-Review-Supernatural-Thriller-with-a-Strong-Social-Message/2015/09/14/article3025048.ece</ref> Indiaglitz gave 2.5 out of 5 for the film, praising the acting of Yuvina Parthavi while criticising the score, special effects and dialogue of the climax.<ref name="Indiaglitz">{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/strawberry-tamil-movie-review-19858.html|title=Strawberry review.
