'''''The Green Inferno''''' is a 2013 American [[Cannibal film|cannibal]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Eli Roth]]. The film was inspired by and is a homage to [[Italian cinema|Italian]] [[cannibal film]]s of the late 1970s and early '80s "[[cannibal boom]]", including ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980), which features a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film-within-a-film]] titled ''The Green Inferno''. The film follows a group of activists who are forced to fight for survival when they are captured by a cannibalistic tribe.

The film was released on September 25, 2015, by [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse Tilt]] and [[FilmDistrict|High Top Releasing]].

==Plot==
Justine, a college freshman, becomes interested in a [[social activism]] group led by Alejandro and his girlfriend Kara. The group plans a trip to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to stop a company from logging and obliterating ancient native tribes there; the goal is to film the logging crews with cell phones and stream footage to raise awareness. Justine suggests she could bring attention to the issue through her father, an attorney for the [[United Nations]].

The operation is funded by a drug dealer named Carlos, who takes the group of students to [[Peru]] via plane. They arrive in the Amazon and head to a logging site where they begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the loggers cutting down trees. A [[Private military company|private militia]] arrives, and the protest receives viral attention on the internet when Justine is nearly killed by one of the militia officers. The group is arrested, but Carlos pays the police to let them go. As the plane leaves, it crashes into the forest, killing Carlos.

Justine, Alejandro, Kara, and protest members Jonah, Lars, Amy, Samantha, and Daniel survive and search for a GPS phone to call for help. Suddenly, numerous young men painted in red come out of the bushes and kill Kara. The rest of the group are tranquilized and taken to a small village where they are imprisoned in a bamboo cage. The female elder of the cannibal tribe ritualistically dismembers, beheads, and eats Jonah. Samantha attempts to escape, but she is tranquilized and the group finds out that they are being watched. Alejandro reveals – to everyone else's dismay – that he had cynically staged the protest to benefit a rival company, and the eventual deforestation of the area is inevitable.

The next morning, the tribe's male leader in black and yellow paint orders Justine, Samantha, and Amy out of the cage. The girls are tested with a sharpened instrument, and Justine is revealed to be a virgin. She is taken away, and prepared for a [[genital mutilation]] ceremony. When Samantha and Amy are brought back to the cage, they distract the watchman with a ringing cell phone and Samantha escapes. The next day, Justine is returned with paint marks on her, and the tribe brings the prisoners meat. After finishing her meal, Amy realizes the meat came from Samantha, who was recaptured and dismembered. She smashes her bowl and uses a shard to cut her own throat. Lars stuffs [[marijuana]] down Amy's throat, hoping to get the tribe high when they cook her. His plan works, and Justine and Daniel escape, but Alejandro tranquilizes Lars and both are left behind. Lars is eaten alive by the tribe.

Justine and Daniel return to the site of the plane crash and find a phone in Kara's pocket, but are recaptured by the tribe shortly after. Justine is prepared for her ceremony where she is put in tribal attire and painted white with red across her eyes. Daniel is tied to a pole, his limbs broken, and fed to ants. Logging machinery attracts the cannibals to the jungle. The distraction allows Justine to escape with the help of a child sympathizer. Daniel begs for Justine to kill him and the child sympathizer blows a white powder into Daniel's face, knocking him out before slitting his throat. Alejandro is abandoned by Justine in the cage.

Two tribe members chase her down, but lose her when she crosses a river with a [[Black panther|black jaguar]] on the other side of it. However, the big cat doesn't harm her and she runs into the jungle. Justine encounters the same private militia that had captured her earlier as they slaughter the native warriors and the male tribal leader is killed. Justine uses Kara's phone to pretend to film the fight, stopping the militia from firing on the remaining native warriors. Justine is taken home to safety.

In New York, Justine lies to her father, telling him that she was the only survivor of the crash and that the tribe was friendly to her.

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Alejandro's sister Lucia tells Justine during a phone call that she has found him on a satellite GPS image, showing a surviving Alejandro painted black like the Natives.

===Critical reception===
''The Green Inferno'' received generally negative reviews from critics; however, some praised the film's throwback vibe to earlier Italian cannibal horror films of the 1970s and its social commentary. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 33%, based on 85 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Green Inferno'' may not win writer-director Eli Roth many new converts, but fans of his flair for gory spectacle should find it a suitably gruesome diversion."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_green_inferno/ |title=The Green Inferno |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 38 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-green-inferno |title=The Green Inferno reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] audiences gave the film an average grade of "C-" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/09/the-intern-hotel-transylvania-2-the-green-inferno-weekend-box-office-1201550112/|title=‘Hotel Transylvania 2’ Set To Deliver New September Opening Record & Adam Sandler's Second Best Debut|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>

The film received a glowing response from horror novelist [[Stephen King]], who [[Twitter|tweeted]] that the film is "like a glorious throwback to the drive-in movies of my youth: bloody, gripping, hard to watch, but you can't look away."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/644696951963951104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw | title=Stephen King on Twitter: "THE GREEN INFERNO is like a glorious throwback to the drive-in movies of my youth: bloody, gripping, hard to watch, but you can't look away." | work=[[Stephen King]] | publisher=[[Twitter]] | date=September 17, 2015 | accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/09/18/eli-roth-freaks-out-at-stephen-king-s-tweet-mentioning-the-green-inferno-3550219?lt_source=external,manual | title=Stephen King Tweets About the Green Inferno Film, Causing Eli Roth to Flip Out! | work=Michelle Smith | publisher=[[Moviepilot]] | date=September 18, 2015 | accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref> Todd Gilchrist of ''[[TheWrap|The Wrap]]'' gave the film a negative review, stating "Unfortunately, Roth’s abundant gore fails to either offend or exhilarate."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/the-green-inferno-review/ | title='The Green Inferno' Review: Eli Roth Upends the Cannibal Film | work=Todd Gilchrist | publisher=[[TheWrap|The Wrap]] | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=September 19, 2015}}</ref> ''Birth. Movies. Death.''{{'}}s Meredith Borders, reporting from [[Fantasia International Film Festival|Fantasia Fest]], gave the film a more positive notice: "''The Green Inferno'' never lets up: it barrels ahead, exuberant and relentless in its brutality, never giving the audience a second to unclench. It's a feast for gorehounds, one with an unsubtle message about the way that uninformed activism harms more than it helps. And it's a total blast."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2014/08/03/fantasia-fest-review-the-green-inferno-will-eat-your-face-clean-off | title=Fantasia Fest Review: THE GREEN INFERNO Will Eat Your Face Clean Off | work=Meredith Borders | publisher=Birth.

===Controversy===
The film was criticized by [[Survival International]], which campaigns for [[indigenous peoples]] and [[Uncontacted peoples|indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation]], as reinforcing  [[Colonialism#Impact of colonialism and colonization|colonialism]] and respectively [[Neocolonialism#Multinational corporations|neocolonialism]], as well as [[Cannibalism#As used to demonize colonized or other groups|their stigmas]] against indigenous peoples, portraying them as [[The white man's burden|savage]].<ref name="BI">{{cite web | title=Eli Roth cannibal rainforest controversy | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/eli-roth-cannibal-rainforest-controversy-2014-8 | publisher=Business Insider | accessdate=March 30, 2015}}</ref> Roth dismissed this argument as unimportant for stopping exploitation: "The idea that a fictional movie about a fictional tribe could somehow hurt indigenous people when gas companies are tearing these villages apart on a daily basis is simply absurd. These companies don't need an excuse—they have one—the natural resources in the ground.  They can window dress things however they like, but nobody will destroy a village because they didn't like a character in a movie, they'll do it because they want to get rich by draining what's under the village. The fear that somehow a movie would give them ammunition to destroy a tribe all sounds like misdirected anger and frustration that the corporations are the ones controlling the fates of these uncontacted tribes."<ref name="BI"/>
