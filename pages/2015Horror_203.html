'''''The Witch: A New-England Folktale''''' (stylized '''''The VVitch''''') is a 2015 [[Historical period drama|period]] [[supernatural horror film]] written and directed by [[Robert Eggers]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]]. The film stars [[Anya Taylor-Joy]], [[Ralph Ineson]], [[Kate Dickie]], Harvey Scrimshaw, Ellie Grainger and Lucas Dawson. ''The Witch'' follows a [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|Puritan]] family encountering forces of evil in the woods beyond their [[New England]] farm.

An [[international co-production]] of the United States and Canada, the film premiered at the [[2015 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 27, 2015 and was [[wide release|widely released]] by [[A24 (company)|A24]] on February 19, 2016. The film received positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $40 million against a budget of $4 million.<ref name=BOM/>

==Plot==
In 1630s [[New England]], a man named William is banished from a [[Puritans|Puritan]] plantation alongside his wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, due to a difference in interpretation of the [[New Testament]]. The family leaves the plantation and builds a farm by the edge of a large, secluded forest far from the Puritan settlement. Katherine soon gives birth to her fifth child, Samuel. Thomasin is playing [[peekaboo]] with Samuel when he abruptly disappears. Samuel is then [[Irony#Dramatic irony|revealed to the viewer but not to his family]] to have been kidnapped by a [[witch]], who crushes his body to pulp and rubs herself in the remains.

Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying. William takes Caleb hunting in the forest and confides to his son that he traded Katherine's silver cup for hunting supplies. On the farm, the twins play with the family's [[goat]], Black Phillip, claiming that he [[Talking animal|speaks to them]]. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her silver cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for the disappearance of Samuel. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.

Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to hunt in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their father. Their dog gives chase to a hare and Caleb follows on foot as the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and eventually stumbles upon the disemboweled corpse of his dog. He later discovers a moss-covered hovel. A seductive young woman appears at the door and lures Caleb towards her. Meanwhile, Thomasin awakens and reunites with her father, who is searching for her and Caleb. Katherine confronts Thomasin about taking Caleb into the woods and William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherine's silver cup.

That night, Caleb is found outdoors in the rain, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. Katherine suggests that her son's mysterious ailment is due to [[witchcraft]] and prays over him. The next day, Caleb suffers a violent seizure and expels a small apple from his mouth before dying. As Caleb nears death, his parents and Thomasin kneel reciting the Lord's Prayer which causes great distress to the twins who insist they cannot remember the words and implore the others to stop. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, she reveals their conversations with Black Phillip. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house. After dark, the twins and Thomasin awaken to find a hideous naked old woman drinking a white goat's blood. Meanwhile, Katherine is overjoyed by a vision of Caleb and Samuel's return. She begins breastfeeding the infant which is revealed to be a black [[raven]] pecking at her bare and bloody breast.

The next day William finds the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. William, dying, picks up an axe and contemplates killing the goat, but resigns himself to death and quotes from the [[Book of Job]] before being knocked into a woodpile. The commotion awakens the unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her. Thomasin grabs a nearby [[billhook]] and kills her in self-defense.

That night, Thomasin, in desperation, urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds in human tongue and suddenly transforms into a man. He convinces her to [[Deal with the Devil|sign her name]] in his book, guiding her hand as she does so and offering her the sights of the world and the luxurious life she wants to live. Thomasin wanders naked into the forest with Black Phillip, again incarnated as a goat, where she discovers a [[coven]] of witches [[Witches' Sabbath|dancing around a bonfire]]. The witches begin to levitate and a laughing Thomasin joins them above the trees.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was partially based on Eggers's childhood fascination with [[witchcraft|witches]]. After unsuccessfully pitching films that were "too weird, too obscure", Eggers realized that he would have to make a more conventional film.<ref name="Indiewire">{{cite web|last1=Anielski|first1=Ryan|title=How Robert Eggers Combined History and Childhood Horrors in 'The Witch'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/how-robert-eggers-combined-history-and-childhood-horrors-in-the-witch-20151021|website=Indiewire|accessdate=February 9, 2016}}</ref> He said at a Q&A, "If I'm going to make a genre film, it has to be personal and it has to be good."<ref name="Indiewire"/> The production team worked extensively with British and American museums, as well as consulting experts on seventeenth-century British agriculture.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bitel|first=Anton|title=''Voices of the undead: Robert Eggers on The Witch''|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/interviews/robert-eggers-witch|date=March 11, 2016|publisher=British Film Institute|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}</ref>

Eggers wanted to film the picture on location in New England but the lack of [[tax incentives]] meant he had to settle for Canada.<ref name="Indiewire"/> This proved to be somewhat of a problem for Eggers, because he could not find the forest environment he was looking for in the country.<ref name="Indiewire"/> They had to go "off the map", eventually finding a location ([[Kiosk, Ontario]]) that was "extremely remote"; Eggers said that the nearest town "made New Hampshire look like a metropolis".<ref name="Indiewire"/>

===Filming===
In order to give the film an authentic look, Eggers shot only "with natural light and indoors, the only lighting was candles". Eggers also chose to stylize the film's title as "The VVitch" in its title sequence and on posters, stating that he found this spelling in a [[Jacobean era]] pamphlet on witchcraft, along with other period texts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Jessica|title=Designer-Turned-Director Robert Eggers Discusses His Horror Film ‘The Witch’|url=https://www.format.com/magazine/features/design/the-witch-robert-eggers-movie-interview|website=Format Magazine|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>

In December 2013, costume designer [[Linda Muir]] joined the crew, and consulted 35 books in the ''Clothes of the Common People in Elizabethan and Early Stuart England'' series to plan the costumes. The costumes were made with wool, linen, or hemp. Muir also lobbied for a larger costume budget.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/dressing-witch-interview-costume-designer-linda-muir/# |title=Dressing The Witch: An Interview with Costume Designer Linda Muir |last=Ankenbauer |first=Sam |date=27 May 2016 |accessdate=24 March 2017 |work=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]}}</ref>

===Music===
[[Mark Korven]] wrote the film's score, which aimed to be "tense and dissonant", while focusing on minimalism. Eggers vetoed the use of any electronic instruments and "didn’t want any traditional harmony or melody in the score", and so Korven chose to create music with atypical instruments, including the [[nyckelharpa]] and the [[waterphone]]. He knew that the director liked to retain a degree of creative control, so he relied on loose play centered on improvisation "so that [Eggers] could move notes around whenever he wanted".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3381360/we-interviewed-composer-mark-korven-about-his-terrifying-score-for-the-witch/|work=Bloody Disgusting|title=We Interviewed Composer Mark Korven About His Terrifying Score for ‘The Witch’|date=26 February 2016 |author=Barkan, Jonathan|accessdate=24 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nofilmschool.com/2016/09/mark-korven-composer-the-witch|date=16 September 2016|title=How Mark Korven Avoided the Temptations of Temp Music to Score 'The Witch'|author=Fusco, Jon|accessdate=5 August 2017}}</ref>

=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 292 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "As thought-provoking as it is visually compelling, ''The Witch'' delivers a deeply unsettling exercise in slow-building horror that suggests great things for debuting writer-director Robert Eggers."<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|the_witch_2016}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] reports a weighted average score of 83 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".<ref name="Meta">{{metacritic film|the-witch}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C–" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it a 55% overall positive score and a 41% "definite recommend".<ref name=opening/>

Writing in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Justin Chang commented that "A fiercely committed ensemble and an exquisite sense of historical detail conspire to cast a highly atmospheric spell in ''The Witch'', a strikingly achieved tale of a mid-17th-century New England family’s steady descent into religious hysteria and madness."<ref>{{cite web| last= Chang| first= Justin|date=January 23, 2015 |title=Sundance Film Review:  'The Witch'| url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/sundance-film-review-the-witch-1201411310/| work=Variety|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Yohana Desta of ''[[Mashable]]'' stated that ''The Witch'' is a "stunningly crafted experience that'll have you seeking out a church as soon as you leave the theater".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/02/16/the-witch-review/#aYJHIG06qiqu |title='The Witch' is a film so f*cked up, Satan would see it twice|last=Desta|first=Yohana|date=February 18, 2016| website=[[Mashable]].com|language=English|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]], in his ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review, gave the film 3 1/2 stars, and wrote of ''The Witch'': "Building his film on the diabolical aftershocks of Puritan repression, Eggers raises ''The Witch'' far above the horror herd.

However, some critics as well as audiences were less pleased with the film; Ethan Sacks, of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', wrote that while the film does not suffer from the cinematography, acting, or setting, early on it "seems that ''The Witch'' is tapping a higher metaphor for coming of age...or religious intolerance...or man's uneasy balance with nature...or something.

''[[HitFix]]'' writer Chris Eggertson was critical of mainstream Hollywood; he said that ''The Witch'' "got under [his] skin profoundly", though he argued that it "did not have the moment-to-moment, audience-pleasing shocks that moviegoers have become accustomed to thanks to movies like ''[[Sinister (film)|Sinister]]'' and ''[[The Purge (film)|The Purge]]'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity (film)|Paranormal Activity]]'' and every other [[Blumhouse]] and [[Platinum Dunes]] title in the canon."<ref>{{cite web|last=Eggertsen |first=Chris |url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/why-do-so-many-horror-fans-hate-the-witch |title=Why do so many horror fans hate The Witch? |publisher=Hitfix.com |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2016}}</ref>

But the festival’s lineup revealed a resurgence of interest in the religious: In ''[[Don Verdean]]'', an affectionately satirical comedy, [[Sam Rockwell]] stars as a “Biblical archaeologist” who becomes a pawn in a war between two rival local ministers. ''The Witch'', a pristine horror debut from writer/director Robert Eggers, is a chilling circa-1600 story of the devil taking over a devout, Scripture-quoting family. ''[[I Am Michael]]'', executive produced by [[Gus Van Sant]], tells the true story of Michael Glatze (played by James Franco), a former gay activist who denounced homosexuality and became a Christian pastor. Other films like ''[[Z for Zachariah (film)|Z for Zachariah]]'' and ''[[Me and Earl and the Dying Girl|Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl]]'' subtly draw on questions and motifs that animate Biblical narratives and questions.}}</ref> [[Eve Tushnet]] commented in an article in ''[[The American Conservative|TAC]]'', which was also published in ''[[First Things]]'', that ''The Witch''{{'}}s view of witchcraft is "not revisionist" and further states that the film is "pervaded by the [[fear of God]]. There are occasional references to His [[mercy]] but only as something to beg for, not something to trust in".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/out-in-the-fields-with-God/|title=Out in the Fields with God|last=Tushnet|first=Eve|date=February 26, 2016|publisher=[[The American Conservative]]| accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2016/03/first-links-3416|title=First Links — 3.4.16|last=Tushnet|first=Eve|date=March 4, 2016|website=[[First Things]].com |accessdate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>

A review by Adam R. Holz on ''Plugged In'', a publication of the [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christian]] organisation [[Focus on the Family]], heavily criticised the film, stating that

{{blockquote|William is absolutely devoted to leading his family in holiness and the ways of the Lord, which should be a good thing. But the fruit of William's rigorous focus on dogmatic piety isn't a lifting of burdens, which we're told should happen in {{Bibleverse|Matthew|11:30|KJV}}, or a joyful celebration of living life to the fullest, as is referenced in {{Bibleverse|John|10:10|KJV}}; rather it is deep fear and morbid meditations on hell, damnation and the forces of spiritual darkness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/movie-reviews/the-witch-2016/|title=The WitchMovie Review (2016)|year=2015|publisher=[[Plugged In]]|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>}}

Josh Larsen of ''Think Christian'', however, offered a Christian explanation of the conclusion of the film, stating that in "encountering evil, the family in the film veers wildly back and forth between 'triumphalism' and 'defeatism,' two theological extremes" and "in refusing to allow for [[Grace in Christianity|grace]], they become easy pickings for the witch".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkchristian.reframemedia.com/should-christians-be-afraid-of-the-witch|title=Should Christians be afraid of The Witch? |last= Larsen| first= Josh| date= February 24, 2016|publisher=Think Christian|accessdate=February 28, 2016}}</ref>

A spokesperson for the [[nontheist]] [[Satanic Temple]], Jex Blackmore, claimed that A24 "approached the temple to say it believed the film would be of interest to members, though it didn't specifically ask for an endorsement".<ref name=VanDerWerff/> However, the Satanic Temple endorsed the film, even going as far as starting a tour for the film, which began on February 10, 2016.<ref name=VanDerWerff>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11049790/the-witch-satan-satanism|title=Why satanists have given new horror movie The Witch their endorsement - Vox|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|date=February 18, 2016|publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|language=English|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> The group believes "[the film] will signal the call-to-arms for a Satanic uprising against the tyrannical vestiges of bigoted superstitions, and will harken a new era of liberation and unfettered inquiry", and started a website where people can "officially register themselves into 'The Book of Satan'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/beware-horror-fans-the-witch-has-just-been-named-an-official-satanic-experience-20160203|title=Beware, Horror Fans: 'The Witch' Has Just Been Named an O|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=February 3, 2016|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|language=English|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> Nevertheless, Todd VanDerWerff of [[Vox (website)|Vox]] stated that

{{blockquote|A24 could have just as easily courted the approval of, say, [[Christian theology|theologians]] who have a fondness for [[Calvinism]]. ''The Witch'' takes place in Colonial America, and it unfolds from the perspective of period Christians who genuinely believe the woods around their tiny farm contain some sort of evil, supernatural being—and are ultimately proved correct.<ref name=VanDerWerff/>}}
