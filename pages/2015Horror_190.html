== Plot ==
Many years ago, a group of construction workers were building a theater when the ceiling collapsed; many survived, but more than a hundred men died when the ceiling fell upon them. They were buried beneath the theater.

Annie ([[Andi Eigenmann]]), an engineer, wants to consult a group of exorcists and spirit mediums led by a priest ([[John Estrada]]) to help her gather information about an old theater with a dark past before she starts her project there.

But things got worse when she left the circle and is now being possessed by a demon.
