== Synopsis ==
The film opens with a young woman, Amber, fleeing from Henry, a serial killer. She is almost caught and murdered, but is saved by the appearance of Matt, a detective that shoots and kills Henry before he can accomplish this. Matt and his partner Darcy find a box containing four cursed [[worry doll]]s, which belonged to Henry. They're approached by Della, an old woman that raised Henry after his father died, who unsuccessfully tries to claim the dolls, which are confiscated as evidence. After leaving the crime scene Matt visits his ex-wife Amy, but unbeknownst to him their young daughter Chloe finds the worry dolls and takes them for herself. Unaware of their origin, Chloe turns the dolls into necklaces and sells them at her mother's store. Every person that purchases the necklaces will become possessed and becomes violent, committing bloody murder. This also includes Chloe herself, as her mother bought one of the dolls for her daughter - eventually resulting in Chloe's hospitalization after killing a dog.

Meanwhile Matt and his partner have been following along with the two worry doll related crimes so far, discovering how they tie together after finding evidence linking them to Henry. They realize that all of the perpetrators had purchased worry dolls from Chloe and that she had taken them from Matt. They meet up with Della, who tells them that the dolls were once capable of strong healing magic, but became cursed after she gave them to a young Henry, as his sorrow and darkness from his father's death corrupted them. Della cautions them that they must bring Chloe and the dolls to her in order to remove the curse from the child and the dolls. Now aware that they must collect all the dolls, Darcy and Matt begin looking for the final two dolls, as they had previously collected the dolls from the prior two murders. They're successful in collecting the third doll and halting a murder, but Darcy dies while retrieving the fourth doll from Ethan, Amy's boyfriend.

After collecting all four worry dolls Matt brings them and Chloe to Della, only to discover that the old woman has no intention of saving his daughter. She explains that she wants to cleanse the dolls so they can become forces of good once more, but that doing so would require Chloe's death, due to the presence of Henry's darkness inside her. Unwilling to let this happen, Matt struggles with Della and manages to throw the worry dolls into the fireplace. Della tries to retrieve the dolls, but sets herself on fire in the process and runs into a nearby lake to put herself out. Matt is happy to discover that his daughter has survived and is apparently no longer possessed. Before the film ends, the viewers are shown that Della has also survived.

The acting and special effects are terrible, but unfortunately not terrible enough to be a true camp classic.
