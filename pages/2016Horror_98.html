The film had its world premiere at the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] on June 8, 2016, and was released in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2016, by [[Warner Bros.]] The film received positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $148 million against a budget of $4.9 million.

== Plot ==
In a textile factory, an employee named Esther encounters a silhouette of a woman when the lights are off, but cannot see it when the lights are on. She warns her boss Paul. He also encounters the woman and notes that she will not come into the light. He is killed by the woman after she chases him through the factory.

A short time later, a young woman named Rebecca is called into the school nurse’s office of her brother, Martin. Rebecca and Martin are half-siblings, sharing the same mom: Sophie. The nurse was unable to get in touch with Sophie to inform her that Martin has been falling asleep in class lately. An official from Child Protective Services questions Rebecca about Martin’s living conditions. Rebecca tells the official Sophie has depression, and is taking antidepressants. Rebecca also tells the official Paul was her stepfather, and that her real father ran away when she was a child.

Rebecca and her boyfriend, Bret, take Martin to Sophie’s house. Martin tells Rebecca that Sophie has been talking to a woman named “Diana”. Rebecca assures Martin that Diana isn’t a real person, and that she had also heard Sophie talk to the imaginary Diana when she was a child. Rebecca gets in an argument with Sophie when she realizes her mom is not taking her medication, so she takes Martin to her apartment so he can rest. 

That night, Rebecca is woken by the same woman that killed Paul after she notices her scratching at the floor. Rebecca narrowly escapes an attack from the woman when she turns the lights on and the woman disappears. The next morning, Rebecca notices the word “Diana” has been scratched into her floor, along with a stick figure drawing of a woman. Rebecca has a flashback to when she found the same name and drawing as a child, and realizes Diana is real. 

While her mom is running errands, Rebecca sneaks into Sophie's house and finds a box of medical records and other research in Paul’s office. Paul's findings reveal that Sophie was admitted to a mental hospital as a child. While there, she befriended a young patient named Diana. Diana suffered from a severe skin condition, and was accidentally killed by the hospital staff when they performed surgery on her under intense light. Rebecca also learns that Diana was admitted to the mental hospital after her dad committed suicide, and that it was believed that Diana was able to "get into people's heads".

Rebecca, Bret, and Martin stage an intervention at Sophie’s house about how Diana’s spirit is haunting them all. Sophie becomes irate, says she won’t abandon her friend, then locks herself in her bedroom. The team decides to stay the night at Sophie’s, intending to get her help in the morning. To avoid an attack from Diana during the night, they rig the house to be as brightly lit as possible. This proves to be useless when Diana cuts the power to the neighborhood. Diana traps Rebecca and Martin in the basement, and attempts to kill Bret. Bret escapes Diana, and drives to get help from the police. In the basement, Rebecca finds a black light while searching for light sources to brighten the basement. When Rebecca clearly sees Diana with the black light, she realizes it’s not powerful enough to harm her. 

Bret returns with two police officers. The officers free Martin and Rebecca from the basement, only to be murdered by Diana. As they’re fleeing the house, Rebecca remembers Sophie is still in her bedroom. As she climbs the stairs to retrieve her mom, Diana tells Rebecca that she killed Rebecca’s father years ago. Diana throws Rebecca off the second floor landing. As Diana prepares to kill Rebecca, Sophie appears, with a gun from one of the dead officers. Sophie realizes she is the tether for Diana to exist in the real world, and commits suicide. As Sophie falls to the floor, Diana vanishes. 

Later, Bret comforts Martin and Rebecca in an ambulance outside of Sophie’s house. The three of them appear to be slightly spooked when the ambulance lights flicker.

== Production ==
Sandberg, along with his wife  Lotta Losten, created the initial short film for a film competition. Although the film did not win the competition, the short soon went viral, leading to Sandberg to be contacted by several agents, to the point where he had to develop a [[spreadsheet]] to keep track of them all.<ref name="Airbnbdaily">{{cite web|last1=Wixson|first1=Heather|title=LIGHTS OUT Interview: Director David F.

Although Wan enjoyed the short, he was hesitant that it could be turned into a feature until Sandberg produced a treatment for the feature-length version.<ref name="Airbnbdaily"/>

The move to [[Hollywood]] was somewhat hectic for the couple, requiring that Losten quit her day job in order to do so. Once in Hollywood the two were unable to get an apartment due to a lack of credit, forcing them to rent [[Airbnb]] on a monthly basis.<ref name="Airbnbdaily"/>

The casting of Gabriel Bateman and Teresa Palmer was announced in June 2015; which was the same month that principal photography had begun.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Gabriel Bateman to Star in James Wan’s ‘Lights Out’|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/gabriel-bateman-james-wan-lights-out-1201521298/|accessdate=July 2, 2015|work=variety.com|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|title=Teresa Palmer To Star In James Wan’s ‘Lights Out’ For Atomic Monster, New Line|url=http://deadline.com/2015/06/teresa-palmer-lights-out-james-wan-atomic-monster-1201459410/|accessdate=July 2, 2015|work=deadline.com|date=June 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=On the Set for 6/29/15: Justin Lin Rolls Cameras on ‘Star Trek Beyond’, Emilia Clarke Wraps ‘Me Before You’|url=http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-62915-justin-lin-rolls-cameras-on-star-trek-beyond-emilia-clarke-wraps-me-before-you/|accessdate=July 2, 2015|work=ssninsider.com|date=June 29, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630233856/http://www.ssninsider.com/on-the-set-for-62915-justin-lin-rolls-cameras-on-star-trek-beyond-emilia-clarke-wraps-me-before-you/|archivedate=June 30, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=June2015HellHorror>{{cite news|title=Teresa Palmer Joins LIGHTS OUT with James Wan|url=https://hellhorror.com/article/8928/Teresa-Palmer-Joins-LIGHTS-OUT-with-James-Wan.html|accessdate=July 2, 2015|work=hellhorror.com|date= June 29, 2015}}</ref> Sandberg had not worked with a [[film crew]] or visited a [[film set]] before directing ''Lights Out''; he had to ask the [[first assistant director]], "So when do I say action?"<ref name="sandberg20160809">{{cite web | url=https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/4wl6ac/what_makes_a_movie_scary_now_you_see_it/d6aeeth?context=3 | title=dauid comments on What Makes a Movie Scary?- Now You See It | publisher=Reddit | date=August 9, 2016 | accessdate=August 20, 2016 | author=Sandberg, David F.}}</ref> Filming wrapped on August 5, 2015.<ref name="James Wan on Instagram">{{cite web|title=James Wan on Instagram|url=https://instagram.com/p/6Bs4PtBVHG/|website=[[Instagram]]|accessdate=August 5, 2015|date=August 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="James Wan on Instagram"/>

Special effects of having the ghost appear and disappear were mostly done by using a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] technique as also used in the short. Sandberg said "Whenever she’s in frame with another character, it’s basically just a split screen. So you shoot it with her and without her. You turn the camera on with her, you turn it off and she walks off, and then you turn it on again. It’s super simple, actually."  Sandberg also made a list of what he called the "light gags", or different ways to create light sources from flashlights to cell phones and gunfire. In the scene when Diana appears in Rebecca's room, James Wan suggested replacing passing car headlights in an early treatment with the flashing neon sign that appears in the final film. <ref name="av club"/>

Sandberg originally based the character of Rebecca a real girl that he knew who was going through depression and being a [[Self-harm|cutter]] which is why Rebecca has scars on her arms, but the development of the film made it less of her depression, and more of a ghost story in which Diana would have been the real person who died and became a ghost. Wan came up with the idea of making Diana the ghost. Rebecca's boyfriend was also given a twist of being a rocker, but is actually committed and responsible, even driving a safe car like a Volvo. Another twist Sandberg liked was making the imaginary friend for the mother rather than the trope of having the friend be for the child.<ref name="av club"/> 

===Suicide concerns and ending===
After hearing concerns from critics that the ending of the film was [[pro-suicide|promoting suicide]], Sandberg interviewed with [[AV Club]] where he said he was distressed about that idea, and wanted to explain his position. He said that he originally wanted to make a film about depression, as he has also suffered from it, and that one of his friends had committed suicide. Diana was not a ghost back then, but during the development of the film, it became more of a horror film. It still retained some themes about depression and mental illness. He had originally shot a second ending to the film in which Martin becomes depressed and Diana comes back one more time before she is killed. However, test audiences hated that ending, saying that Sophie's sacrifice would have been in vain.<ref name="av club">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/lights-out-director-david-sandberg-defends-ending--240341|title=Lights Out director David Sandberg defends the ending of his horror hit|author=|date=July 30, 2016|website=avclub.com|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>

===Critical response===
On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 76% based on 152 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 6.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Lights Out'' makes skillful use of sturdy genre tropes—and some terrific performances—for an unsettling, fright-filled experience that delivers superior chills without skimping on story."<ref name="RT">{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lights_out_2016 |title=''Lights Out'' (2016)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref name="Meta">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lights-out |title=''Lights Out'' Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore|work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

Lucy O'Brien of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the film 7/10, saying: "[w]ith an unnerving monster at its core, great cast and relentless final sequence, ''Light’s {{sic}} Out'' is a debut director Sandberg should be proud of. A clunky script occasionally loosens its grip on the nerves, but chances are Diana will still have you sleeping with the lights on for a good while after leaving the theatre."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/01/lights-out-review |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |title=Fear the dark. |work=[[IGN]] |date=July 1, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref> [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, stating: "[e]ven the most cynical, jaded, seen-it-all-before critic cannot deny certain visceral reactions to a film.

A few critics were less taken with the film. [[James Berardinelli]] of ''Reelviews'' gave 2 stars out of 4, saying: "[u]nfortunately, the film stumbles, offering too few legitimate scares and displaying an overreliance on traditional horror movie clichés." Berardinelli detested the film's camerawork, characters as being "thinly drawn", and the screenplay "spending inordinate amount of time providing a backstory..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/lights-out |last=Berardinelli |first=James|title=Lights Out (United States, 2016) |work=[[Reelviews]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> [[Rex Reed]] of ''[[The Observer]]''  gave 1 star out of 4, saying: "the film's screenplay focuses almost entirely on the number of resourceful and ingenious ways the characters dream up to keep the lights on, stave off the next attack and stay alive—lights from candles, flashlights, cellphones, the car in the driveway—before the batteries die; The fun wears out fast and so does the “gotcha” factor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/07/lights-out-is-a-sad-excuse-for-a-horror-flick |last=Reed |first=Rex |title=‘Lights Out’ Is a Sad Excuse for a Horror Flick |work=[[The Observer]] |date=July 20, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>
