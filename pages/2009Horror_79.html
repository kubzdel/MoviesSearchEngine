A helpless Taxi driver, a mysterious delivery boy, a 30 years abandoned motel, a touching past, all stitches up to form a strange tale.

One day, a strange passenger "Pony" ([[Julian Cheung]]) hires a taxi driver "Map King" ([[Gordon Lam]]), paying him a huge sum of money to take him to an abandoned old motel, "Chun Lei Motel". This motel was mysteriously burnt 30 years ago, and has been abandoned ever since. No one knows of its existence, nor does anybody talks about it. To Pony’s surprise, the taxi driver Map King actually knows how to get to the motel.

Fong ([[Michelle Ye]]), the only female character in this story, is the owner of the Chun Lei Motel. She started off her peaceful life with her only son until the day where "The 4 Thieves" visits her motel, on the seventh day after her husband’s death. Mysteriously, the motel was on fire right after the meeting and everyone had gone missing after the fire incident, and the motel was abandoned for 30 years. What actually happened to the motel? What’s the reason behind the fire?
