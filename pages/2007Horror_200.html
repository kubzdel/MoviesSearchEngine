'''''Skinwalkers''''' is a 2007 [[horror film|horror]]-[[action film]]. It was released in the United States by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] and [[After Dark Films]], and focuses on [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. Directed by [[James Isaac]], it stars [[Jason Behr]], [[Elias Koteas]], [[Rhona Mitra]], and [[Tom Jackson (actor)|Tom Jackson]]. The film was originally announced for theatrical release on December 1, 2006, but was delayed until August 10, 2007. 

''Skinwalkers'' marks [[Lions Gate Entertainment]]'s first collaboration with [[Constantin Film]], which produced such other [[science fiction film|science fiction]]/horror films as ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Wrong Turn]]''. The visual effects are by effects house Mr. X, and the creature effects by [[Stan Winston|Stan Winston Studio]]. 

The film was shot at Century Manor in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. To achieve [[MPAA rating|PG-13]] rating, the production cuts several scenes containing graphic violence like ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]''—the home media release is the uncut version of the title.

==Plot==
Two packs of werewolves, divided by principles, are signaled by the moon of the coming of an ancient prophecy. A young boy named Timothy ([[Matthew Knight]]) approaches his 13th birthday, unaware this marks the time of his transformation. Timothy has been raised by his grandmother Nana (Barbara Gordon), his mother Rachel ([[Rhona Mitra]]), his uncle Jonas ([[Elias Koteas]]), his cousin Katherine ([[Sarah Carter]]) and Katherine's boyfriend, Adam ([[Shawn Roberts]]). His father is said to be dead.

Rachel and Timothy have been unaware that the rest of the family are "good" werewolves who have guarded Timothy and his secret since birth. They know that Timothy is a "half-blood" who is prophesied to end the curse. But they also know that Timothy's power will put him in danger, for there are other werewolves that revel and embrace their blood-lust and are bent on finding and killing the boy. Four of these werewolves are a [[motorcycle]] pack—leader Varek ([[Jason Behr]]), and cohorts Zo ([[Kim Coates]]), Sonya ([[Natassia Malthe]]), and Grenier ([[Rogue Johnston]]), who use a hawk as an  airborne spy—who track down Timothy in the small town of Huguenot, precipitating the movie's extended chase.

Varek discovers the location of Timothy via a video tape which is shown to various "good" werewolves that he is alive and well. Reaching Huguenot, Varek saw Nana and Timothy and proceeds with a gunfight between his pack against the "good" werewolves and various townspeople. Adam's father is killed in the gunfight and Nana sacrifices herself to let Timothy and the others escape. Jonas explain the whole situation to both Rachel and Timothy and they are convinced after Jonas and others turn into werewolves at night.

The next day, Timothy faints and is sent to a nearby hospital. Varek's gang infiltrate the hospital and attack Timothy. Grenier is killed by Adam while Katherine is being held hostage by Varek. It is subsequently revealed that Varek was Caleb, Rachel's husband and Timothy's father, and his transformation was due to him feeding on humans.

After escaping to a safe place, Adam goes off on his own and finds Katherine and brings her back. At sundown, Katherine was discovered to have been forced to feed on humans and kills Adam with his own gun. Just as Katherine is about to attack Timothy, Jonas manages to kill her with a gunshot in the back.

They manage to find their next safe place, with Rachel and Timothy hiding in a steel cage while Jonas sets out to ambush Varek, Zo & Sonya. Zo is killed after being trapped and being dropped down from a height. Sonya tries to attack Rachel and Timothy but is shot by Timothy. Rachel then proceeds to finish Sonya off. Varek then tries to kill Timothy but is stopped by Jonas. They get into a struggle and in a bid to win, Jonas feeds on Varek's arm and knocks Varek unconscious. Taken over by the blood frenzy, Jonas attempts to attack Timothy, but is shot to death by Rachel. Varek wakes up and bites Timothy but the clock chimes midnight. He is then struck by Rachel and knocked to the ground. He then transforms back into a human and to his former self, Caleb.

It is later revealed that Timothy is the cure via his blood and that they travel around, giving the cure to those who want it. They also fill bullets with Timothy's blood. The film leaves off with Timothy saying "For some I am salvation, for the others their destruction".

==Reception==
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 13% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 3.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Skinwalkers'' is an atrociously-acted project whose unoriginal and ineptly-staged action sequences remind viewers of far better werewolf and action movies."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/skinwalkers/|title=''Skinwalkers'' (2007)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref> 

''Skinwalkers'' had no advance screenings for critics, though Lionsgate did provide DVD screeners to those who asked. [[Maitland McDonagh]] of [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] noted that "the emphasis is more on conventional action than on man-to-wolf metamorphosis effects and the subsequent beastly mayhem," and said the movie was "briskly paced and features a couple of clever twists on genre conventions before getting bogged down".<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/skinwalkers/review/286675 TVGuide.com] (August 10, 2007): ''Skinwalkers'', by Maitland McDonagh (review)</ref> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' said that, "Before flagging toward the end to become a second-rate ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|Terminator 2]]'', this Canadian-made action drama sparks an old-fashioned [[B-movie]] charge—it's welcome-to-the-grindhouse all over again with such delicious conceits as a town of werewolf-citizens and a pistol-packing grandma going it gangsta-style".<ref>[http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003623915 ''Film Journal International''] (August 10, 2007): ''Skinwalkers'', by Frank Lovece (review)</ref> Despite the praise given to the creature effects by Stan Winston, the film received mostly negative reviews.
