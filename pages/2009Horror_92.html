'''''Halloween II''''' is a 2009 American [[slasher film]] written, directed, and produced by [[Rob Zombie]]. The film is a sequel to Zombie's [[Halloween (2007 film)|2007 remake]] of [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978's ''Halloween'']], and the tenth installment of the  [[Halloween (franchise)|franchise]]. Picking up where the 2007 film ended and then jumping ahead one year,<!--The theatrical release is 1 year. The Director's Cut is 2 years. Please do not change!--> ''Halloween II'' follows [[Laurie Strode]] as she deals with the aftermath of the previous film's events, [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] who is trying to capitalize on those events by publishing a new book that chronicles everything that happened, and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] as he continues his search for Laurie so that he can reunite with his sister. The film sees the return of lead cast members from the 2007 film [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Scout Taylor-Compton]], and [[Tyler Mane]], who portray Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and Michael Myers, respectively.

For ''Halloween II'', Zombie decided to focus more on the connection between Laurie and Michael, and the idea that they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of ''Halloween II'', it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include [[John Carpenter]]'s original ''Halloween'' theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.

''Halloween II'' was officially released on August 28, 2009 in [[North America]], and was met with a negative reception from critics. On October 30, 2009 it was re-released in North America to coincide with the [[Halloween]] holiday weekend. The original opening of the film grossed less than the 2007 remake, with approximately $7 million. The film would go on to earn $33.4 million in North America, and $5.9 million in foreign countries giving the film a worldwide total of $39.3 million.<ref name="overall"/>

==Plot==

In a flashback, [[List of Halloween characters#Deborah Myers|Deborah Myers]] ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]) visits her son, a young [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] ([[Chase Wright Vanek]]), at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. She gives him a white horse statuette as a gift. Michael says that the horse reminds him of a dream he had of Deborah's ghost, all dressed in white and telling him she was going to bring him home.

Moving ahead fifteen years, [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]) is wandering around in shock after having shot an adult Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]). [[List of Halloween characters#Sheriff Leigh Brackett|Sheriff Leigh Brackett]] ([[Brad Dourif]]) finds Laurie and takes her to the emergency room. Meanwhile, the paramedics pick up [[List of Halloween characters#Annie Brackett|Annie Brackett]] ([[Danielle Harris]]) and Michael's psychiatrist [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), who are still alive after being attacked by Michael, and take them to the hospital. 

One year after the events of [[Halloween (2007 film)|the first film]], Laurie is now living with the Bracketts. Michael has been missing since last Halloween and is presumed dead, while Laurie has been having recurring nightmares about the event. While Laurie deals with her trauma through therapy, Dr. Loomis has chosen to turn the event into an opportunity to write another book. Elsewhere, Michael, who is still alive, has been having visions of his mother's ghost and a younger version of himself, who instructs him that it is time to bring Laurie home, so he sets off for Haddonfield.

As Michael travels to Haddonfield, Laurie begins having hallucinations that mirror Michael's, which involves Deborah's ghost and a young Michael in a clown costume. Her hallucinations also begin to include her acting out Michael's murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour to promote his new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. 

When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a Halloween party with Mya ([[Brea Grant]]) and Harley ([[Angela Trimbur]]) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears at the party and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie. When Laurie and Mya return to the house, they find Annie, who dies in Laurie's arms. Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Sheriff Brackett arrives home and finds his daughter dead. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.

The police discover Michael's location and surround the shed. Loomis arrives and goes inside to try to reason with Michael. Inside, he finds Laurie, who is hallucinating a younger Michael holding her down, and tries telling her that no one is restraining her. Just then, Deborah instructs the older Michael that it is time to go home; Michael attacks Loomis and kills him. Stepping in front of a window while holding Loomis' body, Michael is shot twice by Sheriff Brackett, and falls into the spikes of some farming equipment. Apparently released from her visions, Laurie walks over and tells Michael she loves him, then stabs him repeatedly. The shed door opens and Laurie walks out, wearing Michael's mask. Later, Laurie sits in isolation in a psychiatric ward, grinning at a vision of Deborah.

In 2008, at the 30 Years of Terror Convention, ''Halloween'' producer Malek Akkad confirmed that a sequel to Rob Zombie's 2007 film was in the works. French filmmakers [[Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo]] were in negotiations to direct the sequel in November 2008,<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Powers|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/11/03/more-details-on-the-sequel-to-rob-zombies-halloween/|title=More Details on the Sequel to Rob Zombie's Halloween|publisher=First Showing|work=Dead Central|date=November 3, 2008|accessdate=November 4, 2008}}</ref> but on December 15, 2008 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Rob Zombie had officially signed on to write and direct the ''Halloween'' sequel.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997402.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Zombie making 'Halloween' sequel|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=December 16, 2008}}</ref> In an interview, Zombie expressed how the exhaustion of creating the first ''Halloween'' made him not want to come back for a sequel, but after a year of cooling down he was more open to the idea.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997402.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=Zombie making 'Halloween' sequel|publisher=Reed Business Information|work=Variety|date=December 15, 2008|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> The writer/director explained that with the sequel he was no longer bound by a sense of needing to retain any "John Carpenter-ness", as he "felt free to do whatever".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7235:interview-rob-zombie-on-halloween-2&catid=44:interviews&Itemid=172|title=Interview: Rob Zombie on Halloween 2|publisher=IESB|author=Christina Radish|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2010}}</ref> Producer Malek Akkad said the original intention, when they believed Zombie was not returning, was to create a "normal sequel".<ref name="Akkad">{{cite web|author=Ryan Rotten|title=Set Interview: Halloween 2's Malek Akkad|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=10392|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> Akkad and his Trancus producing company hired various writers to come up with drafts for a new film, but none worked. Akkad and the Weinstein brothers then turned to Bustillo and Muary, whose film ''[[Inside (2007 film)|Inside]]'' had recently been bought for distribution by the Weinstein Company. According to Akkad, the producers really wanted Zombie to return, as Akkad felt that there was something "lost in the translation" when the French filmmakers took over the project.<ref name="Akkad"/> After his work on the 2007 remake, Zombie had earned the trust of Akkad, who told him to ignore any rules they had set for him on the previous film. Akkad said that he wanted Zombie to move the franchise away from some of its established rules.<ref name="Akkad"/>

===Characters===
For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif returned to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. [[Daeg Faerch]], who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for ''Halloween II''. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown too big for the part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for ''Halloween II'' contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.<ref name="Zombieint"/>

Laurie; Loomis; they're having all kinds of problems in their life, but Michael just moves along.

===Music===
For the sequel, Zombie only used Carpenter's original theme music in the final scene of the film, though the director admits that he and music composer [[Tyler Bates]] tried to find other places to include it. According to Zombie, Carpenter's music did not fit with what was happening in the film; whenever he or Bates would insert it into a scene it "just wouldn't feel right" to the director.<ref name="Zombievid"/> Zombie also used popular culture songs throughout the film, with "[[Nights in White Satin]]" appearing the most prominently.

===Critical reception===
Based on 73 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Halloween II'' has an overall 19% approval rating from critics, with an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 3.7 out of 10, with the general consensus reading "Zombie shows flashes of vision in the follow-up to his ''Halloween'' reboot, but they're smothered by mountains of gore and hackneyed, brutal violence."<ref name="rt">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/h2_halloween_2/|title=''Halloween II'' Movie Reviews|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Rob Nelson, of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', felt the use of Deborah and the white horse was nothing more than "silly", and he disagreed with Zombie's choice to film ''Halloween II'' in 16mm film, as opposed to wider format of 35mm that he used on his 2007 remake. Nelson also stated that the hospital scene was nothing more than a "butcher"-version of Carpenter's 1981 sequel, with the rest of the film feeling like it was rushed and "slapped together" at the last minute.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940908.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|author=Rob Nelson|publisher=Reed Business Information|work=Variety|title=''Halloween II'' review|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' believed the hospital scene at the start of the film "[bested the 1981 sequel] in just about every respect". ''Time Out'' stated that Compton's portrayal of Laurie Strode showed an "intense, nontrivializing dedication to the role" that kept interest, while the storyline of Dr. Loomis's egocentricity hinders the overall storyline. ''Time Out'' also said that Zombie hurt the film by trying to show how "violence lingers with, and perverts, all who are touched by it", but then undercutting himself with "carnivalesque" violence.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/77981/halloween-ii-film-review |journal=[[Time Out (company)|''Time Out'']] |title=''Halloween II'' review |issue=727 |date=September 3–9, 2009 |accessdate=April 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911132906/http://newyork.timeout.com/articles/film/77981/halloween-ii-film-review |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> Although the ''[[New York Post]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Kyle Smith did not believe the character of Laurie Strode was a balance for Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis, he agreed the ghostly images of Deborah Myers were a "relief from the blood-streaked brutality" of Michael's murders.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/horror_show_shtick_or_treat_7abHvNpV5DcQoYdfJZickK|title=Horror-Show Shtick or Treat|author=Kyle Smith|publisher=News Corporation|work=[[New York Post]]|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'s'' Tom Russo had varied reactions to the film. Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with ''Halloween II'', but only achieved mixed results for his efforts. Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as "pretentiously silly", but agreed that the scenes did help to break up the standard genre violence and even went so far as to compare the sensation created by those scenes to "[[Tim Burton]] doing straight horror". In the end, Russo claimed that "only the most hardcore fans" would want the film series to continue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2009/08/29/halloween_sequel_has_few_treats/|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|publisher=The New York Times Company|title=‘Halloween’ sequel has few treats|author=Tom Russo|date=August 29, 2009|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}</ref> Joe Neumaier, of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', stated that Zombie has found himself with ''Halloween II''. Neumaier describes the film as a successful "'character-based' monster-flick". Zombie's use of music from the 1970s, like [[The Moody Blues]]' "[[Nights in White Satin]]" and [[10cc]]'s "[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]", is "terrifically odd" throughout the film. Neumaier also said that the imagery of Deborah Myers and the "ethereal white horse" were a "nice visual relief" from Michael's violent attacks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2009/08/28/2009-08-28_halloween_ii_.html|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title='Halloween II' scares up surprisingly good stab at redefining slasher genre by director Rob Zombie|date=August 28, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2010 | first=Joe | last=Neumaier}}</ref>
