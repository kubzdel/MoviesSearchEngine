'''''The Human Race''''' is an American [[horror film]] directed and written by [[Paul Hough]].<ref name=SBM>{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=Scott Bain|title=Interview: Paul Hough : THE HUMAN RACE|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/7528-interview-paul-hough-the-human-race|publisher=Starburst|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> A work-in-progress copy was screened at the 2012 [[Fantasia Film Festival]] and the finished copy had its world premiere on April 11, 2013 at the [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]]. It stars [[Paul McCarthy-Boyington]], [[Eddie McGee]] and [[Trista Robinson]] as a group of people who find themselves forced to race or die.

== Synopsis ==
About eighty people are horrified to wake in a strange institutional setting, with the only common factor between them the knowledge that prior to their abductions they witnessed a sudden flash of white light. A voice in their heads demands that they all participate in a gruesome race to the finish. The rules are that they must all participate and that if they stray from the marked paths in any way or if they are lapped twice, they will die. Only one person will survive. Many die instantly, but others are forced to their deaths by other racers. As the numbers thin, the survivors become more and more desperate to stay alive.
