'''''The Omen''''' (also known as '''''The Omen: 666''''') is a 2006 American [[supernatural horror]] film directed by [[John Moore (director)|John Moore]] and written by [[David Seltzer]]. A remake of the [[The Omen|1976 film of the same name]], the film stars [[Liev Schreiber]], [[Julia Stiles]] and [[Mia Farrow]]. It was released worldwide on June 6, 2006 — the date intentionally reflecting the purported [[Number of the Beast]], 666.

==Plot==
Robert Thorn ([[Liev Schreiber]]), an American diplomat stationed in [[Italy]], is told that his son was stillborn. Unknown to his unconscious wife, Katherine ([[Julia Stiles]]), Robert adopts an orphaned newborn at the suggestion of the hospital's chaplain [[Catholic priest]], Father Spiletto ([[Giovanni Lombardo Radice]]). Naming him [[Damien Thorn|Damien]] ([[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]]), Robert and Katherine raise the boy. Robert's career ascends over the course of the next five years. He is named Deputy Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Following the death of the previous ambassador, Robert assumes his position and settles in a large estate just outside [[London]]. However, disturbing events begin to occur, including the suicide of Damien's nanny at his birthday party.

Robert is approached by Father Brennan ([[Pete Postlethwaite]]), who claims to have been involved with events surrounding Damien's birth. Meanwhile, photographer Keith Jennings ([[David Thewlis]]) finds that several of his photographs contain mysterious [[omen]]s, including premonitions of people's deaths. A new nanny, Mrs. Baylock ([[Mia Farrow]]), is hired. Tension rises when Mrs. Baylock starts to make decisions without the consent of the Thorns, including adopting a [[Rottweiler]] for Damien's protection.

Following an incident near a chapel in which Damien attacks Katherine, she begins experiencing vivid dreams about her son, one of these involving a red-hooded [[jackal]] skeleton. When the Thorns visit a zoo, the animals react violently at the sight of Damien. Katherine begins to wonder if there is something wrong with Damien. Father Brennan confronts Robert, telling him that Damien's mother was a jackal, and that the boy is the [[Antichrist]]. He explains that Damien must die and a man called Bugenhagen ([[Michael Gambon]]), located in [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], can assist. After being rebuked, Father Brennan is killed during a lightning storm.

Katherine discovers she is pregnant and is determined to get an abortion, in fear of having a child similar to Damien. Soon afterward, Damien causes an accident in which Katherine is severely injured, resulting in her [[miscarriage]]. While recovering in the hospital, Katherine confides in Robert her suspicions that Damien is evil. Robert decides to rendezvous with Jennings and search for Damien's biological mother. The pair discovers the hospital where Damien was delivered has since been demolished after a fire. They travel to Subiaco and meet Father Spiletto, who directs them to a graveyard. There they find the grave of Damien's mother, who is revealed to indeed have been a jackal. In the neighboring tomb, Robert discovers the corpse of his murdered biological son. He and Jennings are attacked by a pack of dogs and barely escape.

Mrs. Baylock visits Katherine in the hospital and causes her to have an [[air embolism]], killing her. Learning of Katherine's death, Robert goes to Megiddo, meets Bugenhagen, and receives instructions on how to kill Damien on consecrated ground with seven sacrificial daggers. Bugenhagen tells Robert to examine Damien for a birthmark in the shape of [[Number of the Beast|three sixes ("666")]]. However, Robert refuses to kill his son, and throws the daggers on the ground. While reaching down to pick up the daggers, Jennings is suddenly decapitated by a falling sign.

Robert arrives home and is attacked by Mrs. Baylock's Rottweiler, which he subdues. In Damien's room, he finds the 666 birthmark. Mrs. Baylock attacks Robert, but he fends her off; after running her over with his car, he escapes with a silver [[Lexus GS]]. Pursued by the police, Robert flees to a church to kill Damien, but is killed before he can by a [[Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection|Diplomatic Protection]] officer.

As the [[Pope]] simultaneously dies, Robert's funeral is attended by the [[President of the United States]], who holds Damien's hand. Damien then looks at the audience and smiles as the credits roll.

===Box office===
The film recorded the highest opening Tuesday box office gross in domestic box office history in the United States, by earning more than US$12&nbsp;million. Fox initially stated that the film earned US$12,633,666 on its first day, but later Bruce Snyder, Fox's president of distribution, admitted that they were "having a little fun" by manipulating the figure to contain the number of the beast in the last three digits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2086&p=.htm |title='&#39;Omen'&#39; Opens to Tuesday Record |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>

The film ended grossing US$119,498,909 worldwide, making it a modest success on a budget of US$25&nbsp;million. It finished as the 59th highest-grossing film of 2006, the 12th highest-grossing R-rated movie of 2006 and the 2nd highest domestic gross of ''The Omen'' series when adjusted for inflation.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received an [[approval rating]] of 27% based on 165 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 4.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Even with the force of a "classic" behind it, remake fever can't hold up the hollowness of this style-drenched ''Omen''."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/omen/ |title=The Omen (2006) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 11, 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-omen |title=The Omen (2006) Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=May 11, 2018}}</ref>

[[James Berardinelli]] commented: "On every level, ''The Omen'' isn't just bad filmmaking, it's bad storytelling". He especially criticised the film's similarity to the original film, which he also greatly disliked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/o/omen.html |title=Reelviews Movie Reviews |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also made the latter point: "Not since [[Gus Van Sant]] inexplicably directed a [[Psycho (1998 film)|shot-by-shot remake]] of [[Psycho (1960 film)|Hitchcock's ''Psycho'']] has a thriller been copied with so little point or impact".<ref>{{cite web|author=(Posted: June 8, 2006) |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7401721/review/10512120/the_omen_2006 |title=Omen : Review |work=Rolling Stone |date=June 8, 2006 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film "thumbs up" and three stars out of four, in contrast to his negative review of the original, praising John Moore for letting the strong story unfold itself rather than foregrounding visual effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060605/REVIEWS/60524002 |title=The Omen :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=June 6, 2006 |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s Stephen Hunter praised the film: "It's handsome in the way it's fast-moving: sleek, well-engineered, full of gooses and honks. Some of the casting seems a little off. Still, it works."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/the-omen,1113085/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 |title=Critic Review for The Omen on |work=The Washington Post  |date= |accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref>

Other assessments from critics include:
* "John Moore's remake – while arguably better than its source – can't help but feel a bit stale." – [[BBC]] film review<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2006/06/05/the_omen_2006_review.shtml|title=BBC|last=Arendt|first=Paul|date=|website=BBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>

* "Director John Moore has added some creepy visuals and assembled an unusually strong cast for a horror flick." – ''[[New York Post]]''{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* "Competently made, and enjoyably played. But you do really end up wondering what the point was. Cinematic déjà vu is the most likely response." – ''[[Empire Magazine]]''<ref>http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=11300</ref>

While [[Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick]]'s performance did win him a Chainsaw award from [[Fangoria]] magazine for "Creepiest Kid", [[David Thewlis]] was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor|Worst Supporting Actor]] in 2007, but lost to [[M. Night Shyamalan]] for ''[[Lady in the Water]]''.<ref name="Raspberry">{{cite web | title=The Razzie Awards | work=Found: 27th Annual Razzie Award Nominees for Worst Supporting Actor | url=http://www.razzies.com/history/06NomsActo.asp | accessdate=2007-02-11}}</ref>
