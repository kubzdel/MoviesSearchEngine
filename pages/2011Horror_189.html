'''''Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings''''' is a 2011 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Declan O'Brien]] and starring Jenny Pudavick, Tenika Davis, Kaitlyn Wong, and [[Terra Vnesa]]. It is the fourth installment of the [[Wrong Turn (film series)|''Wrong Turn'' film series]].

== Plot ==
In 1974, at the Glenville Sanatorium in West Virginia, three deformed patients known as the Hillicker Brothers escape from their cells and release the other patients; together, they very brutally massacre the orderlies and doctors.

Twenty-nine years later, in 2003, nine Weston University students – Kenia (Jenny Pudavick), Jenna ([[Terra Vnesa]]), Vincent (Sean Skene), Sara (Tenika Davis), Bridget (Kaitlyn Wong), Kyle (Victor Zinck Jr.), Claire (Samantha Kendrick), Daniel ([[Dean Armstrong]]) and Lauren (Ali Tataryn) – are snowmobiling on their way to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. However, they get lost in a snowstorm and are forced to take shelter in the Glensville Sanatorium for the night, where the Hillickers are living. Lauren remembers her brother's stories about the sanatorium and the cannibalistic Hillickers, but her friends don't believe her. As the group goes to bed, Vincent continues to explore the asylum, where he finds Porter's corpse before being killed by Saw Tooth by an iron rod through the nose.

The next day, with the storm still in full effect, the teens remain trapped and go in search of Vincent. Jenna comes across the Hillickers butchering Porter's body in the kitchen and runs back to warn the others. After Porter's severed head is thrown at the group, Claire is hung from a balcony with barbed wire by the trio and decapitated. The group attempts to flee the building but find their snowmobiles have been sabotaged. Lauren skis down the mountain to seek help while the others barricade themselves in a doctor's office.

Kyle, Daniel, and Sara go into the basement to get weapons, but Daniel gets abducted, tied to a table in the kitchen, and slowly butchered and eaten alive. The rest of the group chases the cannibals and locks them in a cell; Kyle stays behind to watch them while the others search for spark-plugs for the snowmobiles. When Kyle falls asleep, the brothers escape their cell, and the girls accidentally stab Kyle to death after he has his tongue cut out and is dressed up like one of the Hillickers. The cannibals appear and chase the girls through the building, forcing them to climb out of a window; Jenna gets stuck and is impaled with a ground driller by Saw Tooth. The Hillickers chase the girls on the snowmobiles, where Kenia gets injured and Bridget gets crushed under one of the snowmobiles by One Eye.

As the day dawns, Lauren has frozen to death in the storm a mere few yards away from a highway. Kenia is still being chased by One Eye when Sara reappears and knocks him off the snowmobile, allowing the pair to steal it. As they gleefully drive away, they are simultaneously decapitated by a simple barbed wire fence. Three Finger picks up their heads and puts them in the yellow tow truck from the first film, before moving away from the sanatorium with his brothers.
