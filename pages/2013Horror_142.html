== Plot ==
Emma (Emma Gruttadauria) is a financially strapped B&B owner on a small island off of Cape Cod. She is a romance writer whose books are not selling because they are not erotic enough. Besides the threat of losing the B&B to foreclosure, there is more aggravation in her life when she hires a handyman, David (Josh Koopman) to fix her plumbing and he breaks two things for everything he fixes. David is a traumatized vet living out of his derelict van. Despite his inept plumbing skills and her sharp tongue about his faults, David stirs Emma’s desires and she begins to fantasize about him, putting her sexual fantasies into the story she’s writing. The two become trapped in the B&B when a strange storm suddenly hits. The storm from Hell stirs awake the dead who rise naked in salt marshes by the house. While the dead are awakening, Jack (Carl Back), a crooked real estate developer, arrives at the B&B to foreclose. Among the newly awakened deceased is Veronica (Alexandra Creteau), a young runaway with dreams of being a Hollywood star. Veronica arrives nude at the B&B. On her heels also awakened in the marshes comes Coby (Nick Apostolides) a twisted killer. Coby arrives in a police uniform with blood on him and in pursuit of Veronica. They both appear to be normal human beings but Emma soon begins to realize that the strangers have come with secrets. The realization that there is something a bit strange about her guests turns to a sense of horror as she realizes that they are the living dead . . . and that sometimes the dead have unfinished business.

Over 95 percent of the film was shot was shot in and around the Cape Cod 1772 historical house owned by the director, his wife, and Carol McCleary. Generally speaking no one in the cast or crew had prior experience making a movie. The director, Hilde Podrug, and Carol McCleary performed some crew tasks under assumed names and the name of characters from their books to create the appearance of a bigger production. John M.

== Reception ==
The film received mixed reviews. There has been criticism for the fact that while there are “living dead” in the film, they are not traditional zombies. Reviewer Mike Habefelner stated “it's actually a pretty weird and inventive supernatural mystery, on a narrative level at least, and it features a bunch of pretty good performances. The movie just lets itself down a bit on the directorial level, it just seems too ... conventional.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/movies/nightofthenakeddead(2012).shtml|title=(re)Search my Trash|website=www.searchmytrash.com|access-date=2016-07-14}}</ref>  A Horror Society review by Blacktooth stated “The acting in this one is surprisingly well done.  The entire cast does a great job and that brings their characters to life . . .  The story actually had potential to be one spooky and atmospheric ghost story but fell short when it tried to be a moody drama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.horrorsociety.com/2013/12/01/night-of-the-naked-dead-review/|title=Night of the Naked Dead (Review)|date=2013-12-02|website=Horror Society|access-date=2016-07-14}}</ref> Tom Gleba of ''NerdRemix.com'' called it a “very cool, very atmospheric movie with good performances.” He gave it a “firm 7 out of  10.”<ref>{{Citation|last=Tom Gleba|title="Night of the Naked Dead"(2014) Review|date=2014-04-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j60NWpsfA8U|accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref> Michael Allen in a ''28 Days Later Analysis'' said the film “is influenced by the phenom director Alfred Hitchcock and the supernatural sci-fi television series ‘X-Files.’”<ref>{{Citation|last=Podrug|first=Junius|title=Night of the Naked Dead|date=2012-11-01|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2236642/news#ni56080639|accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref>  It had a slightly over a 70% ratio of viewer “Likes” to “Dislikes” in regard to the Kings of Horror YouTube presentation January–July 2016.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kings of Horror|title=Night of the Naked Dead {{!}} Full Horror Movie|date=2016-01-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDoDk1Pbh5A|accessdate=2016-07-14}}</ref>
