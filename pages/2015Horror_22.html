'''''Aztec Revenge''''' (also known as '''''Mil Mascaras: Aztec Revenge''''') is a 2015 American [[lucha libre]] film starring the legendary Mexican wrestler and film star [[Mil Máscaras]]. It continues a storyline from the popular 2008 film, [[Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy]], and is the third of a trilogy of films that also includes [[Academy of Doom]].

==Plot==
The Professor discovers that thieves have absconded with priceless Aztec artifacts that were shipped to Columbia State University for study after the defeat of a resurrected Aztec mummy several years earlier by Mil Mascaras. The Professor reports the theft to Mil, who immediately flies to campus. After Mil Mascaras is attacked by teams ninjas and sorority sisters he concludes that one of the artifacts, the Jewel of Tonauac, is being used by someone - or some ''thing'' - for mind control. Mil and the Professor visit a fraternity that they suspect may be involved and discover that the head of an Aztec chief has been resurrected and has plans for world domination. Mil is captured and restrained so that his (Mil's) head can be removed and replaced with that of the Aztec chief. With help from the Professor, Mil escapes and destroys the head.
