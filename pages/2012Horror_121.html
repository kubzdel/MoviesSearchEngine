==Synopsis==
All Steve ([[Kristopher Turner]]) wants is to make his incredibly controlling fiancee Tina ([[Crystal Lowe]]) happy, even if it's at his own personal expense. His best friend Craig ([[Shawn Roberts]]) and sister Sarah ([[Kristen Hager]]) accompany Steve to their family's cabin in the hopes of convincing him that she's not right for him, but with no success. When Steve is infected with a strange virus via a mosquito bite, he begins to turn into a zombie and hunger for brains. Despite this new turn of events, all Tina cares about is getting married and doesn't care that Steve is starting to miss various body parts. Now Steve must try to control his new urges while also trying to avoid a zombie hunter ([[Stephen McHattie]]) out to end his existence.
