They found a house, which it's the owner is the Ap ghost. They asked permission to stayed for their field trip. And she said yes.

==Critical reception==
The Khmer film industry is small and new Khmer films often meet a muted response in the mainstream media. One website which did review the film, ''The Fright'', described the film in their article
''Leaks, Penanggalans and ''Ap''s, Oh My!'' positively, stating that it is very much in the throat-ripping tradition of [[Mystics in Bali]] and [[Demonic Beauty]], and the film is all the better for it. The review strongly praised the camera work and lighting. They criticized the low quality of special effects, however, as not able to match expectations when it comes to special effects in modern film production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fright.com/edge/leaks___.htm|title=Leaks, Penanggalans and Krasues, Oh My!: |accessdate=2008-11-22|publisher=Fright}}</ref>

==Box office==
This film is considered to be the first successful Khmer horror films in recent years, having grossed over $100,000 solely from the six movie theatres in [[Phnom Penh]].

It set a local box office record by running for almost three months.

==Special effects==
Special effects are primarily not computer generated. In one scene, a doll's head filled with pig intestines was used to make the ''Ap'''s head. Whilst not realistic, the film's sound effects resulted in many viewers screaming nonetheless.

==Origins==
In the Khmer ghost legends ''Ap'' was a complete person who was able to remove its head at night to fly across the rice fields in search of sustenance, usually blood. Stomach, heart and intestines trail from her neck.<ref name="Arb-vampire"/>

This [[nocturnal]] female ghost with a floating head is part of popular [[Southeast Asia]]n [[mythology]], namely the folklore of [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Thai folklore|Thailand]]. In [[Laos]] this ghost is called ''Pi-Kasu'' while in [[Thailand]] it is known as ''Krasue'' and in [[Malaysia]] ''[[Penanggalan]]''.
