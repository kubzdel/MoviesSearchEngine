==Description==
''The Love Witch'' uses the figure of the [[Witchcraft|witch]] as a metaphor for women in general, as both an embodiment of men's fears of women, and of women's own innate powers of [[intuition]] and as mothers and sorceresses.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.rue-morgue.com/single-post/2016/04/04/Sinister-Seven-ANNA-BILLER-casts-a-spell-on-men-in-THE-LOVE-WITCH |title=Sinister Seven: Anna Biller casts a spell on men in 'The Love Witch' |first=Scott |last=Feinblatt |journal=[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]] |issn=1481-1103}}</ref> The lead character of the film is a young woman who uses magic to make men [[love]] her.

==Plot==
The film opens with Elaine, a beautiful young witch, driving to [[Arcata, California]], to start a new life after the death of her husband Jerry. It is heavily implied that Elaine murdered him. Once there she rents a room in a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home owned by Elaine's mentor Barbara and kept up by its interior decorator, Trish Manning. In an attempt to befriend the young woman, Trish takes Elaine to a teahouse, where she is met by her husband Richard, who is instantly besotted with Elaine after meeting her gaze. Hoping to find a new lover, Elaine performs a ritual to find a new man and soon meets Wayne, a literature professor at the local college.

The two travel to Wayne's cabin, where she gets him to drink a concoction containing hallucinogens. The two have sex, after which Wayne becomes emotional and clingy, which proves to be a turnoff for Elaine. He dies the next day and Elaine buries his body along with a [[witch bottle]]. She decides that the next man she will try to seduce will be Richard. While Trish is away, Elaine invites him over to her apartment, where she also serves him a concoction.  Afterwards Richard becomes obsessed with Elaine, causing her to break up with him.

Unbeknownst to Elaine, one of Wayne's colleagues has reported him missing, leading to police officer Griff to investigate and discover Wayne's body and Elaine's witch bottle. He traces it to Elaine but falls in love with her and initially refuses to believe that she would be capable of murder, much to the ire of his partner Steve. Elaine shares his love and believes him to be the man of her dreams, even going so far as to hold a mock wedding with her coven at a Renaissance faire.

Meanwhile Richard, morose, kills himself in his bathtub, where he is discovered by Trish. Despondent, Trish invites Elaine to tea again and tries on a ring that Griff gave Elaine during their mock wedding, only to forget to return the ring to Elaine. Trish decides to leave the ring inside Elaine's apartment but in doing so discovers a shrine to Elaine's dead lovers—and that her husband was one of them. She is discovered by Elaine and the two fight before Trish leaves the apartment. Elaine then goes to the cabaret to meet Griff, who confronts her over the deaths of Wayne and Richard. He tells her that she is tied to both of them by DNA evidence left in Wayne's witch bottle and that the items Trish gave him implicate her in Richard's suicide. Despite his earlier love, Griff is unwilling to let Elaine go unpunished. Their conversation is overheard by the cabaret patrons who are prejudiced towards witches and try to harm Elaine. Griff helps her escape, and the two return to her apartment where she enacts her vengeance on him for not loving her properly.
