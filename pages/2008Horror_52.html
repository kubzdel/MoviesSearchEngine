'''''The Dead Outside''''' is a 2008 Scottish [[Horror film|horror/thriller]] film, the feature debut of director Kerry Anne Mullaney (who also co-wrote the film), produced [[independent film|independently]] by Mothcatcher Films.

== Synopsis ==
Set in a world devastated by a neurological [[pandemic]], the film focuses on two survivors, April Scott and Daniel, who meet on an isolated farm in Scotland. April is immune to the disease and Daniel tries to get her to see someone about it as she might be the answer to a cure for the disease. April refuses to do so. Another woman, Kate, makes her way to the farm and is allowed to stay for the night. Kate is a nurse and when she understands April's potential value as a cure, she drugs her and attempts to kidnap her and take her back to the medical experts for further study. It is revealed that April had already escaped from a medical lab where experiments had been performed on her. Kate's car crashes and Daniel is able to catch up and help April back to the safety of the farm. Kate becomes infected with the disease and is killed by April when she tries to kill Daniel.

Though ostensibly a [[zombie film]], the film concentrates on the psychological states of the lead characters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/horror-where-girlie-meets-gory-860875.html|title=Horror: Where girlie meets gory|last=Johnson|first=Andrew|date=6 July 2008|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News and Media |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>
