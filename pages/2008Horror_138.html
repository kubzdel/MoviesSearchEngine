== Plot ==
Two vampire sisters, Vera (Jenny Lampa) and Vanja (Ruth Vega Fernandez), attend an illegal club. At the club, Vera is sexually harassed by a biker (Peter Järn). She drags him into the bathroom, pretending to accept having sex with him. Vera kills the biker with her [[pocket knife]] and drinks his blood. Vera and Vanja escapes the scene. The biker's gang gives them chase wanting revenge. 

The narration intercuts with events from previous nights. Vera and Vanja belong to a breed of vampires, who are human-like but can only survive on blood. Both of the sisters are homeless. Vanja plans to try to live with her secret human boyfriend and pass off as a regular human, having heard a rumor that other vampires have done this. Vanja tries to avoid killing humans and steals blood from hospitals to feed her cravings.

After having been found by the bikers Vera and Vanja escape through the [[Stockholm]] Ghost Park and are separated. Vera is picked up by a Taxi Driver, representing humanity ([[David Dencik]]). The driver seem friendly at first but when he finds out she does not have any money to pay him he asks for oral sex. Vera attacks and kills him.

Vera and Vanja are reunited at a midnight theatre showing [[Night of the Living Dead]] and Vanja tells Vera about her plan. Vera panics with the idea of not living with her sister and betrays their location to one of the bikers (Jörgen Persson) as he is talking to his friend (Omid Khansari). The bikers chase the sisters down to a warehouse. Vera has a change of heart and confronts the bikers as Vanja escapes. Vera admits to the bikers killing their friend and meets her end at their hands.
