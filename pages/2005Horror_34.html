Inspired during a 2004 Florida camping trip when he discovered several raccoons seeming to work in a coordinated effort scavenging his campsite,<ref name="CD"/><ref name="AN"/> 
Irvine began to research "Man vs Nature" movies and raccoons in particular, learning that [[rabid]] raccoons would act in non-typical ways to attack other animals and children, and that they have stomach bacteria that could infect the brains of humans who eat them.<ref name="CD"/>  
While studying abroad in [[London, England|London]], he developed the script that became the film.<ref name="AN"/>  
With the micro-budget of $5000, the film was shot in August 2005 in the Athens and Columbus areas of Ohio.<ref name="CD"/>  
Most cast and crew members have Ohio connections and producer Colin Scianamblo grew up with Irvine in Bexley.<ref name="CD"/><ref>

Tom Lyons, who played the role of The Mayor and who works at the OhioHealth media center spoke of Irvine and Scianmblo, "They’re both [[Bexley High School]] kids who interned for me about five or six years ago.<ref name="CD"/>

marked it as the first [[feature film]] to ever be successfully completed by [[Ohio University]] communications undergraduate students.<ref name="OU"/>  
The film has been remarked upon as being the first known feature in cinema history to star an assortment of real, dead, frozen animals, rather than live, trained, stuffed, animitronic, or puppet raccoons.<ref name="OU"/><ref name="Troma">

The most important "effect" for the film was going to be the raccoons themselves, and Irvine consulted with experts at Ohio State University as he had initially planned on having raccoons prepared by a taxidemist.<ref name="AN"/>  
He was disappointed when he learned that it could cost hundreds of dollars just to have a single animal prepared, but the expert advised him of the usefulness of using frozen animals that could then be thawed, positioned, frozen, and thawed and then frozen for repeated repositionings, so production used seven legally donated frozen raccoons in this manner to create the killer coons.<ref name="ID"/><ref name="AN"/>

The film first premiered December 30, 2005 and had its festival debut at the annual [[Tromadance Festival|Tromadance Film Festival]] on January 28, 2006, in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]],<ref name="CoC">{{cite web|url=http://crankedoncinema.com/reviews/2005/coons-night-bandits-night|title=''Coons!

==Reception==
Jason Buchanan, reviewer for [[All Movie Guide]] wrote, "The laughs flow like rabies-infected blood in this gruesome horror comedy about a group of college campers besieged by a pack of killer raccoons".<ref name="AMG"/>  Peter Syslo of Infernal Dreams wrote, "''Coons!'' turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, due to the title and the subject matter, but I really think that these guys turned out a truly funny horror comedy",<ref name="ID"/> while Jamie Lisk of Cranked on Cinema wrote, "While lacking the polish of a [[Lloyd Kaufman]] opus, the mindset to offend is the same", "(Coons)  will not appeal to everybody, that’s definitely for sure. I’m guessing that this film will end up with more detractors than admirers, but if you’re like me, you’ll enjoy the film’s get-up-and-go, especially if your personal get-up-and-go already got up and went two, four or six beers ago. Irvine should be commended for crafting a fast-paced, Benny-Hill-on-crack kind of crazy, slice of sophomore cinema, one that doesn’t shy away from offering its young male target demographic what it wants – lots of blood, guts and silly, inane hilarity", and "Typical of indie films, some of the main actors have dual or triple roles here, and terrible fake moustaches are employed to help the audience separate them from each other. Dear god!"<ref name="CoC"/>  Reviewer Adam Jackson of [[The Lantern]] wrote, "The movie was overzealous in its use of human feces as a source of comedy", "Even the most sophomoric of frat guys could get tired of the movie's use of fart and pooping sounds as a supply of comedy", and "The film's special effects are, surprisingly, one the film's strongest assets".<ref name="LL"/>  
Ohio University's ''The Outlook'' reported that, "''COONS!'' has already taken major steps to solidifying itself as a cult sensation",<ref name="OU"/> while [[The Lantern]] reports that the Drexel Theater showings were held over for an additional 3 weeks due to public demand for the film, and that they plan to launch midnight weekend movies starting March 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2006/02/20/Arts/Killer.Raccoons.Will.Not.Die.At.Drexel-1620180.shtml|title=Killer raccoons will not die at Drexel|last=Mann|first=Steven|date=February 20, 2006|publisher=The Lantern|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>  When the film screened at the 2007 Fright Night Film Festival in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], reviewer Troy H. King reported, "These guys just got picked up by [[Troma Entertainment|TROMA]] which was great for them and while watching you can tell why: It was like I time warped back to [[USA Network|USA]]'s ''[[USA Up All Night|Up All Night]]''. Funny stuff! I'll be buying this movie."<ref name="FNFF"/>
