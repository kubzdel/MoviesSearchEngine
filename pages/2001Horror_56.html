'''''Mimic 2''''' is a 2001 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]], directed by [[Jean de Segonzac]], with a script inspired by a short story of the same name by [[Donald A. Wollheim]]. The movie was a direct-to-DVD sequel to ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997), and was followed by ''[[Mimic 3: Sentinel]]'' (2003).

The thriller stars long-time film veteran [[Edward Albert]], along with Alix Koromzay (returning from the original film), [[Bruno Campos]] and [[Jon Polito]].

==Plot==
Four years after the events of the first film, after three men are discovered hideously mutilated (their faces have been removed) and strung up among New York City's high-tension wires, Detective Klaski ([[Bruno Campos]]) stumbles upon a link: Each of the men knew [[entomologist]] Remy (Alix Koromzay), a teacher at an inner-city high school. Klaski considers Remy to be a prime, albeit unlikely, suspect in the killings until he witnesses for himself the shape-shifting creature that has been stalking Remy: an intelligent mutant insect with the face of its previous victim. It wants to mate with Remy. Klaski, Remy and a pair of her students get trapped inside the school as the creature hunts them down.Remy gets separated and runs into the creature who does not harm her but seems interested. Meanwhile, a special forces unit, headed by the militant leader known only as Darksuit ([[Edward Albert]]), gets ready to fumigate the school with poisonous gas.

After all the trapped humans seem to have escaped the fumigation, and with the help of a heroic Klaski in Remy's case, inspection teams following through find the creature's recently vacated [[husk]] and, later on, the mangled corpse of Klaski.

It appears that the creature, impersonating Klaski, has been caring for Remy's well-being with a mind to fulfill its base purpose. Unfortunately for it, when they finally meet in a suspenseful setting in Remy's apartment, she decapitates it. However, it is not dead as cockroaches can live up to two weeks without a head and Remy and one of the students, who is now living with her, are left wondering how to handle the situation.

==Reception==
The film received negative reviews. Christabel Padmore from Apollo Movie Guide said "The only reason you might watch ''Mimic 2'' is if you're a fan of some of the special effects used in the first movie." "There's nothing particularly wrong with ''Mimic 2'', as B-movie monster movies go," judged Keith Brown from Eye for Film. "''Mimic 2'' is the very definition of an arbitrary sequel: it essentially remakes its little-loved predecessor, which combined Cronenbergian weird science, Alien-style claustrophobia, and abundant gore to little discernible effect," wrote Nathan Rabin from ''[[The Onion]]''. eFilmCritic reviewer Jack Sommersby called "incompetent and unimaginative on just about every level". The Horror Review felt "Though it doesn’t set any genre or cinematic precedence, it does take the time to develop character relationships, create atmosphere, and establish dread within its viewer, resulting in an enjoyable second outing that, in many respects, trumps its forerunner." The publication gave it 4 out of 5 stars. The film currently holds 8% positives critics on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and 4.5 out of 10 on [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] as of March 2015.
