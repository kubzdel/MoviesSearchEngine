Meanwhile, a bed-ridden John Kramer has his apprentice [[Amanda Young]] kidnap Jeff's wife, [[List of Saw characters#Lynn Denlon|Lynn]], who is tasked with keeping Kramer alive for one final test before he dies.

Development began right after the successful opening weekend of ''[[Saw II]]''. Filming took place in [[Toronto]] from May to June 2006.

==Plot==
[[Saw II|After being left in the bathroom to die]], [[Eric Matthews (Saw)| Detective Eric Matthews]] breaks his foot with a toilet lid to escape his shackle. Six months later, the aftermath of a Jigsaw "game" is discovered by a [[SWAT]] team. The victim was meant to rip chains from his body in order to escape from a bomb. Detective Allison Kerry arrives at the scene, and points out that the room's exit was welded shut, breaking [[Jigsaw (Saw franchise)|Jigsaw]]'s [[modus operandi]] of giving his victims a chance to survive. While reviewing the videotape, she is abducted and awakens in a harness hooked into her ribs. Kerry manages to retrieve the key from the vat of acid and unlock it before the timer expires, but it kills her anyway.

Dr. Lynn Denlon is abducted from the hospital where she works and brought to the bedridden John Kramer. His apprentice, Amanda, locks a collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to John's heart rate monitor and will detonate if John dies or Lynn moves out of range. She is instructed by Amanda to keep him alive until another victim has completed his game. The other victim Jeff, wakes up in a box and learns that he must undergo tests which will lead him to the man who killed his son Dylan in a drunk driving accident. Jeff became unstable and vengeful as a result and now neglects his daughter.

Jeff's first test leads him into a meat freezer. He finds Danica Scott, the only witness of Dylan's death, who refused to testify in court; she is stripped naked and chained at the wrists between two poles which begin spraying her with ice-cold water. Jeff attempts to reach the key which is behind the frozen bars as Danica manages to convince Jeff to help her, but she freezes to death before he can retrieve it.

Judge Halden, who gave Dylan's killer six months in jail, is chained at the neck. Large rotting pigs drop into a liquidizer and fill the vat so Halden will drown, as the machine speeds up, Jeff sets fire to a cage full of Dylan's toys in order to retrieve the key and saves Halden before he drowns. His third test involves Timothy Young, Dylan's killer, who is strapped to a machine that will twist his limbs and neck until they break. The key is tied to the trigger of an enclosed shotgun. Jeff accidentally kills Halden when he takes the key and is unable to stop the machine before Young's neck breaks.

Meanwhile, Lynn is forced to perform an improvised surgery to remove pressure on John's brain. Over the course of time, Amanda grows increasingly jealous of Lynn's interaction with John, who continues to reprimand her for being rude. It is only when John suffers a seizure that Amanda is willing to cooperate with Lynn. During the surgery, John hallucinates about [[Jill Tuck|another woman]] and declares his love out loud. This upsets Amanda and when she leaves, she finds a letter which drives her to hysterics. Amanda returns with the news that Jeff has completed his tests, but refuses to remove Lynn's collar. She reveals that she no longer believes in John's philosophy which is why her traps are inescapable. She also reveals that she fought with Detective Matthews after he escaped the bathroom and left him for dead.

Refusing to listen to John's warnings, Amanda shoots Lynn just as Jeff arrives. He retaliates by shooting Amanda with a gun provided by John after his tests. As Amanda dies, John reveals that Lynn's test was actually hers: aware of her modus operandi, and unwilling to allow a murderer to inherit his legacy, he decided to test her. It is then revealed that Jeff is, in fact, Lynn's husband. John then addresses Jeff, offering to call an ambulance for Lynn if he accepts one last test: he can choose to kill John or forgive him. Jeff tells John he forgives him, but slashes his throat with a power saw. The door to the room seals as John plays a final tape, which tells Jeff that he has failed his test by killing John, the only person who knows the whereabouts of his daughter. The tape ends as John dies, and the collar detonates and kills Lynn, leaving Jeff trapped in the room with the three corpses: Amanda Young and Jigsaw and Lynn.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
[[Darren Lynn Bousman]], director and co-writer of ''[[Saw II]]'', [[James Wan]], director of ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', and [[Leigh Whannell]], screenwriter on both, turned down the offer to make a third film in the [[Saw (franchise)|franchise]]. ''Saw II'' producer [[Gregg Hoffman]] died a few weeks after its release. Bousman, Wan and Whannell got together to have lunch the day they heard of Hoffman's passing and decided to make ''Saw III'' in dedication to Hoffman.<ref name="ComingSoonBousman">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=17120|title=Exclusive: Saw III's Darren Lynn Bousman|last=Douglas|first=Edward|work=ComingSoon.net|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=October 24, 2006|accessdate=September 12, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61eqmJtcT?url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=17120|archivedate=September 13, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Whannell aimed to make ''Saw III'' more emotional, describing the plot as essentially a father-daughter "love story" between Jigsaw and Amanda.<ref name="BousmanWhannellJoblo">{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/interview-bousman-whannell|title=Interview Bousman & Whannell|publisher=[[Joblo.com]]|last=Topel|first=Fred|date=October 27, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hgyQe1o?url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/interview-bousman-whannell|archivedate=September 14, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 
[[File:James Wan and Leigh Whannell Saw 3D premiere.jpg|thumb|left|Wan (left) and Whannell (right) returned to write ''Saw III'' and also served as executive producers.]]
Bousman said they did not intend to have a twist ending, as distinctly as the previous films,  noting that "I think most people will figure it out in the first 15 minutes of the film". Whannell added, "What Darren and I struck for ''Saw III'' was to have an emotionally impactful ending." As with the previous two films, the ending was only given to the actors who appeared in the final scene at the time it was filmed. At one point the script was stolen from Bousman's chair; however, it was returned before it was leaked online.<ref name="Lionsgate Home Entertainment">{{cite video|title=The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]|people=[[David Hackl]] (production designer)|date=2007 | accessdate=September 14, 2011|time=4:15–4:23}}</ref>

===Casting===
Soomekh became close with Lionsgate after appearing in their film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004) and they wanted her in their next big film. Not a fan of horror films she found the role challenging. "I had nightmares the first month I was on set.", she said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/742/742130p1.html|title=Interview: Bahar Soomekh and Angus Macfadyen|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|page=1|date=October 27, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hm9gApG?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/742/742130p1.html|archivedate=September 15, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Filming===
''Saw III'' was given a larger budget of $10 million,<ref>{{cite news|title=Saw's Unkindest Cutssaw's Unkindest Cuts|last=Alexander|first=Chris|work=[[Toronto Star]]|publisher=[[Torstar]]|date=June 11, 2006}}</ref> compared to ''Saw II''{{'}}s $4 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2611799&page=1|title=Evolution of Scary Movies|last=Rooney|first=Brian|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=October 27, 2006|accessdate=August 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/617rX6x73?url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=2611799&page=1|archivedate=August 22, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] took place for 27 days<ref name="ComingSoonBousman"/> at [[Toronto]]'s [[Cinespace Film Studios]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=Michael|journal=[[Fangoria]]|title=SAW III: Deadlier Lessons|issn=0164-2111|number=257|date=October 2006|pages=30}}</ref> from {{nowrap|May 8, 2006}}, to late June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lionsgate-and-twisted-pictures-rip-into-saw-iii-as-latest-film-in-powerhouse-horror-franchise-starts-principal-photography-in-toronto-56092217.html|title=Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures Rip Into SAW III as Latest Film in Powerhouse Horror Franchise Starts Principal Photography in Toronto|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|date=May 6, 2006|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61elqG8kU?url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lionsgate-and-twisted-pictures-rip-into-saw-iii-as-latest-film-in-powerhouse-horror-franchise-starts-principal-photography-in-toronto-56092217.html|archivedate=September 13, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>   Production borrowed the bathroom set used in ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', which parodied the franchise.<ref name="BousmanWhannellJoblo"/>  Almost all the transitions from one place to another were not made using digital effects; the transitions were shot on the spot. For example, when the camera moves from Troy's crime scene to Kerry being in the bathtub, Meyer had to run, take off all her clothes, and jump into the tub.<ref name="BousmanWhannellJoblo"/> Visually the film is akin to the previous two with using quick cuts and fast-paced rhythms. Bousman said, "We're using a lot of [[whip pan]]s and [[wiktionary:flash frame|flash frames]] to create a dynamic feel". [[Post-production]] services were provided by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group Inc.|Deluxe]].<ref name="ProdNotes">{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/saw3/notes.pdf|title=Saw III Production Notes|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]|accessdate=September 18, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61mkbbU6q?url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/saw3/notes.pdf|archivedate=September 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===Trap designs===
Bousman described the hardest scene to film was the "Pig Scene", explaining that they had to rush and it involved filming "so many moving parts".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-saw-iiis-director-darren-lynn-bousman|title=EXCLUSIVE: Saw III's Director Darren Lynn Bousman|publisher=MovieWeb|date=October 26, 2006|accessdate=September 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hkevan5?url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/exclusive-saw-iiis-director-darren-lynn-bousman|archivedate=September 15, 2011|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The pig carcasses were made out of foam, rubber and latex.<ref name="Lionsgate Home Entertainment"/> The pig props had live disinfected [[maggot]]s attached with honey.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Details of Death: The Props of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment|people=David Hackl (production designer)|date=2007 | accessdate=September 14, 2011|time=6:40–7:35}}</ref>

For "The Rack Trap", Whannell originally conceived it as a trap that would fold a person into a box, though it eventually morphed into the twisting of body parts.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Traps of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment|people=Leigh Whannell (writer)|date=2007 | accessdate=September 14, 2011|time=1:27–1:51}}</ref>  Bousman wanted to have a trap that involved freezing someone to death since the films had already touched on burning to death, bleeding to death and being cut to death. A body cast was made of Debra Lynn McCabe for "The Freezer Room" trap, but because of safety regulations a person cannot be entombed, so only a front or back body cast could be on the actress at any given time.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Traps of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment|people=Darren Lynn Bousman (director), Leigh Whannell (writer), Debra Lynn McCabe (actor)|date=2007 | accessdate=September 14, 2011|time=4:50–5:40}}</ref>  For bathroom trap the "Classroom Trap", J. Larose's character was originally going to be hanged from the ceiling by meat hooks, but it was decided against since he would not have been able to rip the chains out himself (as the script called for). It proved to be a challenge since it was done with [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetics]] and [[practical effect]]s.<ref name="ProdNotes"/><ref>{{cite video|title=The Traps of Saw III|medium=DVD|publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment|people=Darren Lynn Bousman (director), Leigh Whannell play  adam   |date=2007 | accessdate=September 14, 2011|time=6:23–6:59}}</ref>

[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]'s president of theatrical marketing [[Tim Palen]] thought of the idea to make 1,000 posters with a small amount of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, "I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said I was dead serious." The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the [[Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117951593|title=Inside Move: 'Saw' gets into bloody vein for promo poster|last=McClintock|first=Pamela|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=October 9, 2006|accessdate=September 12, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61edOe9qM?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117951593|archivedate=September 12, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Lionsgate also held the third annual "Give Til It Hurts" [[Blood donation|blood drive]] for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.94aae335470e233f6cf911df43181aa0/?vgnextoid=d45cc92887b6b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD|title=American Red Cross Partners With Lionsgate on SAW IV Blood Drive|publisher=[[Red Cross]]|date=August 6, 2007|accessdate=September 12, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61eiTSBkv?url=http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.94aae335470e233f6cf911df43181aa0/?vgnextoid=d45cc92887b6b110VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD|archivedate=September 13, 2011|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Robert Koehler gave the film a mixed review.  He criticized the use of several flashbacks in the film, saying that it "[...] hinder[ed] the movie, ratcheting down its tension and pace".
