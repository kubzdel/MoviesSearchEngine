==Plot==
Fifteen years ago, Edwin (Jared Herholtz) went to clown camp to fulfill his lifelong dream of bringing laughter to the world, however nobody laughed. Humiliated on graduation night, Edwin viciously murdered the entire camp before vanishing into legend.

But, despite the warnings of the town drunk, Bonzo ([[Mike Miller (actor)|Mike Miller]]) has reopened the ranch and a new class of clowns have unwittingly signed up. When their die-hard instructor Sgt. Funnybone ([[Miguel Martinez (actor)|Miguel Martinez]]) is found dead in a puddle of cream pie and blood, the curriculum changes from comedy to survival. Edwin slashes, stabs, strangles, and disembowels the clowns while laughing insanely at his own bad jokes.
