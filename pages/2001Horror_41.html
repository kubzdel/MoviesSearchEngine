'''''From Hell''''' is a 2001 American [[mystery film|mystery]] [[horror film]] directed by the [[Hughes brothers]] and loosely based on the graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]] about the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders.

==Plot==

In 1888, [[Mary Jane Kelly|Mary Kelly]] ([[Heather Graham]]) and her small group of [[London]] prostitutes trudge through unrelenting daily misery. When their friend Ann Crook ([[Joanna Page]]) is kidnapped, they are drawn into a [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] with links to high society. The kidnapping is followed by the gruesome murder of another woman, [[Martha Tabram]] ([[Samantha Spiro]]); and it becomes apparent that they are being hunted down one by one as prostitutes are murdered and mutilated post-mortem.

The murder of Martha and her companions grabs the attention of [[Whitechapel]] [[Police Inspector]] [[Frederick Abberline]] ([[Johnny Depp]]), a brilliant, yet troubled, man whose police work is often aided by his [[psychic]] "visions." His colleague, Sergeant Peter Godley ([[Robbie Coltrane]]), tries to grasp his friend's wild theories. Abberline's investigations reveal that the murders, while gruesome, imply that an educated person is responsible due to the precise and almost surgical method used. Ann is found a few days later in a [[workhouse]] having been [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] after officials and doctors supposedly found her to be insane, though it is implied this was done to silence her. 

Abberline consults [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a physician to the Royal Family, drawing on his experience and knowledge of medicine. During this meeting, it is revealed Abberline is struggling with [[opium addiction]]. Gull's findings, coupled with his superiors impeding his investigations, point Abberline to a darker and more organized conspiracy than he originally thought. Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love.

Abberline deduces that [[Freemason]] influence is definitely present in these crimes. His superior, a high ranking Freemason himself, then makes direct intervention and suspends Abberline. It is then revealed that Gull is the killer. He has been killing the witnesses to painter [[Walter Sickert|Albert Sickert]] ([[Mark Dexter]])'s forbidden [[Catholic]] marriage to Crook, who bore his legitimate daughter, Alice. Sickert is actually [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert]], grandson of reigning [[Queen Victoria]] (Liz Moscrop), and therefore Alice is heiress to the British throne. Gull tells Abberline that "mankind will remember him for giving birth to the 20th century." Abberline draws his gun, vowing that Gull will never see the 20th century, but before he is able to shoot Gull, he is knocked out by Ben Kidney, another Freemason.

The Freemasons try to have Abberline eliminated without leaving any witnesses, but Abberline fights back and kills two of the assassins by overturning a carriage. Gull himself is a Freemason and his increasingly sinister behavior lends an insight into his murderous, but calculated, mind. Rather than publicly charge Gull, the Freemasons decide to [[lobotomy|lobotomize]] him to protect themselves and the Royal Family from the scandal. Gull defiantly states he has no equal among men, remaining unrepentant up to his lobotomy, resulting in him becoming invalid just as Ann had been.

Abberline tries to save Mary, but arrives too late, and blames his superior for not helping  him or Godley on the cases. Abberline does nothing but watch Mary's mutilated body being taken away. Abberline receives a mysterious letter, which he soon realizes is from Mary, but he decides not to look for her as a way to offer her protection, as the Freemasons may be watching his every move. Abberline decides to burn the letter, knowing that he can never have a normal life.

Mary Kelly was not killed; Gull mistook Ada, whom Liz said was from France (but is from Brussels in Belgium), for Mary and he killed her instead. Mary lives with Alice as her daughter in a cottage on a cliff by the sea. Abberline is found dead of an [[opium]] [[drug overdose|overdose]], knowing he can never see Mary again without endangering her. Sergeant Godley comes to pay his respects for the Inspector.
