==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2015}}
Critical reception for the film was mixed.  [[Bloody Disgusting]] awarded the film a score of 2 / 4 stating, "''The Bunny Game'' is a well shot and expertly edited work, but it’s not a film in the conventional sense. It’s more of a vicious visceral experience. Because of the style and the wholesale devotion of Getsic and Refro, ''The Bunny Game'' is captivating, but ultimately not an experience worth having".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harley|first1=David|title=[BD Review] ‘The Bunny Game’ Doesn’t Play Nice|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3157563/bd-review-the-bunny-game-doesnt-play-nice/|website=Bloody Disgusting.com|publisher=David Harley|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>
