==Filming==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
The documentary footage is of the real Gary Ridgway confessing to the killings.

The flashback of Ridgway's fictional "mentor," Boris, has a distinctly different look and atmosphere compared with the rest of the movie. That is because the footage was not shot by director Ulli Lommel but by [[German people|German]] actor-director "[[Marian Dora]]," a pseudonym for the physician who began making gory horror films around the same time Lommel directed ''Green River Killer.'' Dora made ''[[Cannibal (2006 film)|Cannibal – Aus dem Tagebuch des Kannibalen]]'', for example. Dora, who also worked on Lommel's ''[[Zombie Nation (film)|Zombie Nation]]'', in this flashback directs actor Carsten Frank as he strangles a woman.

''Green River Killer'' was the second in a series of direct-to-[[DVD]] titles directed by Lommel and released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] under its Artisan label. The first was ''[[Zodiac Killer (film)|Zodiac Killer]]'' (2005). ''Green River Killer'' would soon to be followed by ''[[BTK Killer (film)|BTK Killer]]'' (2005) and ''[[Killer Pickton (film)|Killer Pickton]]'' (2005). Other direct-to-DVD movies directed by Lommel and featuring serial killers would follow in 2007 and 2008.

Ridgway's home in the movie, which is a residence located in [[Marina del Rey, California]], was also the house inhabited by "Producer McCoon" in ''[[Black Dahlia (film)|Black Dahlia]]'' (2006).
