==Plot==
The film tells the story of a young mother of two, Alejandra, who is unhappy in her marriage to her husband Ángel. Her brother, Fabián, is having a passionate affair with her husband and is a nurse at the local hospital. At his job he meets Veronica, a young woman who is infatuated with a strange tentacle-like monster that an older couple keep in a barn. Eventually Veronica convinces Fabián to visit the barn. 

One night they all go out together dancing, Ángel confronts Fabián about their relationship with Veronica and it eventually escalates into a fight. Two days later Ángel visits Fabián at his work and confronts him about their relationship, Fabián tells him that their affair is over and he no longer wants to see him. A few days later Fabián appears in a farm field, naked, mutilated, and severely beaten. As he lays in the hospital in a coma, Alejandra learns about his affair with Ángel by looking through Fabián's text messages. 

One of Fabián's co-workers remembers the altercation he had prior with Ángel and discloses what he saw to the police, which leads to Ángel being arrested and imprisoned. Eventually Alejandra finds her way to the barn as well, there the couple tell her of a meteorite that landed and how the tentacle-like monster came to be. She is drugged by the couple and escorted into the barn. She continues to go back to the barn and has continuous [[Tentacle erotica|sexual encounters with the tentacled monster]]. 

Ángel is bonded out of jail and goes to visit Alejandra in hopes of reuniting his family, he becomes angry at her blocking his advances and pulls out a gun but shoots his knee by mistake. Alejandra moves him into her truck and takes him to the barn, she opens the door and finds that Veronica is now dead and moves Ángel into the room with the monster. The film ends with Alejandra helping move dead bodies into a pile at the edge of the forest.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-untamed-review-1201852117/|title=Film Review: ‘The Untamed’|last=Lodge|first=Guy|date=5 September 2016|work=Variety|access-date=5 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>
