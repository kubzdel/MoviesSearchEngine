==Plot==
A clique of six friends separate after their graduation from college: Hye-jin continues to pursue her tertiary education, Seon-ae moves to the [[United States]], Jung-wook works as a lawyer, Se-hun opens an art studio while preparing for his directorial debut, Mi-ryeong becomes an actress, and Hyun-jun is stuck as a construction worker due to the cast on his leg. Seon-ae returns home and tells Hye-jin and Se-hun about the deceased Kyung-ah pursuing her. Back when they were in college, the clique decided to include a new member, Eun-ju, whom Hye-jin befriended at a botanical garden. Hyun-jun fell in love with her at first sight, much to the disappointment of Seon-ae, who was in love with him. Seon-ae made Eun-ju a scapegoat for the misfortunes that the clique experienced and correctly deduced her as Kyung-ah, a girl from Seon-ae and Hye-jin's past who became an outcast for apparently causing problems around her, including the death of Hye-jin's father. Eun-ju apparently committed suicide by jumping from a building after Hye-jin rejected her.

While having sex with a prostitute, Se-hun is killed by having his eye gouged out and telephone booth glass crushing him. Down on luck, Hyun-jun blackmails Jung-wook into becoming his lawyer by threatening him with a video that could potentially scandalize him and Mi-ryeong, with whom he still maintains a relationship despite his marriage. Hyun-jun is later killed inside Se-hun's studio. Jung-wook and Mi-ryeong attempt to take the video tape, but Seon-ae has already gotten it. After dumping Jung-wook, Mi-ryeong is found dead in the shower of her bathroom.

Jung-wook tells Hye-jin that Seon-ae went to the United States to seek mental treatment, not education. Seon-ae visits Hye-jin several times to seek solace from Kyung-ah's terrors. Hye-jin takes Hyun-jun's video tape and learns that Kyung-ah was killed when she fell while attempting to strangle Jung-wook after Hye-jin rejected her, not because of suicide. Jung-wook appears and chases Seon-ae to the building where they disposed of Kyung-ah's body. He tells Hye-jin that he is the one who killed all of their friends to keep them from revealing the truth. Before he can kill them, Seon-ae impales him with a metal rod, killing him.

Some time later, Seon-ae pays visit to Hye-jin's apartment. Hye-jin tells her that they should forget everything, but Seon-ae speaks as if she is not herself. The camera turns to reveal Kyung-ah slowly slitting Seon-ae while saying "once Seon-ae is dead, we (Kyung-ah and Hye-jin) can be together...".

==DVD problems==
Tartan Video's Region 1 release of the film has a vertically stretched image, (the 1.85:1 film is presented in 1.74:1) which causes noticeable distortion of angles, as well as making everything appear thinner than it should.

==Remake==
{{main|Bunshinsaba 2}}
A Chinese remake of the film, titled ''[[Bunshinsaba 2]]'' (筆仙Ⅱ, ''Bǐxiān II''), also directed by Ahn Byeong-ki, was released on July 16, 2013, as part of a trilogy of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-language films directed by Ahn. The title refers to the director's 2004 Korean film, ''[[Bunshinsaba]]'', though none of the films in the trilogy bear any resemblance to it. It starred Xin Zhilei, [[Park Han-byul]], Zhang Haoran, Sienna Li, Sun Shaolong, Yang Fan, and Zhang Tingting. It is almost a [[shot-for-shot]] remake, aside from the setting, language, and actor changes, a few details (Hyun-jun previously played [[baseball]], whereas his Chinese counterpart, Hongrui, played [[tennis]]), and an additional scene that pays homage to the 2004 film ''Bunshinsaba''.
