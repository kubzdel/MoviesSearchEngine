== Reception ==
The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' panned the film overall, writing that "Tebo brings some admirable ambition to this microbudget project" but that "from the overwritten, pop-culture-reference-laden dialogue to the incessant attempts to be shocking, “''Happy Birthday''” tries way too hard."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-cap-feature-happy-birthday-review-20160902-snap-story.html|title=Grindhouse-style 'Happy Birthday' talks its sadistic head off|last=Murray|first=Noel|date=September 8, 2016|website=LA Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also reviewed the movie, stating "A bizarre mixture of black comedy and horror/suspense, ''Happy Birthday'' is a juvenile effort that at least has the decency to make its American and Mexican characters look equally bad."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/happy-birthday-film-review-926914|title='Happy Birthday': Film Review|last=Scheck|first=Frank|date=September 9, 2016|work=|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-12-08|via=}}</ref>

In contrast, genre website [[Bloody Disgusting]] praised the movie and felt that "the sheer originality behind ''Happy Birthday'' makes up for most of its cinematic blunders" and that "Tebo’s direction and storytelling skills shine brightly in this flawed but compelling thriller."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3404423/review-happy-birthday-surprises-clever-twists-turns/|title=[Review] 'Happy Birthday' Surprises with Clever Twists and Turns|last=H.C.|first=Luis|date=2016-08-26|work=|newspaper=Bloody Disgusting!|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-08|via=}}</ref>
