==Synopsis==
Devastated by the loss of her husband from a car accident, Audrey ([[Anna Walton]]) tries to commit suicide but is saved from death by her sister Alex ([[Emma Cleasby]]). She decides that the best course of action would be to stay in a cottage in the secluded Welsh countryside, where she will try to overcome her loss and her personal feelings of guilt about her husband's death. On her first day there Audrey meets local Theresa (Tanya Myers) and her husband Dr. Zellaby ([[Nick Brimble]]), who tell her about the cottage's previous owner, Douglas ([[Tom Wisdom]]), that died 30 years prior due to suicide. Soon Audrey begins to hear strange noises and discovers a locked door, which Zellaby states has not been opened since Douglas's death. Eventually the noises become too much for her and Audrey forces the door open to discover that it has many various items belonging to Douglas, including letters from his fiancee Nell (Rebecca Kiser). At this point Douglas begins to manifest himself within the house, revealing himself to Audrey. The two are able to converse with one another but cannot physically interact and they begin to form an emotional bond. However, as time passes the question arises as to whether or not Douglas is truly a kindred spirit or something more sinister.

==Development and rating==
Carolyn was inspired to create ''Soulmate'' after getting lost in the English countryside, where she discovered "this spooky little village hidden in a hollow, on a dark cloudy day."<ref name=RM>{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: AXELLE CAROLYN (SOULMATE)|url=http://rue-morgue.com/2014/10/interview-axelle-carolyn-soulmate/|publisher=Rue Morgue|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> She also liked the idea of "finding comfort in the supernatural ... because if there are ghosts, there's an afterlife, and the people you've lost are not gone forever."<ref name=STYD>{{cite web|last1=Turek|first1=Ryan|title=Axelle Carolyn’s Soulmate to Make U.S. Premiere|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/351573-axelle-carolyn-soulmate-to-make-us-premiere/|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> Finding an appropriate filming location caused some difficulties, as she wanted to find a cottage that was "small enough to be cozy and atmospheric, but large enough to accommodate a film crew".<ref name=RM /> As the film's crew was unable to afford tents or trailers for the duration of filming, crew members would have to perform their work in unoccupied rooms of the cottage and relocate as needed for film shots.<ref name=RM />

Prior to the release the film was met with resistance from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), who found the opening scene of Audrey attempting suicide by slicing her wrists to be objectionable.<ref name=SFN>{{cite web|last1=Hatfull|first1=Jonathan|title=AXELLE CAROLYN’S SOULMATE FACING BBFC CUTS|url=http://www.scifinow.co.uk/news/axelle-carolyns-soulmate-facing-bbfc-cuts/|publisher=SciFiNow|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=BBFC>{{cite web|title=SOULMATE|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/soulmate-video|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> The BBFC required that Carolyn remove 16 seconds of footage to receive an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]].<ref name=WO /> The proposed removal centered predominantly upon footage of the knife or Audrey's wrists and ultimately Carolyn chose to remove the scene in its entirety,<ref name=BBFC /> as she felt that removing only portions of the scene would result in a "mangled, limp version that would’ve diminished the impact needed and made Audrey’s suicide attempt look painless and easy."<ref name=WO /> The BBFC's decision was met with some derision by media and Internet bloggers, and multiple people mentioned films that contained objectionable elements such as gory death scenes (''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]''),<ref>{{cite web|title=HOSTEL (2006)|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/hostel-2006|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> necrophilia (''[[Nekromantik]]''),<ref>{{cite web|title=NEKROMANTIK (1987)|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/nekromantik-1987|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> or extended rape scenes (''[[Irréversible]]'')<ref>{{cite web|title=IRREVERSIBLE (2003)|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/irreversible-2003|publisher=BBFC|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> without requiring edits.<ref name=WO /><ref name=DC>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Staci Layne|title=Fast 5 Questions for Axelle Carolyn About Soulmate|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/76320/fast-5-questions-axelle-carolyn-soulmate/|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=Axelle Carolyn Forced to Cut SOULMATE|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/movie-news/9106-movie-news-axelle-carolyn-forced-to-cut-soulmate|publisher=Starburst Magazine|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> The opening scene is present in some international versions of the film.<ref name="DC review">{{cite web|title=Soulmate ( review)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/78123/soulmate-dvd/|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==
''Nerdly'' gave ''Soulmate'' a favorable review, writing "Traditional ghost stories are few and far between these days, you’re more likely to find a ghost at the end of a camcorder than conversing with the living in most movies and so ''Soulmate'' actually feels, despite its traditionalism, fresh and new."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=Frightfest 2013: ‘Soulmate’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2013/10/26/frightfest-2013-soulmate-review/|publisher=Nerdly|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> ''[[Dread Central]]'' was mostly positive in their review, giving the film an overall rating of four stars but noted that the ending was too open for interpretation for their liking.<ref name="DC review" /> ''HorrorNews.net'' was also mostly positive, noting that the film would not appeal to all audiences and that "Fans of romantic, period piece fear feasts that challenge you will surely not be disappointed."<ref name=HN.N>{{cite web|last1=Gammon|first1=Dave|title=Film Review: Soulmate|url=http://horrornews.net/89355/film-review-soulmate-2013/|publisher=HorrorNews.net|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref> Anton Bitel of BFI panned ''Soulmate'', writing "The shrill melodrama of the film’s climax seemed out of keeping with both the creeping pace of what had preceded and the subtle ambiguity of the final scene – an ambiguity so underplayed that several FrightFesters with whom I spoke afterwards seemed, like the film’s own sceptic character Dr Zellaby, unconvinced that it was there at all."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=Night of the long backward glances: the FrightFest October All-Nighter 2013|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/comment/festivals/night-long-backward-glances-frightfest-october|publisher=BFI|accessdate=13 November 2014}}</ref>
