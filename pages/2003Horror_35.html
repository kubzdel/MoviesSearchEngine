'''''Freddy vs. Jason''''' is a 2003 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Ronny Yu]] and written by [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon|Damian Shannon]] and [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon|Mark Swift]]. The film is a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] between ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' series, and pits [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]] against each other in the eighth and eleventh installments in their respective series. The film is also the last in both ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''Friday the 13th'' series before they were both [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]].

In the film, Freddy ([[Robert Englund]]) has grown incapable of haunting people's dreams as the citizens of Springwood, Ohio, have mostly forgotten about him following his death and subsequent imprisonment in [[Hell]] for his sins. To regain his power and freedom, Freddy resurrects Jason ([[Ken Kirzinger]]) and manipulates him into traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear, leading to rumors that Freddy has returned. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, Jason angers Freddy by depriving him of potential victims. This ultimately sends the two undead monsters into a violent conflict.

''Freddy vs. Jason'' was released in the United States on August 15, 2003. It grossed $114 million, making it the highest-grossing film in the ''Friday the 13th'' series and the second-highest-grossing film in ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' series. This film marked Englund's final appearance to date as Freddy Krueger.

<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries must be generic and WITHIN 400-700 WORDS!!! As of 14 August 2016, this summary has over 435 words: IT IS STRONGLY REQUIRED TO NOT EXPAND ANY FURTHER!!!! -->

Freddy Krueger is rendered powerless in Hell because the people of Springwood manage to make the youth forget about him. Disguised as [[Pamela Voorhees]], Freddy manipulates Jason into coming back to life and start killing Springwood teenagers to regain strength. In Springwood, [[Lori Campbell]] lives with her widowed father and has her friends Kia, Gibb, Trey, and Blake staying over. That night, Jason kills Trey, and the police suspect Freddy, fearing his return. Following a [[nightmare]] where Freddy tries to kill Blake but fails because of not being powerful enough, Blake awakens to find his father beheaded before Jason kills him too. The next day, police claim it to be a [[Murder–suicide|murder-suicide]], hoping to contain Freddy.

Lori's ex-boyfriend Will Rollins and friend Mark Davis are patients at Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital. They take Hypnocil to suppress their dreams because they previously had contact with Freddy. A news report about the murders motivate Mark and Will to escape and return to Springwood in order to warn Lori about Freddy. That night, Lori and the others attend a [[rave]] on a [[Cereal|cornfield]]. Freddy tries to kill Gibb in a nightmare, but Jason kills her in the real world along with several other attendees, which causes Freddy to realize that Jason's rampage will deny him victims.

Linderman and Freeburg escape the rave along with Will, Lori, and Kia. Later, Will explains to Lori that the reason he was sent to Westin Hills was because he saw her father murder her mother, before going to Mark's house.  However, they discover Freddy killing Mark and leading a message on his body that he has returned. Deputy Stubbs approaches Lori and her friends, who realize Freddy's plan and convince him of the truth. Learning of Hypnocil, they attempt to steal it from Westin Hills and see many teenagers in a coma-like-state due to prolonged Hypnocil use, but Freddy possesses Freeburg who disposes of the medicine. Having followed them, Jason electrocutes Stubbs to death but is tranquilized by a possessed Freeburg, who Jason kills before falling asleep.

Taking Jason's body with them, the teens devise a plan to pull Freddy from the dream world into reality and force him to fight Jason. They take the unconscious Jason to the now abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Freddy battles Jason in the dream world, where Freddy has the advantage with his dream powers, and learns that Jason is afraid of water (though this is contradictory to previous ''Friday the 13th'' films) and uses this fear to render Jason powerless. Meanwhile, Lori goes to sleep and tries to save Jason. Freddy attacks her and reveals himself as her mother's killer, having possessed her father to do it.

Jason awakens at Camp Crystal Lake and chases the teens into a cabin. Linderman is killed after trying to fight Jason and the cabin ignites. Lori is awakened and manages to pull Freddy into the real world where he is confronted by Jason. As two begin to fight, the remaining teens escape the cabin.

Managing to escape Jason, Freddy goes after the teens but is distracted by Kia until Jason suddenly kills her. Freddy uses his speed and intellect, while Jason uses his strength and pain tolerance as they resume their battle. On a dock, Jason tears Freddy's clawed arm off after Freddy stabs Jason's eyes. Lori and Will attempt to kill the two by pouring gasoline on the dock and setting it ablaze, which causes the propane tanks to explode.  The blast sends the Jason and Freddy into the lake. Freddy climbs out and attempts to kill Lori and Will, but is impaled by Jason with his own clawed arm. Lori decapitates Freddy, avenging the deaths of her friends and her mother, as he falls back into the lake and sinks to the bottom. Lori and Will leave Camp Crystal Lake as the last two survivors.

The next day, Jason emerges from the water, holding his [[machete]] and Freddy's severed head, apparently the winner.  However, Freddy winks to the audience before laughing off-screen, leaving the ending ambiguous.

===Development===
Influenced by fans' desire for a crossover film depicting a fight between the two icons, New Line and Paramount tried to make a ''Freddy vs. Jason'' movie in 1987. But the two studios failed to agree on a story. When ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' failed to perform successfully at the box office, Sean Cunningham decided that he wanted to reacquire the rights to ''Friday the 13th'' and start working with New Line Cinema on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', as New Line owned ''Nightmare on Elm Street''. The concept of a fight between Freddy and Jason was not new; Paramount had approached New Line about filming a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] years before the latter had gained the licensing rights to ''Friday the 13th''. At that time, both companies wanted the license to the other's character so that they could control the making of the film. Negotiations on the project were never finalized, which led Paramount to make ''The New Blood''. After ''Jason Takes Manhattan'' was released in 1989 the rights reverted to Scuderi, Minasian, and Barsamianto, who sold them to New Line. Before Cunningham could start working on ''Freddy vs. Jason'', Wes Craven returned to New Line to make ''[[Wes Craven's New Nightmare|New Nightmare]]''. This effectively put ''Freddy vs. Jason'' on hold, but allowed Cunningham the chance to bring Jason back into the spotlight with ''Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday''.<ref name="part9">Bracke, Peter, pp.218–219</ref> The ninth installment "turned a healthy profit", though it was only intended to open the door for a crossover with Freddy Krueger, rather than start a new series for New Line.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pg. 238</ref> Cunningham's "frustration" with the delayed development of the ''Freddy vs. Jason'' project forced him to create another sequel titled ''[[Jason X]]'' in an effort to keep the series in the minds of audiences. Based on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''{{'}}s concept of taking Jason away from Crystal Lake, the tenth film would put the titular character in space.<ref name="part 10">Bracke, Peter, pp.242–243</ref> The film suffered from the loss of its biggest supporter, President of Production Michael De Luca, when he resigned from his position. Lack of support forced the finished film to sit for two years before finally being released on April 26, 2002; it would go on to become the lowest grossing film in the series at the domestic box office; it also held the distinction of having the largest budget of any of the previous films at that time.<ref>Bracke, Peter, pp.263–264</ref>

According to writers Mark Swift and Damian Shannon, several endings were considered for the film. One of the unused endings involved [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]] of the ''[[Hellraiser (franchise)|Hellraiser]]'' franchise; however, New Line was discontent with securing the rights to the character.<ref>{{cite news |last=Thurman |first=Trace |date=13 May 2016 |title=Hockey Masks, Machetes and Razor Fingers: The Writers Behind ‘Freddy Vs. Jason’ Tell All! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3390499/real-story-behind-freddy-vs-jason/ |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=4 November 2016 }}</ref> [[New Line Cinema|New Line]] believed ''Freddy vs. Jason'' needed a fresh start, and chose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing [[Kane Hodder]] was the best choice for the role.<ref name="Ken">Bracke, Peter, pp. 280–286</ref> Hodder did receive the script for ''Freddy vs. Jason'', and had a meeting with director [[Ronny Yu]] and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason.<ref name="Ken"/> According to Hodder, New Line didn't provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films.<ref name="Hiring Ken">Grove, David, p. 217</ref> The role eventually went to [[Ken Kirzinger]], a Canadian stuntman who worked on ''Jason Takes Manhattan''. There are conflicting reports over the reason Kirzinger was cast. According to Yu, Kirzinger was hired because he was taller than [[Robert Englund]], the actor who portrays Freddy Krueger. Kirzinger stands 6' 5" (196&nbsp;cm), compared to the 6' 3" (191&nbsp;cm) of [[Kane Hodder]]. Yu wanted a much larger actor to tower over the 5' 9" (175&nbsp;cm) Englund. Kirzinger believes his experience on ''Part VIII'' helped him land the part, as Kirzinger doubled for Hodder on two scenes for the film,<ref name="Ken"/> but also believes he was simply sized up and handed the job.<ref name="Hiring Ken"/> Although he was hired by the crew, New Line did not officially cast Kirzinger until first seeing him on film. Kirzinger's first scene was Jason walking down Elm Street. New Line wanted a specific movement in Jason's walk; Kirzinger met their expectations and signed a contract with the studio.<ref name="Ken"/>

In an interview, Tait explained the reason for the reshoot.{{clarify|date=December 2017|reason=What reshoot?}} He said, "Unfortunately for me, it was the only scene I was hired to do. The test audiences were confused about the original ending, they thought Jason Ritter’s character was becoming {{sic|Jason}}. You can see it in the deleted scenes, that is why they decided to reshoot the ending. Originally I was being considered for playing the role of Jason in the entire film. It was actually between me and Ken. When they took the film to Canada, I was out of luck. There was no way they were going to pay for my flight and hotel stay when Ken was a local. Also, Ken is older than me and he was a lot more established in the business than I was at the time."<ref name="fridaythe13thfilms1">[http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ Interview: Douglas Tait (Jason Voorhees, ‘Freddy vs Jason’)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016100323/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/interview-douglas-tait-jason-voorhees-freddy-vs-jason/ |date=2010-10-16 }} fridaythe13thfilms.com October 14, 2010. Retrieved April 5, 2011.</ref> Describing the scene, Tait said "I was on the film for a couple days. The water sequence took a lot of preparation. They realized that when I got wet, I looked too skinny in the clothes, so they had to bulk me up with pads and extra clothing so it would look like I was still big. Being with all this extra weight, one eye covered, a machete in one hand, Freddy’s head in another hand, and being totally submerged in water, made that scene very difficult. Also, Ronny Yu wanted me to walk like I was walking on land. He wanted it to look like I could walk through the water without it making me rise to the surface. To do this effect, they had a rope tied under water that I held onto with my left hand (with Freddy’s severed head in it also), and I held myself down on the ground so I could pull myself and walk forward."<ref name="fridaythe13thfilms1"/>
