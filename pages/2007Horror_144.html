Jenn Eblin wrote on reviewstream.com, "If you’re thinking of a way to waste an hour and a half of your life, give the movie Knock Knock a try. This movie is a complete waste of time and I don’t know how I ever sat through the whole movie." "I can handle a movie if it has a bad plot, bad acting, bad characters, a bad ending, or even bad lighting and sets. Unfortunately I can’t handle all of those things at one time in the same movie, which is what I ended up with here."<ref>[http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=39701 Knock Knock Movie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191316/http://www.reviewstream.com/reviews/?p=39701 |date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref>
