==Plot synopsis==
{{plot|date=February 2015}}
''Poultrygeist'' follows a group of consumers and ordinary citizens who are trapped inside a [[New Jersey]] [[fried chicken]] fast food restaurant – the American Chicken Bunker – which is being attacked by a [[chicken]]-possessed [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] [[demon]]ic [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] spirit because the building is erected on top of a sacred Native American [[burial ground]]. The protagonist is Arbie ([[Jason Yachanin]]), an ACB employee trying to win back the heart of his ex-girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham), an [[activism|activist]] protesting against the restaurant, who has left Arbie [[Lesbianism|for another woman]].

High school sweethearts Arbie and Wendy meet the day before Wendy's departure to college to consummate their relationship in the Tromahawk [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] [[burial ground]], promising to each other that no matter what happens, they will always stay faithful to each other. She is grossed out after finding a man jacking off to their lovemaking, but he's later killed by zombie hands spouting from the ground which tear through his system and out of his mouth, grabbing Arbie's underwear that he was masturbating with. One college semester later, when Arbie returns to the spot of his one and only sexual encounter, he is shocked to discover two unsettling realities: not only has the burial ground been bulldozed and replaced by an American Chicken Bunker, a mega-conglomerate [[fast food]] [[Franchising|franchise]], but college has turned his dear Wendy into a "[[Left-wing politics|leftist]], [[Lipstick lesbian|lipstick lesbo]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]", protesting the construction of the fried chicken menace with her [[Activism|activist]] girlfriend Micki (Allyson Sereboff).

Disillusioned and out for revenge, Arbie decides to get a job at the American Chicken Bunker. Under the supervision of paranoid manager Denny, Arbie is thrust into the monotony of minimum wage with a variety of colorful co-workers: the effeminate Mexican Paco Bell (Khalid Rivera), the [[Bestiality|animal-loving]] [[redneck]] Carl Jr. (Caleb Emerson), the [[burqa]]-clad [[Muslim]] Hummus (Rose Ghavami) and a mysterious 60-year-old man in the restaurant's basement who has worked as the restaurant's costumed [[mascot]] all his life and has a virtually identical background to Arbie.

However, strange things are afoot at the American Chicken Bunker. While grinding meat, Paco is pushed into the meat grinder by an uncooked chicken. General Lee Roy decides not to do anything, and lets Paco get turned into sloppy jose. Arbie begins to unravel a sinister plot involving the spirits of disenfranchised [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and the billions of slaughtered chickens sent to the "concentration [[chicken coop|coops]]" who plan on exacting their revenge in the most gruesome ways possible, after being told so by Paco (who is reanimated as a sloppy jose). Carl Jr, who is having [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] with an uncooked chicken in the storage room, fights the uncooked chicken when it starts biting his penis. Hummus manages to kill the uncooked chicken by shoving a broom up Carl's backside, though it tears off his penis. General Lee Roy tells them not to take him to a hospital.  He instead tells them to give the chicken (which has been sprayed with blood and green ichor) to the protester outside. Carl Jr. is killed when Arbie gives him alcohol to drink. After Mickie tells the protesters that the chicken tastes good, the protesters go inside the restaurant to eat chicken. Wendy finds out that Mickie has been paid by General Lee Roy to say that the chicken tastes good; she breaks up with Mickie and returns to Arbie. General Lee Roy gets diarrhea after being force-fed eating a piece of chicken. General Lee Roy lays an egg in the bathroom and is attacked by the chicken that hatches from the egg. He rips off the chicken's head with his teeth and is sprayed with green blood.  He becomes a giant egg and hatches into a chicken zombie. He then decapitates Denny (who is telling a story about the first time he encountered a chicken).

The customers, workers, and protesters then all turn into zombie chickens. The mascot (Lloyd Kaufman) shoots all the chicken zombies inside with an M-16 machine gun.  The General Lee Roy zombie returns, but is shot down by the mascot.  As the old man approaches the General, he gets his nose ripped off by a now zombie chicken Denny. Arbie then shoots and kills Denny. Wendy turns the open/closed sign to "closed", which keeps the chicken zombies at bay. The mascot, who is still alive, tells Arbie that he is his future self. He then turns into a chicken zombie. Mickie, who attempts to escape, is turned into a zombie chicken. She and the Mascot chicken zombie chase after Arbie and Wendy. Hummus drinks meat steroid in an attempt to save them and accidentally kills herself in the process. Arbie and Wendy realize that beer kills the chicken zombies and then kill the Mickie and mascot zombie. They run out of beer and are saved by Hummus (who is still alive, despite having exploded a few minutes earlier). They find a child hiding in the storage room and are attacked once again by the General Lee Roy chicken. It is then killed by the Paco sandwich. Hummus is then shown to have C-4 strapped to her body and tells them that she will sacrifice herself. Wendy, Arbie, and the little girl escape as the building explodes. While being driven home in a car, the child experiences stomach cramps after drinking a can of beer and eventually starts clucking like a chicken thus laying an egg, frightening her, Arbie, and Wendy. The guys eventually lose control and crash, resulting in the car back-flipping before landing on the ground and exploding, thus killing all inside.

In a post-credits scene, the zombified chickens are shown dancing as a reprise of the ''Poultrygeist'' theme song plays.

==Production==
Taking six years from script to screen, ''Poultrygeist'' was officially released on [[DVD]] in 2008 following a limited theatrical run.<ref name="Rotten">{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/poultrygeist/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=''Poultrygeist'' on Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Motion">{{Cite video |author=Deemer, Andy |author2= Walker, Kiel  |title=''Poultry in Motion: Truth is Stranger than Chicken'' |medium=[[Making-of]] [[documentary film]] |publisher=[[Troma Entertainment]] |location=''Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead'' DVD |date=2005–2008}}</ref>

''Poultrygeist'' first began as a [[spec script]] of the same title submitted to Troma Entertainment by Daniel Bova around 2002. After a number of re-writes at the hands of several Troma employees, the script reached a final draft in 2004, completed by long-time Troma [[Editing|editor]] Gabriel Friedman. Then given the title ''Poultrygeist: Attack of the Chicken Zombies'', Troma heavily promoted the film in the mid-2000s in an attempt to gain funding, though ultimately failed to secure adequate financing.
[[File:PoultryBTS.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The crew of ''Poultrygeist'' stands before the "American Chicken Bunker". Director [[Lloyd Kaufman]] is on the far left.]]

The budget for ''Poultrygeist'' was roughly around $500,000, a typical budget for a Troma film. A large part of the film's financing came out-of-pocket from [[Lloyd Kaufman]] and [[Michael Herz (producer)|Michael Herz]], while Kaufman and his wife, [[Pat Swinney Kaufman|Patricia Swinney Kaufman]], dipped into their personal retirement savings to help fund the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/interview/449 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204653/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/interview/449 |title=Poultrygeist: Director/Troma Founder Lloyd Kaufman |last=Harley |first=David |publisher=[[Bloody-Disgusting.com]] |year=2008 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |accessdate=February 2, 2015}}</ref>

Much of ''Poultrygeist''{{'}}s crew was made up entirely of [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who had answered advertisements posted by Troma on such websites as [[Craigslist]] and horror-based [[internet forum|message boards]] looking for available crew members. According to ''[[Fangoria]]'', hundreds of people applied, and volunteers traveled from as far as [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]] and numerous parts of the United States to work on the film, serving in various crew positions or as [[production assistant]]s.<ref name="Fango">{{cite journal |publisher=''[[Fangoria]]'' |date=May 2007 |issue=283 |title=Murder Most Fowl |author=Colby, Christine}}</ref> Duggie Banas, who [[composer|composed]] the movie's musical numbers, became attached to the film after answering an online ad looking for composers who'd be willing to work on a film for free.<ref name="Comm">Lloyd Kaufman & Gabriel Friedman. ''Poultrygeist'' DVD audio commentary.</ref> Many of the props and masks featured in the film were donations from special effects studios from around the world.<ref name="Fango" />

Shot on [[35 mm film]] by long-time Troma cinematographer Brendan C. Flynt, [[principal photography]] for ''Poultrygeist'' took place during the summer of 2005 at an abandoned [[McDonald's]] in the Bailey-Kensington neighborhood of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Over 80 crew members and 300 unpaid extras worked on the film.<ref name="Fango" /> A nearby abandoned church was rented out by Troma, where over 70 cast and crew members resided for the duration of the shoot, despite only housing one working bathroom.<ref name="Motion" />

As chronicled in ''Poultrygeist''{{'}}s [[making-of]] [[documentary]] ''Poultry in Motion: Truth Is Stranger Than Chicken'', the production was plagued with numerous problems, including malfunctioning special effects, delayed and over-scheduled filming, pay disputes with the actors and even the restaurant set being prematurely deconstructed on the last day of shooting.<ref name="Motion" /> Despite the production hardships, ''Poultrygeist'' managed to successfully complete its principal photography by August 2005.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37586/watch-tromas-poultrygeist-online-now-free Watch Troma's Poultrygeist Online Now for Free!]</ref>

==Release and reception==

===Promotion===
[[File:ColonelKluck.jpg|left|250px|thumb|"Colonel Kluck" protests on behalf of ''Poultrygeist'' at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].]]
Press coverage of ''Poultrygeist'' began even in the earliest stages of the film's production. British publication [[Hotdog Magazine]] covered the film in 2005 while filming was still in progress,<ref>{{cite journal |publisher=''[[Hotdog Magazine]]'' |author=Barter, Pavel |date=October 2005 |title=Fowl Play}}</ref> while [[Ain't It Cool News]], ''[[Attack of the Show]]'' and ''[[Fangoria]]'' reported on the film throughout the stages of its post-production, with the latter giving ''Poultrygeist'' a full four-page feature in mid-2007.<ref name="Fango" />

''Poultrygeist'' received some media attention when Troma picketed the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] held at [[Manhattan]]{{'}}s [[Village East Cinema]], where ''Poultrygeist''{{'}}s premiere was to be held the following month. Tribeca, who was renting out the venue for the festival, forced the theater to stop playing the film's trailers and remove its posters. In response, a number of Troma employees, including one in a chicken costume, stood outside the Village East Cinema during the days of the festival, brandishing posters, sandwich boards and giveaways in promotion of the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/item_AtyAzOM3XAIV4fGxeXMvYM |title=Clucking Picket |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |date=May 6, 2008}}</ref>

===Theatrical release===

''Poultrygeist'' grossed $22,623.<ref>http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=poultrygeist.htm</ref> The film made its first [[Film premiere|premiere]] at the [[Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film]] on April 14, 2007, and spent the remainder of 2007 playing international engagements in [[Amsterdam]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Spain]], and film festivals including the [[Toronto After Dark Film Festival]], the [[Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival]] and the [[Calgary International Film Festival]]. The film began playing throughout the United States in early 2008, making its official cast and crew-attended premiere in [[New York City]] on May 9, 2008.

''Poultrygeist'' played in New York through July 3, followed by two-week long run at the [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle Sunset]] in [[Los Angeles]] on June 14.

The film continued to make sporadic theatrical engagements throughout the United States up to and even after its official DVD release. On April 17, 2009, ''Poultrygeist'' had a wide release in the Midwest, opening simultaneously in 11 theaters in eight states, including two screens each in [[Wisconsin]] and [[Indiana]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poultrygeistmovie.com/news/2009/04/16/poultrygesit-clucks-into-theaters-all-over-the-midwest-starting-april-17th/ |title=Poultrygeist Clucks Into Theaters All Over The Midwest Starting April 17th |publisher=www.poultrygeistmovie.com |date=April 16, 2009}}</ref>

===Critical response===
The film has a certified "fresh" rating of 64% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the general critical consensus being that it "may be relentlessly tasteless and juvenile, but it's also a lively slice of schlocky fun".<ref name="Rotten" />

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the film a B+ rating, calling it "an exploitation movie with soul" and noting "it's genuine sick fun, and there isn't a boring moment in it".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20202024,00.html |title=Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead review |author=Gleiberman, Owen |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |date=May 22, 2008}}</ref> Nathan Lee of ''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke of the film as being "as perfect as a film predicated on the joys of [[Gastric outlet obstruction|projectile vomiting]] and explosive [[diarrhea]] can be", describing it as "liberating" in a "lowbrow way".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/movies/09poul.html |title=Movie Review – Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead |date=May 9, 2008 |author=Lee, Nathan |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}</ref>

On the negative end of the critical spectrum, Roger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' felt the film "wears out its joke, like all Troma films, long before that last 50-gallon keg of fake blood is tapped...it's a 40-minute short struggling to escape a 103-minute feature", giving it a rating of two out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-db-moviereviews-searchresults,0,3279701,results.formprofile?turbine_cdb_lib__cdb_01_txt=Poultrygeist:%20Night%20of%20the%20Chicken%20Dead&Find+it!=Submit+Query |publisher=''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' |author=Moore, Roger |date=February 22, 2008 |title=Movie Review: Poultrygeist}}</ref> ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'' gave the film two out of six stars, claiming its "half-funny" "trashiness" only appeals to horror fans, while ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' was considerably harsher, rating the film half a star out of four, calling it "superficially turgid" and that its "strangely impressive originality doesn't even close to compensating for its everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink midnight-movie awfulness".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/chicago/reviews/85488/poultrygeist-night-of-the-chicken-dead.html |publisher=''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]'' |author=Rothkopf, Joshua |date=May 2008 |title=Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead Movie Review}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/poultrygeist-night-of-the-chicken-dead/3565 |publisher=''[[Slant Magazine]]'' |date=May 6, 2008 |author=Humanick, Rob |title=Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead review}}</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'', however, while criticizing the film's poor taste, acting and pacing, described the satire as "wicked" and predicted that its flaws would not stop it from becoming an "underground cult hit".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/item_A7ZwLE9mjVEupCUah6qZTO;jsessionid=C752B4CC92A2ABEC9C5D689F059C1515 |publisher=''[[New York Post]]'' |date=May 9, 2008 |title=Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead |author=Smith, Kyle}}</ref>

==Connections with previous Troma films==
In contrast to Kaufman's previous films, ''[[Terror Firmer]]'' and ''[[Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV]]'', which heavily referenced and relied on the audience's familiarity of Troma films, ''Poultrygeist'' is only loosely connected with the "Tromaverse" yet makes numerous background references to their previous films. Arbie can be seen wearing an "I Love the Monster Hero" shirt from ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]'' in an early scene, posters of ''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[When Nature Calls]]'' adorn the walls of Wendy's bedroom, and DVD copies of ''[[Tales from the Crapper]]'' can be seen stuffed in a dumpster. Most notably, ''Poultrygeist'' features the infamous car flip stunt that was originally filmed in 1991 for ''[[Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.]]'' and has been recycled for comic effect in every Kaufman-directed film since.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Poultrygeist (soundtrack)}}
The [[soundtrack album]] for ''Poultrygeist'' was released on October 3, 2006, through Troma Entertainment, featuring the film's musical segments composed by Duggie Banas, snippets of film dialogue and a selection of [[punk rock]] songs from bands including [[The Dwarves]], [[Zombina and the Skeletones]], [[Scatterbox]] and [[Potshot (band)|Potshot]]. All copies of the soundtrack came with a bonus DVD featuring numerous special features including trailers and the first five minutes of the movie.

==DVD release==
''Poultrygeist'' received its [[DVD]] release on October 28, 2008, in an "Eggs-clusive 3-Disc Collector's Edition", which featured the following bonus material:
* ''Poultry in Motion: Truth is Stranger than Chicken'' – a feature-length (82 minutes) behind-the-scenes documentary on the production of ''Poultrygeist'', directed by the film's producer Andy Deemer and [[line producer]] Jason Foulke.
* [[Deleted scene]]s, including an [[alternate ending]] with [[Ron Jeremy]].
* Audio commentary from Lloyd Kaufman and Gabriel Friedman.
* Footage of ''Poultrygeist'''s NYC premiere.
* Seven behind-the-scenes featurettes, including "Recording the Songs", "Designing the Monsters", "Filming the Meat Grinder" and "Joe Fleishaker Gets a Head Mold".

The third disc was a "Kara-Yolk-E" supplement, featuring all of the film's musical numbers with an optional [[karaoke]] track added on.

On March 31, 2009, a two-disc "Special Egg-Dition" was released, omitting the karaoke disc. On February 23, 2010, the film was issued on [[Blu-ray disc|Blu-ray]].

==DVD switch controversy==
''Poultrygeist'' made national news on January 7, 2011, when Sidney Klawitter from [[Orland, California]], purchased a DVD cleaning kit from a local retailer, only to later discover the cleaner disc was a disguised copy of the film ''Poultrygeist''. Klawitter was deeply offended by the film's content, noting "it was horrifying", calling it "a [[X rating|Triple-X rated]] movie".  According to the owner of the store the cleaner kit was purchased from, the item had come pre-packaged from a warehouse distributor in [[Oakland, California]]. No charges were filed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krcrtv.com/news/26407819/detail.html |title=Customer Shocked To Discover X-Rated Movie On His DVD Cleaning Disc |author=Saam, Kelli |publisher=[[KRCR-TV]] |date=January 7, 2011}}</ref>
