'''''REC 2''''' (stylized as '''''[•REC]²''''') is a 2009 [[Spanish cinema|Spanish]] [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[horror film]] sequel to 2007's ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'' and the second installment of the REC film series. The film was written and directed by [[Jaume Balagueró]] and [[Paco Plaza]], both of whom returned from the previous film. The story takes place immediately after the events of the first film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update: Behind-the-Scenes of ''Rec 2''|work=ShockTillYouDrop.com|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=9537|date=8 February 2009|accessdate=16 February 2009}}</ref>

Several actors from the first film reprise their roles, mostly briefly appearing as infected versions of their characters. The film was followed by ''[[REC 3: Genesis]]''.

==Plot==
Dr. Owen ([[Jonathan D. Mellor|Jonathan Mellor]]), an official from the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health]], and a heavily armed [[Grupo Especial de Operaciones|GEO]] team equipped with video cameras are sent into a quarantined apartment building to control the situation. After Martos, a GEO operator, is killed and infected while encountering some of the infected, Owen uses religious mantra and [[rosary]] to hold him off in a room. It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], the same attacker from the end of the previous film.

At the penthouse, Tristana is nowhere to be found. Larra, one of the GEO operators, finds a sample of her (Tristana's) blood – the only one that the original priest took from her. Owen performs a religious rite, and the blood combusts, confirming that it is the blood he is looking for; however, Fernandez, commanding officer of the GEO team drops it, rendering it useless. Owen tells them that they must get a blood sample from Tristana herself.

Jennifer's father, who was outside getting medicine for his daughter (the infected Jennifer from the first installment), manages to convince a firefighter to take him into the building. Three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori gain access to the building through the sewage system; however, police seal their exit. After the deaths of Larra, Jennifer's father, and the firefighter from attacks by the possessed, the two groups find each other. However, Tito has been bitten, and they restrain him and lock Mire and Ori in a room where their fates are left unknown. The group then finds Ángela Vidal ([[Manuela Velasco]]), the reporter from ''[[REC (film) | REC]]'', who still has her camera with her. Owen forces Tito to tell him where Tristana Medeiros is. The demon possessing Tito tells him that she is "in the highest." Owen figures out that this means that she is in the penthouse. The demon then gives a hint that the "light" blinds them from seeing the path. When Ángela is asked how she saw Tristana, she says she saw her through the camera's night vision. Owen deduces that some things can only be seen in the dark.

They go back to the penthouse. When they turn on the camera's night vision, a door appears that leads them to a room. They find a tub filled with water that cannot be seen when the lights are on. While the GEO chief, Fernandez investigates it, Tristana leaps out and drags him in and then disappears as the light is turned on. When Tristana attacks them again, Ángela blows her head off with a shotgun, finally killing her. Owen is enraged because he needed the blood sample, but all Ángela wants to do is leave the building. At this point, the only survivors are Ángela, Owen, and Rosso, the GEO cameraman. When Owen refuses to authorize their exit, Ángela starts to beat him. Rosso tells her to stop, but she shoots and kills him. It is revealed that the demon possessing Tristana has now possessed Ángela so she can leave the building. After telling Owen that she does not need him to get out, as she can impersonate his voice, she kills him. She takes his radio and says that the mission is over and they can let them out. She also tells them that he is staying behind because he is infected and the only survivor is a woman, Ángela. When asked how the woman survived, the demonic Ángela looks at the camera and smiles.

The ending of the first film is shown, but extended to reveal how the demon possessed Ángela (by forcing her mouth open and transferring some type of large parasite into her mouth), and then as Ángela, went into hiding as Owen and the GEO team broke into the penthouse earlier in the film.
