== History ==
The feature film ''From Parts Unknown: Fight like a Girl'' began in late 2006 and was in the final stages of post-production in late 2014. The inspiration for the film comes from Daniel Armstrong’s work in the video game industry. The combination of characters from his day job with the concept of a wrestling action video game gone wrong ultimately led to the film.

On 6 October 2006 the film went into production with less than $5,000, no director of photography, no editor, no composer, no sound designer, and no access to a post-production facility.

The project was temporarily shelved for lack of resources. The success of Armstrong's other work, ''[[MurderDrome]]'' gave ''From Parts Unknown'' funded a restart for the project.
