'''''4bia''''' or ''Phobia'' ({{lang-th|สี่แพร่ง}}; {{RTGS|Si Phraeng}}; literally "Crossroads") is a 2008 [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] [[horror film]] in four parts, directed by [[Youngyooth Thongkonthun]], [[Banjong Pisanthanakun]], [[Parkpoom Wongpoom]], and [[Paween Purijitpanya]].

== Plot==
;''Loneliness'' (Thai title - เหงา, ''Ngao''; directed by Youngyooth Thongkonthun)
Pin, a young woman stuck in her apartment due to the cast on her leg, communicates with the outside world via cell phone and text messages. She complains to her boyfriend, Puak, who went on a camping trip in [[Chiang Mai Province|Chiang Mai]], that she feels so lonely. Every night, Pin exchanges text messages with a stranger, who asks to befriend her and seems friendly enough. The stranger says that he is in somewhere "cramped" for 100 days and is oddly only able to be contacted at night. After sending the mysterious stranger her photo, Pin asks for one in return and is sent the same photo. When she questions him, he says he is in the picture next to her. A ghostly face is slightly visible next to Pin's smiling face. As she researches recent deaths, Pin discovers that the son of Princess Sophia of Virnistan died and was buried with a cellphone so he can communicate with Princess Sophia—his mother, or to connect to someone else whenever he feels lonely. Pin then gets a text from the stranger, saying that he will come to her place now. All of the lights begin to go out and Pin cries in fear. She is then assaulted by the ghost and is thrown out of the window to her death. A scene from the past shows the prince receiving a text message from his girlfriend ending the relationship which makes him walk in front of a taxi cab causing an accident, the same accident that was the cause of Pin's broken leg as she was inside the cab.

;''Deadly Charm'' (Thai title - ยันต์สั่งตาย, ''Yan Sang Tai''; directed by Paween Purikitpanya)
A nerdy student named Ngid sees his school friends take some drugs, and he is beaten to death. One of the gang's member, Pink, is worried but fails to stop her friends from bullying Ngid. Unfortunately, when he is beaten, he curses his friends on a deadly charm, which requires a photo of a person died with his/her eyes open. Things get worse when everything keeps moving by itself when ordered by Ngid's soul, and one by one the drug addicts start dying. Even though Pink did not beat him, Ngid's soul decides not to spare her too because she had seen it all yet had not do anything to help him. In the end, a police officer comes by to warn her not to go outside, and is shocked to see Pink laughing after having gouged her own eyes; because the curse requires the victim to see Ngid, he cannot harm her anymore now that she has gotten rid of her ability to see. It is revealed that the person in the photo Ngid used to practice the charm is Pin, the disabled young woman in the first story who died with her eyes open.

;''The Man In The Middle'' (Thai title - คนกลาง, ''Khon Klang; directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun)
Four rafting-lovers, Aey, Ter, Shin, and Phuak are rafting in a lonely jungle in Chiang Mai. At night in the camp, Aey tells his friends that if he dies, the person who sleep in the middle will be the next to die with him. The next day, when they are swimming in the river, Aey drowns and cannot be located. The rest are scared, but decide to stay and fight over who gets to sleep in the middle (they are frightened by Aey's story). That night, Aey comes back, but strange events happening afterwards make his friends suspicious. Shin then finds Aey's body. Frightened, they go running in the woods but are shocked to find their own dead bodies. It is revealed that all of them had died when the raft crumpled over, but only Aey accepted his death, while the rest continued to ignore the fact that they had died. At the end, the four become ghosts together.

;''Flight 244'' (Thai title - เที่ยวบิน 224, ''Thiao Bin 244''; directed by Parkpoom Wongpoon)
Flight attendant Pim is secretly having an affair with Prince Albert of Virnistan. One day she is ordered to go aboard an airliner on a charter flight for Princess Sophia, the wife of the Prince. Her fellow stewardess, Tui, is unable to attend the flight as her brother Ter had been found drowned in Chiang Mai. What was supposed to be an ordinary flight turns into something tragic when the princess forms an allergic reaction to Pim's lunch as it contains shrimp to which the princess is allergic to. After the royal house of Virnistan requests that her corpse be sent back immediately for cremation, Pim is required to remain on the plane and escort the body - the only passenger - for the return flight. As the Princess tries to get out of her shroud, Pim's worst nightmare begins. When the plane lands, Pim's body is found lying on the floor, under the feet of the intact enshrouded corpse of Princess Sophia.
