'''''Kristy''''' is a 2014 [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Olly Blackburn|Oliver Blackburn]] and starring [[Haley Bennett]] and [[Ashley Greene]]. The plot follows a college student who stays on campus alone over [[Thanksgiving]] break and finds herself terrorized by a [[cult]] of [[ritual killing|ritual killers]]. The film premiered at the [[London Film Festival]] and also had theatrical releases internationally. In the United States, the film debuted on the [[Lifetime Network]] in October 2015, and was released on [[Netflix]] on November 5, 2015.

==Plot==
The film opens with a hooded figure photographing a young woman's corpse in an empty field, followed by a montage of internet screenshots and video of women being killed in what appears to be [[ritual murder]]s by a [[cybersectarianism|cybercult]], and footage of the murders being uploaded on an anonymous underground website, where members are encouraged to "kill Kristy," "Kristy" coming from a Latin name meaning "follower of God."

College student Justine is attending a private university in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] on scholarship and financial aid, and is unable to afford to fly home for the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday. Her boyfriend Aaron and wealthy roommate Nicole both leave for the holiday, leaving Justine to spend the holiday in solitude on a nearly empty campus, aside from the security guard, Wayne, and groundskeeper, Scott. 

On Thanksgiving night, Justine uses Nicole's [[BMW]] to drive to a nearby convenience store off campus. Inside the store, a hooded girl, Violet, approaches Justine, complimenting her car. At the counter, the girl asks for a student discount on a pair of sunglasses, but has no ID. Justine offers to pay for them, but the girl refuses and calls her "Kristy." On the drive home, Justine nearly rear ends a mysterious car parked in the middle of the road. Upon returning to the campus, Justine calls Aaron and informs him of the strange occurrence, and though he offers to come stay the night with her, she declines. After falling asleep on a couch in the common room, she hears odd noises coming from the direction of her dorm. Inside her dorm, Justine finds that someone has accessed her laptop, as a [[snuff film]] plays on the screen. Violet appears in the room with a boxcutter in hand, and Justine flees to the entryway. Outside, Wayne, who had been investigating a noise, is murdered in front of her by a masked man.

The four cult killers assemble, and Violet begins recording Justine, telling her that they will hunt her, and that she should "run to God." Justine flees to Scott's house on the edge of the campus for help. Scott goes outside to confront the assailants, but the killers murder his dog before [[hanging]] him from a swingset in the yard. Justine attempts to call 911 from Scott's cellphone, but the gang has [[hacker (computer security)|hacked]] into it. They begin sending Justine video clips of herself on the phone and menacing text messages. Justine attempts to hide in the library, but is chased to the roof of the building; cornered by the four assailants, she leaps from the roof, falling through the branches of a tree help break her fall. 

Aaron arrives at the campus, and Justine struggles to run toward his car, but he is killed by one of the men in front of her. She uses Aaron's car to pin the man against a concrete wall, crushing him to death. She then retreats to the gymnasium where she hides in the swimming pool. She stabs one of the men in the throat with her car keys before drowning him, and beats the other man to death with a baseball bat inside the locker room. She hears a cell phone alert from the dead man's jacket, and reads a text message from Violet asking if he's "killed Kristy yet." Justine responds "yes." While accessing the killer's phone, Justine finds photos of the cult's numerous victims, and their declaration to kill the "Kristys" of the world—pure, beautiful, and privileged women who they believe follow God.

Justine uses pool chemicals from a storage closet to create a flammable powder. She then dresses herself in the dead man's mask and jacket, and approaches the car where Violet is, dousing it in the powder. Violet attempts to lash at her with a box cutter, but Justine ignites the powder, and Violet is engulfed in flames; Justine watches as she is burned alive. She then photographs Violet's corpse with the cell phone, and uploads it to the website, entitled ''/the fold/''.  A montage at the end of the film narrated by news footage reveals a series of similar cult murders had occurred in [[New York City]]; [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]; [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]; [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], but with Justine's testimony and access to the phone, many of the cult's members have been arrested. A [[post-credits scene]] shows a young woman being attacked by another cult killer outside her home.
