==Plot==
Bret Fitzpatrick (Joe Ciminera) is a New York real-estate developer who values his business and money over the well-being of his family and friends. Bret has had a difficult childhood and all the success he has had in his life makes him want more.
 
Soon Bret has to travel back to his home town to evict Mrs. Keller (Natalie Swan) his tenant due to late rent payments. Bret arrives at Mrs. Keller's rented house and gives her 12 days time to vacate the house. Mrs. Keller agrees to vacate the premises but requests for longer time but Bret does not agree. As he leaves the premises, he is distracted by a call and nearly gets hit by a car after walking into its path.

After this, Bret starts seeing dead people. He sees his dead sister and goes to a [[priest]] to consult him. The rest of the movie is about Bret coming to terms with his imminent death.
