==Release==
In March 2015 the [[British Board of Film Classification]] refused to issue a classification certificate for a [[video-on-demand]] release due to scenes of strong violence (including sexualized violence) incited by drug abuse and racial hatred. The film had not been previously submitted for either a theatrical or a home video certificate, and so it cannot be legally supplied to anyone within the UK.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheatly|first1=Phil|title=UK ‘Hate Crime’ ban – James Cullen Bressack responds|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/03/09/uk-hate-crime-ban-james-cullen-bressack-responds/|website=Nerdly|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> Director Bressack stated that he was "honored" by the fact that his "mind is officially too twisted for the UK".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=James Cullen Bressack’s ‘Hate Crime’ banned by the BBFC|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2015/03/02/james-cullen-bressacks-hate-crime-banned-by-the-bbfc/|website=Nerdly|accessdate=2 June 2017|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref>
