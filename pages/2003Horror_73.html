'''''Octane''''' (released as '''''Pulse''''' in the United States) is a 2003 British-Luxembourg [[horror film]] directed by [[Marcus Adams (director)|Marcus Adams]] and starring [[Madeleine Stowe]], [[Mischa Barton]], and [[Norman Reedus]]. The film follows a divorced mother and her teenage daughter on a late-night [[road trip]], and the mother's battle to find her daughter after she gets caught up with a bizarre [[cult]] of young criminals at a [[truck stop]]. 

Shot largely in [[Luxembourg]], the film features a soundtrack by dance duo [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]]. It was released in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2003, having previously screened at the [[CineVegas|CineVegas Film Festival]] in the United States. Upon its release, the film was noted by some critics (such as ''Variety'') for blending elements of American [[road movie|road film]]s with surrealist horror.<ref name=foundas/>

==Plot==
A man and woman posing as paramedics assists a man in an overturned car on a freeway. As an ambulance approaches, the woman panics, taping the man's mouth shut and pulling him rom the car before speeding away. Meanwhile, single mother Senga and her 15-year-old daughter Natasha 'Nat' are on a six-hour overnight drive home, following a visit to Marek, Nat's father, for her birthday. En route, they pass by the crash, and Senga notices a strange man and woman photographing the scene; as Senga watches them, the man turns his camera and photographs her. 

Unnerved and exhausted, Senga nearly falls asleep while driving, and decides to stop at a [[truck stop]] diner. Outside, Nat meets a young female backpacker and offers her a ride. Senga is visibly disturbed by the backpacker and the strange [[ambient music|ambient]] CD she plays in the car. They drop her at a picnic area and when they return seconds later to return the CD she left behind, she seems to have disappeared. Shortly after, Nat convinces her mother to return to the diner, so that she can get her birthday present from her father. Already stressed from the long drive, Senga is furious when she discovers that Marek has bought Nat tickets to a concert that she has refused to allow her to attend. After a heated argument, Nat gets into an [[RV]] with the backpacker and a strange couple.

Senga solicits the assistance of a police officer, but when she seems unhelpful, goes after the RV herself, tailing the officer who had just left the diner. The police officer meets up with the inhabitants of the RV. Senga breaks into their RV and discovers a number of strange things, including thermoses full of blood and videos of young girls talking about their past lives. She escapes the RV before anyone returns, but once back on the road, The Backpacker reveals herself to be hiding in the backseat. She strangles Senga, causing her to crash.

In the back of an oil tanker, Nat parties with the Backpacker and a young man, who tell her about their group and their enigmatic leader. Senga is woken by the recovery man, a disturbed drifter who cruises highways in his tow truck, who insists that Senga come with him. In his car, she finds a picture of a girl she saw in a video in the RV. The recovery man informs Senga that the girl is Christine, his dead sister. Senga is taken to a police station, where she reports Nat's disappearance. The police are less than helpful, and, in frustration, she asks them to call Marek. The man who answers Marek's phone tells the police that Senga is on medication, and that Nat has been with him all weekend.

Back at the truck stop, Senga sees the man and woman she had seen earlier photographing the car accident. As her paranoia mounts, she suspects them to be involved with Nat's disappearance, and attacks the woman, resulting in her being kicked out of the diner. While hiding in a hallway, she encounters the woman with two male cult members, and flees outside. As they leave the truck stop, the recovery man follows them in his truck; Senga follows behind, ending up at an abandoned research facility.

While Nat meets the Father, the recovery man detonates a bomb, killing several of the cult members. Before the Father can initiate Nat, Senga attacks him. Mother and daughter flee in different directions, with Senga being pursued by the backpacker and Nat being placated by the Father, who uses a loudspeaker to talk to her. During the fight, the Father reveals that Senga wanted to have an [[abortion]] when she discovered she was pregnant with Nat. The shock of this revelation leaves Senga in a near [[catatonic]] state.

The recovery man pulls her out of her stupor by showing her Marek's body. Senga uses this information to try to demonstrate to Nat how evil her new friends are. While mother and daughter try to escape, the recovery man and the Father wrestle; when the Father bites the recovery man's tongue and spits it out, Senga detonates his last bomb, killing them both. Senga and Nat leave, continuing their drive home in daylight. When they stop at a gas station, they return to their car to find a razor blade &mdash; the Father's calling card &mdash; attached to the rear view mirror.

==Production==
Director Marcus Adams recalled producers Alistair MacLean-Clark and Basil Stephens approaching him to direct the film in 2001, which at that time was "essentially a [[vampire]] movie," which had been in development for around five years.<ref name=cast>{{cite av media|title=Cast and Crew Interviews|people=Adams, Marcus; Stowe, Madeleine [[et al.]]|work=Octane|format=DVD|medium=Documentary|publisher=First Look Home Video}}</ref> Adams spent one year rewriting elements of the script with screenwriter [[Stephen Volk]]; this included altering the ending as well as subduing the overt vampire plot of the film, resulting in what Adams envisioned as  "faint" vampire film, where vampires functioned more as a metaphor than as literal beings.<ref name=cast/>

===Critical reception===
According to the internet [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 17% approval rating based on reviews from 6 critics.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pulse2004/|accessdate=20 February 2018|title=Octane (Pulse)}}</ref> Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted: "Even were the performers not so disinterested, Volk’s screenplay not so hopelessly didactic about its “message” and the Luxeumbourg setting not so suggestive of tax-credit incentives run amok, it might be hard to watch ''Octane'' with a straight face...[its] murky, frequently under-lit widescreen lensing and comatose cutting are the perfect complements to pic’s overall dreariness."<ref name=foundas>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Octane|date=25 June 2003|accessdate=23 December 2017|url=https://variety.com/2003/film/reviews/octane-1200540837/|author=Foundas, Scott}}</ref> Adam Keen of ''[[Film Review (magazine)|Film Review]]'' awarded the film three stars out of four, noting: "''Octane'' is a thriller that fits loosely in a genre occupied by ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', ''[[Road Kill (1999 film)|Roadkill]]'' and ''[[Jeepers Creepers (2001 film)|Jeepers Creepers]]'', is a suspenseful, visceral feast that preys on our worst fears of the open road."<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Film Review (magazine)|Film Review]] (2004–2005): The Definitive Film Yearbook|author=Keen, Adam|year=2004|publisher=Reynolds & Hearn|at=n.p.|editor=Cameron-Wilson, James|isbn=978-1-903-11187-1}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film one out of five stars, calling it an "incoherent horror flick."<ref>{{cite journal|work=[[TV Guide]]|title=Octane ('03)|publisher=Triangle Publications|year=2005|volume=53|issn=0039-8543}}</ref>

[Director] Adams seems reluctant to simply tell the story and gets muddled in an onslaught of [[David Lynch|Lynchian]] [[surrealism]]. Unlike Lynch, though, the weirdness is neither imaginative nor elegant enough to spark interest in what it actually means, and the third act - with Jonathan Rhys-Meyers as another effete weirdo - is not only dull, but also utterly baffling."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=11 October 2015|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/octane/review/|title=Octane Review|author=Thomas, William|accessdate=23 December 2017}} {{rating|2|5}}</ref> Mike Goodridge of ''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' wrote of the film: "Adams has a confident visual style, effectively capturing Senga's moments of dozy consciousness before nodding off. Indeed her half-awake, half-asleep state could have been used to more dramatic effect to heighten the ambiguity of the plot a la ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' or ''[[Suspicion (1941 film)|Suspicion]]''. Nevertheless, Stowe's strident and underused screen presence makes it eminently watchable and helps lift ''Octane'' out of the ordinary."<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]|author=Goodridge, Mike|accessdate=20 February 2018|url=https://www.screendaily.com/octane/4013912.article|date=17 June 2003|title=Octane}}</ref>
