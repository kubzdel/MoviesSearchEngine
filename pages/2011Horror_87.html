==Plot==
'Inʞubus' tells the story of a [[skeleton crew]] working the final shift at a soon-to-be demolished police station in Wood Haven, [[Rhode Island]]. The night takes a gruesome turn when the [[demon]], Inkubus ([[Robert Englund]]), calmly walks into the station holding the severed head of a murdered girl.  Inkubus toys with the crew, allowing himself to be restrained, and begins to proudly confess to his litany of crimes, some dating back to the Middle Ages. Inkubus has a score to settle with the one detective ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]) that almost put him away some thirteen years ago.  To their dismay, the cops quickly become pawns in Inkubus’ brutal crowning achievement of [[murder]], gore, and [[mayhem (crime)|mayhem]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Janusonis |first=Michael |url=http://www.projo.com/movies/content/lb_englund_on_movie_set_05-15-10_3QIFF9C_v18.1d8788e.html |title=New nightmare: Robert Englund gets scary again with filmmaker Michael Corrente |work=The Providence Journal |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041415/http://www.projo.com/movies/content/lb_englund_on_movie_set_05-15-10_3QIFF9C_v18.1d8788e.html |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>
