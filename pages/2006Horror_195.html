'''''Taxidermia''''' is a 2006 [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[comedy-drama]] [[horror film]] directed by [[György Pálfi]]. An [[co-production (media)|international co-production]] of Hungary, Austria and France, the film is a [[metaphor]]ical socio-political retelling of Hungary's history from the Second World War to the present day.<ref name="test">{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410730/board/nest/155009133 |title=www.imdb.com |accessdate=2012-01-07|work=forum discussion}}</ref>

The story is told by means of three generations of men from Hungary, beginning with a military orderly during the [[World War II|Second World War]], moving on to an aspiring speed-eater during the [[Cold War]], and concluding with a taxidermist during contemporary times. The film contains elements of [[dark comedy]] and [[body horror]].

==Plot==
At a remote Hungarian military outpost, orderly Morosgoványi Vendel lives a wretched existence of servitude beneath the heel of his lieutenant, Öreg Balatony Kálmán. Condemned to performing menial duties for the officer and his family while sleeping in an unheated shack next to the latrines, Morosgoványi frequently escapes into fantasy. So realistic are these fantasies that in one ambiguous instance, Morosgoványi sleeps with and impregnates the lieutenant's wife and "wakes up" to find himself engaged in an act of [[sodomy]] with a slaughtered pig. Upon seeing this, the lieutenant promptly executes Morosgoványi and raises the son, Balatony Kálmán, as his own.

Decades later, Kálmán has grown into a champion Hungarian [[competitive eating|speed-eater]]. Coached and influenced by the strict Jenő, Kálmán's life revolves around training for the eventual day when the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] recognizes speed-eating as a legitimate sport. After a bout of [[trismus|lockjaw]] at a Soviet event and eloping with fellow speed-eating champion Aczél Gizi, Kálmán resumes his rigorous training, even as Gizi gives birth to their son, Balatony Lajoska.

Some years later, Lajoska has grown into a dedicated, professional [[taxidermy|taxidermist]]. In contrast to both his parents' girth, Lajoska appears pale and impoverished, with a thin anemic frame and haunted visage. When not working from his taxidermy shop or failing in his attempts to lead a normal life, Lajoska purchases groceries for his father Kálmán, who has grown so monstrously obese that he cannot leave the chair in his [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] apartment. Kálmán, who feeds butter to his caged cats, has nothing but harsh words for his son who, upon reaching his breaking point, abandons his father to his own prison. Returning later, he discovers that the cats have escaped their cages and, desiring meat, have eviscerated his father.

Lajoska stuffs his father and the cats. With little left to live for, he locks himself in a homemade surgical harness and through the use of sedatives, painkillers and a heart-lung machine, begins removing his own internal organs. Pumping his body full of preservatives and sewing himself up, he activates the machine that decapitates him, leaving behind a preserved statue. His body is displayed in an exhibit alongside the cats and his father.
