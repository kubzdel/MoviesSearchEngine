'''''Deep in the Woods''''' ({{lang-fr|Promenons-nous dans les bois}}) is a 2000 French [[horror film]] directed by Lionel Delplanque. The film is about a troupe of five young actors who are hired to perform at a remote chateau for Baron Axel De Ferson when they find out that a madman is on the loose murdering people.

The film was released in France on June 14, 2000 and won the award for "Best European Fantasy Film" at the 2000 [[Sitges Film Festival]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Plot==
As a mother reads [[Little Red Riding Hood]] to her son, she is killed before his eyes. Later, five young actors including Sophie Jeanne and her four friends are invited to the castle of Axel de Fersen to act in a modernized stage-play of ''Little Red Riding Hood''. They are greeted by the [[gamekeeper]] Stephane, Baron Berléand Fernsen, the owner who uses a wheelchair, and his deaf son Nicolas. After dinner, their host retires to bed as the five friends settle in for a night of drinking and dancing but soon find that the Baron has vanished, leaving only a blood stain. The actors return to party which upsets Sophie as she feels their behavior is disrespectful and oblivious to the danger. Sophie wants to leave the strange castle, but the others say that she could too easily get lost in the woods. Her friends are slowly killed one by one: Matilda is stabbed in the shower by a man disguised as a wolf and later Jeanne is killed. The three survivors begin to panic and try to find Stephane who they believe is the killer. When their other friend Wilfried is killed, Sophie accuses Matthew of being the murderer. This upsets Matthew, but the two soon meet up with the wolf: Axel de Fersen. Sophie manages to kill him and flees the castle with both Matthew and Nicolas.
