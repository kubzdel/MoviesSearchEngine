==Reception==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, stating that "this somewhat uneven but engrossing mini-triptych should please fans of Asian horror without necessarily scaring their pants off".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/tales-from-the-dark-part-1-review-1200562720/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Film Review: ‘Tales From the Dark Part 1’|author=Scheib , Ronnie|accessdate=19 October 2013|date=26 July 2013}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' referred to the film as a "mostly engaging film"  and that "Anthologies are by definition hit and miss endeavors and often swing wildly in quality from one segment to the next. That’s exactly what happens here, except the producers have wisely managed to bottom load the film so that sitting through the first entry eventually pays off."<ref name="hr-review">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/tales-dark-1-film-review-585472|title=Tales from the Dark 1: Film Review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Kerr, Elizabeth|date=15 July 2013|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref>
