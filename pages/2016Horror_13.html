'''''Antibirth''''' is a 2016 American-Canadian [[psychedelic film|psychedelic]] [[body horror|body horror film]] written and directed by Danny Perez, and starring [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Meg Tilly]], [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]], [[Maxwell McCabe-Lokos]] and [[Emmanuel Kabongo]]. The film follows a drug-addled woman in a remote [[Michigan]] town who becomes pregnant after taking a strange drug. The film premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2016. The film was released in the United States on September 2, 2016, by [[IFC Midnight]].

==Plot==
Lou ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) is a hard-partying [[Drug culture|stoner]] who lives in a run-down trailer outside a rural [[Michigan]] town where women have recently been going missing. She awakens one morning after a party at an abandoned warehouse and finds herself experiencing bizarre symptoms akin to those experienced during pregnancy. Her friend, Sadie ([[Chloë Sevigny]]) believes she is pregnant and not telling her about it, despite Lou's claims that she hasn't had sex with anyone in nearly a year. Lou also believes that it is impossible for her to get pregnant after an upsetting incident six months earlier when she miscarried in a club while on the toilet. After getting a ride from her friend Luke ([[Emmanuel Kabongo]]) to her cleaning job at a motel, she encounters an eccentric stranger, Lorna ([[Meg Tilly]]), who is staying in one of the hotel rooms. 

Meanwhile, Gabriel ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]), Sadie's drug dealer and boyfriend, is keeping a woman hidden in his apartment who has had a grotesque physical reaction to a new and strange drug Gabriel and his friend Warren have been selling to locals. It is revealed that Sadie, who had a child many years ago, is working to try to reunite with her estranged offspring, though Gabriel is doubtful it will ever happen. In addition to running drugs (including unstable, experimental drugs, some of which turned an underling's skin inside out upon sampling it), Gabriel works as a pimp; during an encounter between a prostitute and a client, a strange man, apparently familiar to Gabriel and later revealed to be Isaac, watches the intercourse take place, noting his interest in the encounter.

One afternoon, Lou loses consciousness and has bizarre [[hallucination]]s in which figures from Funzone, a local [[family entertainment center]] give her a vaginal exam. She awakens to find her stomach protruding, and a [[boil]] formed on her foot, which leaks a clear fluid after she cuts it open with a knife. When Lou regains consciousness, Lorna arrives at her trailer unannounced, and asks her if she's experienced a series of odd symptoms and mental fogginess; she claims to be [[clairvoyant]],and have noticed that Lou seemed troubled when she had met her at the motel. The two have lunch at the Funzone, and Lorna confesses that she was abducted by an unknown entity while enrolled in the [[military]], an event which led to her being discharged when she questioned her authorities. Lou confronts Warren, who works at the Funzone, about the night before she began experiencing her symptoms; he admits that Gabriel has been "trading" women, mostly runaways, to a mysterious man named Isaac in exchange for drugs to sell.

At her trailer, Lorna shows Lou a scar on her forearm, where she claims an [[Implant (medicine)|implant]] was inserted and then forcibly removed while she was in the military. Sadie arrives the next day, and suggests Lou see a doctor, but Lou insists she is not experiencing a pregnancy. Lou, Sadie, and Lorna go to visit the abandoned warehouse where the party had occurred the night before her symptoms began. There, she has a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] of being injected with a drug by Gabriel at the party. Sadie then confesses that Gabriel had used Lou as a test subject for the new drug—an experimental hormone for women—that he has been selling.

Back at Lou's trailer, Lorna attempts to give Lou a [[cesarian section]] to remove the growth in her stomach.  Instead, Lou gives birth to a grotesque, animated disembodied head. Just after the birth, Gabriel and Isaac arrive at the trailer along with another [[SWAT]] member who shoots Lorna. Isaac reveals that the military is investigating a way to create a new race that can survive the toxic atmosphere of space (which he has been to several times) and that her lifestyle of hard-drinking and drug use, as well as his secretly pumping toxins into her home, provided an ample womb for their experiment. He tells Lou that she can help him build a new, superior race, but she refuses to continue. As he explains this, arms begin to emerge from her vagina, followed by the whole of her [[cytoskeleton]], leaving her flesh an empty shell. The headless creature attacks and kills both Gabriel and Isaac. A [[SWAT]] member enters the trailer after hearing a commotion, and sees the trailer covered in blood, as the full-bodied creature stands in the kitchen, holding its head in its hands.

==Production==
The movie started from a desire by Perez to do something more focused on narrative than his usual work.<ref name="creatorproject">{{cite web|last1=Furino|first1=Giaco|title=Director Danny Perez on Fever-Dream Feature Film 'Antibirth' [Interview]|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/director-danny-perez-antibirth-interview|website=The Creators Project|publisher=Vice|accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref>  In designing the feature, Perez sought to work with a female lead, telling Daily Dead "narratively and visually I'm more interested in that." He created a script to deliberately "subvert a lot of female archetypes", specifically subverting the idea of how pregnancy is usually depicted as "this image of women as glowing in gestational bliss and being so happy".<ref name="Dailydeadsubvert">{{cite web|last1=Wixson|first1=Heather|title=Sundance 2016 Interview: Writer/Director Danny Perez Discusses ANTIBIRTH|url=http://dailydead.com/sundance-2016-interview-writerdirector-danny-perez-discusses-antibirth/|website=Dailydead|accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> "No one really talks about the more gruesome aspects of pregnancy and what it does to the body."<ref name="Dailydeadsubvert"/> In creating the narrative, Perez was also inspired by various [[conspiracy theory]] enthusiasts as well as "weird UFO [[YouTube]] videos".<ref name="creatorproject"/>

From the beginning, Perez wrote the film with Natasha Lyone in mind, whom he was personally friends with,<ref name="creatorproject"/> with her officially signing on in  May 2014 along with [[Chloë Sevigny]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/kaleidoscope-boards-sevigny-horror/5071942.article|title=Kaleidoscope boards Chloe Sevigny horror Antibirth|website=Screen Daily|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=May 17, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}</ref>

''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling it "good old body horror movie. It’s got the suggestion of pregnancy, so you’re dealing with the undertones of a woman’s mixed feelings about her own capacity to give life, but if you don’t want to go there it’s really just gross as hell."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3377678/sundance-review-antibirth-gross-hell/|work=Bloody-Disgusting|title=[Sundance Review] ‘Antibirth’ is Gross as Hell!|author=Topel, Fred|date=January 27, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref>  ''[[The Guardian]]'' also gave the film a positive review, drawing comparisons to ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' and [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[The Brood]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/27/antibirth-review-film-sundance-2016-natasha-lyonne-cronenberg-dude|work=The Guardian|title=Antibirth review - Natasha Lyonne makes a splash in whacked-out Dude-meets-Brood|author=Hoffman, Jordan|accessdate=January 28, 2016|date=January 27, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the film as resembling a "[[meth]] fever dream."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/movies/antibirth-natasha-lyonne-and-chloe-sevignys-sundance-reunion.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|title=‘Antibirth,’ Natasha Lyonne and Chloë Sevigny’s Sundance Reunion|author=Barnes, Brooks|date=January 26, 2016|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref>
