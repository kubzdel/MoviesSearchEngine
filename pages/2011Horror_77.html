==Plot==
The film tells the story of an "old monastery in a small, remote village in Suffolk, England that has been haunted by a local legend for centuries. Left in ruin and shrouded by the mystery of a dark spirit that wills young couples to suicide, the place has been avoided for years, marked only by a twisted, ancient tree with an ominous hollow said to be the home of great evil. When four friends on holiday explore the local folklore, they realize that belief in a myth can quickly materialize into reality, bringing horror to life for the town."<ref>[http://www.fearnet.com/videos/exclusive-clip-hollow-dinner-scene Fearnet.com], September 2012</ref>
