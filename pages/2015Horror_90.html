==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be generic and MUST NOT OVERREACH 400-700 WORDS! As of July 2016, the plot has over 497 words; IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD OR EXTEND ANY DETAILS! -->
A married couple, Simon and Robyn Callem, relocate from [[Chicago]] to a [[Los Angeles]] suburb after Simon takes a new job. While out shopping, they run into Gordon "Gordo" Moseley, Simon's former high school classmate. Gordo begins dropping in unannounced and delivering gifts including [[koi]] for their pond. He makes Simon uncomfortable, but Robyn sees no problem.

Gordo invites the couple to his large and elegant home. He receives a phone call and leaves abruptly, making Simon more suspicious. When he returns, Simon tells him to stay away from his family. The next day, Robyn finds the koi dead and their dog missing. Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, but discovers it is not actually his home. In the days following, Robyn suspects she is not alone in the house while Simon is at work. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills from her neighbor and one morning faints.

The dog returns and Robyn receives a letter of apology from Gordo. She is puzzled by his writing that he was "willing to let bygones be bygones". Simon says he does not know what it refers to and refuses to make peace with Gordo, telling Robyn that her pills are making her paranoid.

Robyn becomes pregnant. At her baby shower, Simon's sister tells her that, at school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo had been [[child molestation|molested]]. Gordo was bullied afterwards and had to transfer. Robyn finds Greg, who reveals that the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, who was a bully with a "real mean streak."  As a result of the story, Gordo's father thought he was [[homosexual]] and nearly killed him, before shipping him off to military school.  When asked why Simon would do such a thing, Greg replies "because he could."  Robyn searches Simon's home office and discovers that he has run background checks on Gordo - who has spent his life in and out of prison - and someone named Danny McDonald.

Robyn learns Simon has beaten Danny for a promotion after troubling information was revealed from Danny's previous job. Robyn confronts Simon about Gordo, but he denies responsibility. Simon angrily blames Robyn's suggestions of reconciliation on her own past traumas of being bullied at school. At Robyn's behest, Simon tracks down Gordo and half-heartedly apologizes, but Gordo does not accept his apology. Furious, Simon attacks him.

Simon's promotion party is interrupted by Danny, who says Simon fabricated the information that ruined his career. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. The next morning, Simon receives a call from his boss telling him that his fraud has been discovered and he won't be keeping his job. Robyn tells him that she wants to separate.

Simon goes home and finds another gift box, containing footage of Gordo preparing to [[sexual assault|sexually assault]] Robyn after she fainted months earlier. Meanwhile, Gordo visits Robyn in the hospital to congratulate her, wearing his arm in a sling; he tells her Simon injured him. Simon rushes to the hospital but misses Gordo. Gordo calls him soon after, taunting him, refusing to confirm or deny that he raped Robyn, leaving Simon to wonder whether the baby is his. Robyn, furious, refuses to let Simon see the baby. With his marriage and career destroyed, Simon breaks down. Gordo watches through a window and walks away, removing his arm sling.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 92%, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Gift'' is wickedly smart and playfully subversive, challenging the audience's expectations while leaving them leaning on the edges of their seats."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_gift_2015/|title=The Gift|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gives the film a score of 77 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-gift-2015 | title=The Gift |publisher=[[Metacritic]] | accessdate=August 26, 2015}}</ref> On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2015/08/fantastic-four-the-gift-shaun-the-sheep-box-office-1201495506/ |title=The Gift reviews |work=Deadline |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>
