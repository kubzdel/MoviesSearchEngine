'''''Halloween''''' is a 2007 American [[slasher film]] written, directed, and produced by [[Rob Zombie]]. The film is a [[Remake#Reimagine or renovate|remake/reimagining]] of the [[Halloween (1978 film)|1978 horror film of the same name]]; the first in the rebooted ''Halloween'' film series and the ninth installment of the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]]. The film stars [[Tyler Mane]] as the adult [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]],  [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]], and [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] as [[Laurie Strode]]; [[Daeg Faerch]] portrays a ten-year-old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's "reimagining" follows the premise of [[John Carpenter]]'s original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on [[Halloween]] night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.

Working from Carpenter's advice to "make [the film] his own",<ref name="Make own">{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/338/4589/Zombie,-Rob.html|title=Rob Zombie to Re-Make ''Halloween''|publisher=TheGauntlet.com|date=June 4, 2006|accessdate=December 19, 2006}}</ref> Zombie chose to develop the film as both a [[prequel]] and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. Despite mostly negative reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make,<ref name="budget"/> went on to gross $80,208,039 worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the ''Halloween'' franchise in unadjusted U.S. dollars. Zombie followed the film with a sequel, ''[[Halloween II (2009 film)|Halloween II]]'', in 2009.

==Plot==
On Halloween in Haddonfield, Illinois, having already exhibited signs of [[Psychopathy|psychopathic tendencies]], ten-year-old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] ([[Daeg Faerch]]) murders a school bully ([[Daryl Sabara]]), his older sister [[List of Halloween characters#Judith Myers|Judith]] ([[Hanna R. Hall]]), her boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Steve Haley|Steve]] ([[Adam Weisman]]), and his mother's boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Ronnie White|Ronnie]] ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]). Only his baby sister, Angel Myers, is spared. After one of the longest trials in the state's history, Michael is found guilty of [[first-degree murder]] and sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of [[child psychology|child psychologist]] Dr. [[Samuel Loomis]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]).

Michael initially cooperates with Loomis, claiming no memory of the killings; his mother [[List of Halloween characters#Deborah Myers|Deborah]] ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]), visits him regularly. Over the following year, Michael becomes fixated on [[papier-mâché]] masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even his mother. When Michael kills a nurse as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide.

For the next fifteen years, Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]) continues making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, decides to move on and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, killing the sanitarium employees in the process. He kills a truck driver for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.

Meanwhile, [[Laurie Strode]] ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]) and her friends [[Annie Brackett]] ([[Danielle Harris]]) and [[List of Halloween characters#Lynda Van Der Klok|Lynda Van Der Klok]] ([[Kristina Klebe]]) prepare for Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. Later that night, Laurie goes over to babysit [[List of Halloween characters#Tommy Doyle|Tommy Doyle]] ([[Skyler Gisondo]]). Meanwhile, Lynda meets up with her boyfriend [[List of Halloween characters#Bob Simms|Bob Simms]] ([[Nick Mennell]]) at Michael's abandoned home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, where he murders Laurie's parents, [[List of Halloween characters#Mason Strode|Mason]] ([[Pat Skipper]]) and [[List of Halloween characters#Cynthia Strode|Cynthia]] ([[Dee Wallace]]). Dr. Loomis, having been alerted of Michael's escape, arrives in Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn [[List of Halloween characters#Sheriff Leigh Brackett|Sheriff Leigh Brackett]] ([[Brad Dourif]]) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Loomis and Brackett head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is really Michael's baby sister, having been adopted by the Strodes following their mother's suicide.

Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit [[List of Halloween characters#Lindsey Wallace|Lindsey Wallace]] (Jenny Gregg Stewart) so that she can meet with her boyfriend Paul ([[Max Van Ville]]). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home and have sex; Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, badly hurt but still alive, and calls the police. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle home. Loomis and Brackett hear the 911 call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence.

Michael kidnaps Laurie and takes her back to their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, presenting a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie finds herself on top of an unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.

Zombie's intention was to reinvent Michael Myers because, in his opinion, the character, along with [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Jason Voorhees]], and [[Pinhead (Hellraiser)|Pinhead]], had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="MTV interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/flickd/z/rob_zombie_061026/|title=Evil Reborn: Zombie resurrects a horror classic|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}</ref> The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's [[back story]] and add "new life" to the character.<ref name="Zombie interview"/> Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film.<ref name="MTV interview 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1554005/20070306/story.jhtml|title=Zombie Kills 'Halloween' Theme Song, Revokes Myers' Driver's License|publisher=MTV|date=March 7, 2007|accessdate=April 10, 2007}}</ref> Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a [[psychopath]] really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have [[charisma]], which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, "[W]as he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?"<ref name="plot-interview"/>

Moreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield.<ref name="MTV interview 2"/> The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was "showing up merely to say something dramatic".<ref name="MTV interview"/> Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched).<ref name="Zombie interview"/> Production officially began on January 29, 2007.<ref name="breakdown">{{cite web|title=Official ''Halloween'' Casting Breakdown, Synopsis|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7683 |publisher=Bloody-Disgusting|date=November 22, 2007|accessdate=April 12, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218182240/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/7683 |archivedate = February 18, 2007}}</ref> Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, "It looks perfect, exactly like the original.

Approximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a [[workprint]] version of ''Halloween'' appeared online and was circulated around various [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] sites.

[[File:Malcolm McDowell LF.JPG|thumb|Various critics thought that [[Malcolm McDowell]] was perfectly cast as Loomis.]]
Peter Hartlaub, of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', felt Zombie was successful in both "[putting] his own spin on ''Halloween'', while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter's film"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost "sympathetic" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with ''Halloween'' slipping into "slasher-film logic".<ref>{{cite news |author=Peter Hartlaub |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/31/DDHPRT64J.DTL&type=movies|title=Zombie's 'Halloween' follows Michael Myers' psychotic roots|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 26, 2008}}</ref> Nathan Lee of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that ''Halloween'' may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it succeeded in "[deepening] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear".<ref>{{cite news|author=Nathan Lee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414155559/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0736,lee,77659,20.html|title=''Halloween'' review|work=[[The Village Voice]]|archivedate=April 14, 2008|date=August 28, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half.

''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the "imagery of violence"—than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jack Matthews|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/01/2007-09-01_rob_zombie_hacks_away_at_halloween_horro.html|title=Rob Zombie hacks away at 'Halloween' horror classic|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref> Dennis Harvey, from ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dennis Harvey|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934509.html?categoryid=31&cs=1|title=''Variety'' review|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 27, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref> In contrast, Rossiter Drake of ''The Examiner'' applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a "compelling take on the mythology" that managed to be "unique" and "shocking" at the same time.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Report|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/halloween-once-more-with-flaying/Content?oid=2148413|title='Halloween': Once more, with flaying|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}</ref> In agreement with other critics, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's [[Kim Newman]] felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film "[fell] flat" when it came to delivering suspense or anything "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the "dogged psychiatrist".<ref>{{cite news|author=Kim Newman|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/ReviewComplete.asp?FID=134964|title=''Empire'' review|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> Ben Walter, of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'', felt Zombie added "surprising realism" to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s "suspense and playfulness" with a convincing display of "black-blooded brutality".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Walter|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84559/halloween.html|title=Halloween review|work=Time Out London|accessdate=August 11, 2008}}</ref>

Frank Scheck, of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's ''Halloween'' was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so "brilliant", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character.<ref>{{cite news|author=Frank Scheck|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/home_entertainment/dvd_reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=10337|title=Halloween review|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 13, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519050112/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/home_entertainment/dvd_reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=10337 |archivedate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> By contrast, [[TV Guide]]'s Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a "scary horror movie", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of [[Wes Craven]] and [[Tobe Hooper]]'s "savage, greasy-haired '70s" films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent "[[Splatter film#Torture porn|torture porn]]" horror films.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ken Fox |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/halloween/review/289890 |title=''Halloween'' review|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=August 15, 2008}}</ref> Bill Gibron, of [[PopMatters]], believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true "boogeyman"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his "desire for death".<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Gibron|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/47762/short-cuts-in-theaters-halloween-2007/|title=Short Cuts - In Theaters: Halloween (2007) |work=PopMatters|date=August 31, 2007|accessdate=August 17, 2008}}</ref>
