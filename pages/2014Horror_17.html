'''''Army of Frankensteins''''' is a 2014 American science fiction horror film written and directed by Ryan Bellgardt.  It stars Jordan Farris as a time-traveling youth who, along with multiple versions of [[Frankenstein's monster]] (Eric Gesecus), are pulled into the [[American Civil War]].

== Plot ==
After Alan Jones is savagely beaten by a street gang, he ends up at the lab of mad scientist Dr. Tanner Finski                                 and his assistant Igor, a child genius.  There, Jones discovers that he is the key to an experiment that involves Frankenstein's monster.  When the experiment goes wrong, Finski sends Jones and Igor back in time to the American Civil War, where an interdimensional portal has allowed an army of monsters to converge.

For Dr. Finski, he always sought John Ferguson, who had played [[horror host]] Count Gregore.<ref name=release/> Gesecus, a fan of classic ''Frankenstein'' films, won his part partially through his knowledge of the classic monster.  Gesecus was initially wary of becoming involved in a local, low budget effort, but his love for the character won out.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-actor-fulfills-dream-of-playing-frankenstein-monster/article/3898087|title=Oklahoma actor fulfills dream of playing Frankenstein monster|last=Sutton|first=Jonathan|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=2013-10-27|accessdate=2015-01-08}}</ref>

== Reception ==
Megan Sando of the ''[[NewsPress|Stillwater News Press]]'' called it a "hilarious sci-fi adventure" whose "gory special effects make up for the sometimes questionable acting".<ref name=stillwater/>  Mark L.
