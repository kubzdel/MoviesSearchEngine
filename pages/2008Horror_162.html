==Reception==
Thomas M. Sipos of Hollywood Investigator wrote that it is a slasher film but not quite a horror film. And of the film's protagonist, wrote "He's psychotic, but he's also vulnerable, literate, and identifiable. He has more common with the suspense psychos of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[Frenzy]]'' than with the superhuman psychos of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and its progeny."<ref name="HI1"/> Dread Central wrote that "Henry Thomas yet again proves to be one of those hidden gems", and that "''Red Velvet'' is deranged and inspired in equal measures, sometimes both at the same time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/red-velvet-2008|title=review: Red Velvet|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref>
