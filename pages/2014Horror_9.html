==Reception==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
''Grolsch Film Works'' praised ''Altergeist'', writing that it "fully exploits its unusual vineyard setting, makes fun of its own hackneyed tropes..., and finds novel ways to reverse-engineer an apparent ghost story into something with a rather different genre frame."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=THE BEST (AND NOT-SO-BEST) OF FRIGHTFEST 2014|url=http://grolschfilmworks.com/ca/features/the-best-and-not-so-best-of-frightfest-2014|publisher=Grolsch Film Works|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[Fangoria]]'' gave the film three out of four skulls, writing that "Despite its dark setting and often fairly horrific murder sequences, ''ALTERGEIST'' is light hearted stuff, with clever banter and humor amongst the group of hunters, and actor Brendan Fletcher (''[[Freddy vs. Jason|FREDDY vs. JASON]]'') being exceptionally funny throughout."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Michael|title=“ALTERGEIST” (Movie Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/altergeist-movie-review/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>
