== History and development ==
{{rewrite section|date=June 2018}}
Hussain began filming ''Subconscious Cruelty'' at the age of 19 after connecting with 22-year-old Davis, a producer whom Hussain knew to believe in the project. Hussain felt that the [[subculture]] of the mid-1990s, a time when [[heroin]] usage was prevalent and [[nihilism]] was gaining acceptance in the art world, would be accepting of his film. Influences for the film include works by [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]], [[Luis Buñuel]], [[Dušan Makavejev]], [[David Lynch]], [[David Cronenberg]] and others.<ref name="dir-com">{{cite web|url=http://www.inflictionfilms.com/html/cruelty/dir-com.htm |title=Subconscious Cruelty: Director's Statement |publisher=InflictionFilms.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

The filmmaking process was beset by various problems, including the disappearance of the film [[Negative (photography)|negative]] in a financial dispute, forcing Hussain to hand-cut the [[Transparency (photography)|positive]] of the film without knowing if he would ever re-gain the negative. Another setback occurred when Hussain was stopped at the [[Canada–United States border]] after a business trip to the [[United States of America|United States]]. Canadian [[customs]] officials inspected the film, and, appalled by its content, confiscated it as illegally [[obscenity|obscene]] material. As a result, the original stock had to be hidden for a long period of time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inflictionfilms.com/html/cruelty/p-histo.htm |title=Subconscious Cruelty: Production History |publisher=InflictionFilms.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>

As the film toured various festivals, it gained a cult following that led to Davis and Hussain seeking out a DVD distributor.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The film was first produced on DVD in Japan in 2001, and later in several European countries in 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Critical reception ==
''Subconscious Cruelty'' received mixed reviews by mostly non-mainstream critics. Since the film was not released in the US market, traditional critics of English-language films did not see or comment on it. Known establishments such as [[Fangoria]] considered it "a film suffused with images that incite thoughts, many of which would be considered unhealthy in any artistic medium",<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/dvd_review.php?id=4489 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217154808/http://www.fangoria.com/dvd_review.php?id=4489 |date=December 17, 2007 }}</ref> while some other independent critics considered it "the most amateurish cinematic junk I have ever seen...".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews12/subconcious-cruelty.htm |title=Karim Hussain's – Subconscious Cruelty – Sazuma – Region 2 – PAL |publisher=Dvdbeaver.com |date=2000-10-12 |accessdate=2010-09-14}}</ref>
