==Plot==
Best friends Wallace Bryton and Teddy Craft host the popular [[podcast]] ''The Not-See Party'', where they find and mock humiliating viral videos. Wallace announces plans to fly to Canada to interview the "Kill Bill" Kid, an Internet celebrity famous for severing his leg with a samurai sword. In flashbacks spread throughout the film, it is revealed that Wallace was originally a failed stand-up comic who became popular with his increasingly vicious podcasts, and that he frequently cheats on his girlfriend, Ally.

Upon arriving in [[Manitoba]], Wallace is surprised to learn that the ''Kill Bill'' Kid committed suicide. Upset that he flew to Canada for nothing, Wallace decides to stay an extra day and find another person to interview. He finds a handbill from someone offering a room in his home for free and the guarantee of hearing a lifetime of interesting stories. His interest piqued, Wallace arrives at the mansion of Howard Howe, a retired seaman in a wheelchair. Howard tells the story of how a [[walrus]], whom he named Mr. Tusk, rescued him after a shipwreck. Wallace then passes out from the [[secobarbital]] laced in his tea that Howard made for him.

The next morning, Wallace wakes up to find himself strapped into a wheelchair and his left leg amputated. Howard tells him he was bitten by a [[brown recluse spider]] and a local doctor had to amputate it to save Wallace's life. Howard not only reveals that he can still walk, but lays out his plans for Wallace: he plans to fit Wallace into a perfectly constructed walrus costume. Wallace's attempts to contact Teddy and Ally fail when neither answer their phone. It is then revealed that Ally and Teddy are in fact lovers. Wallace leaves Ally a voicemail apologizing for how he treated her, and Howard knocks him unconscious.

Now aware that Wallace is in danger, Ally and Teddy fly to Canada to look for him. Back at the mansion, Howard continues to mutilate and alter Wallace, to whom he tells his backstory: a [[Duplessis orphans|Duplessis orphan]], he was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] for years by the clergy who fostered him. True to his plan, He creates a costume over Wallace to give Wallace a complete Walrus look, by sewing together pieces of human skin to make the body and using the tibia bones from Wallace's severed legs as the tusks.

A local detective puts Ally and Teddy in touch with Guy LaPointe, a former [[Sûreté du Québec]] inspector who has been hunting Howard for years. LaPointe reveals that Howard, nicknamed “The First Wife", has been kidnapping and murdering people for years; he says he believes Wallace may still be alive, but not as they remember him. They eventually find Howard's address through [[Yoga Hosers|two convenience store clerks]], whom Wallace had annoyed earlier.

Meanwhile, Wallace continues to be [[classical conditioning|conditioned]] to behave like and act as like a walrus. Howard reveals that his obsession with walruses comes from killing and eating Mr. Tusk six months after living on the island, although a rescue boat arrived soon after. For the past 15 years, he has attempted to turn his victims into his beloved savior in order to relive their last day and give Mr. Tusk another chance at survival. With Howard dressed in his own homemade pelt, the two become engaged in a fight that ends with Wallace angrily impaling Howard on his tusks; Howard dies, but is satisfied to have fulfilled his life's mission at last. Ally and Teddy enter the enclave, horrified by Wallace's altered Walrus appearance and bellowing vocalization like one. LaPointe later enters the room and reluctantly aims a shotgun at Wallace.

One year later, Wallace still has not been released from inside the pelt and now lives in a wildlife sanctuary. Ally and Teddy visit him and feed him a mackerel. Ally remembers a discussion she had with Wallace the day before he left for Canada about how crying separates humans from animals, because crying shows that you have a soul. Ally tells Wallace she still loves him before walking off crying. A tear is running out of one of Wallace's eyes as he watches them go, implying that the human part of Wallace may not be completely gone.

==Production==
The idea for the film came during the recording of [[SModcast]] 259 ''The Walrus and The Carpenter''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smodcast.com/episodes/the-walrus-and-the-carpenter/|title=The Walrus and The Carpenter|publisher=[[SModcast]]|date=June 25, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> In the episode, Smith with his longtime friend and producer [[Scott Mosier]] discussed an article featuring a [[Gumtree]] ad where a homeowner was offering a living situation free of charge, if the lodger agrees to dress as a walrus. The discussion went on from there, resulting in almost an hour of the episode being spent on reconstructing and telling a hypothetical story based on the ad. Smith then told his Twitter followers to tweet "#WalrusYes" if they wanted to see their hypothetical turned into a film, or "#WalrusNo" if they did not. A vast majority of Smith's following agreed that the film should be made.<ref name="shoot">{{cite web|url=http://silentbobspeaks.com/?p=1001|title=Tusk starts shooting today!|last=Smith|first=Kevin|publisher=silentbobspeaks.com|date=November 4, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref> The post on Gumtree was in fact a prank post by noted [[Brighton]] poet and prankster [[Chris Parkinson (poet)|Chris Parkinson]], who upon hearing of the planned film said he was a big fan of Smith and that he would love to be involved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10592419.I_am_the_walrus__Brighton_prankster_behind_bizarre_Gumtree_ad_to_be_turned_into_Hollywood_film/|title=I am the walrus: Brighton prankster behind bizarre Gumtree ad to be turned into Hollywood film|last=James|first=Ben|date=August 5, 2013|work=[[The Argus (Brighton)|The Argus]]|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> Smith eventually hired Parkinson as an associate producer in November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/11/15/kevin-smith-makes-a-producer-out-of-man-who-wrote-ad-that-inspired-tusk/|title=Kevin Smith Makes A Producer Out Of Man Who Wrote Ad That Inspired Tusk|last=Johnson|first=Scott|date=November 15, 2013|publisher=ComicBook.com|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref>

Smith wrote the 80-page screenplay while waiting for [[Bob Weinstein]]'s approval of his ''Clerks III'' submission package. It was originally titled ''The Walrus & the Carpenter'', but he changed it into a single-word title, saying he "knew what a movie about a walrus had to be called."

Smith was excited about making ''Tusk'', saying "I wanted to right what I felt was the only wrong of ''[[Red State (2011 film)|Red State]]'' by scripting something with no religious or sexual politics that could grow up to be a weird little movie and not an indie film call-to-arms or a frustrated self-distribution manifesto.

===Critical reception===
''Tusk'' was met with mixed reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a rating of 42%, based on 120 reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10. The site's summary reads, "''Tusk'' is pleasantly ridiculous and charmingly self-deprecating, but that isn't enough to compensate for its thin, overstretched story."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tusk_2014/|title=Tusk (2014)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> [[The Guardian]] rated the movie 4 out of 5 stars with complementing the director as best to his snarky best.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/tusk-review-kevin-smith-toronto-film-festival-horror-walrus|title=Tusk review: Kevin Smith seals his comeback with walrus horror show|last=Barnes|first=Henry|date=2014-09-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/tusk|title=Tusk Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= October 12, 2014}}</ref>

In his review for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', Erik Lundegaard gave the film zero out of four stars, stating, "''Tusk'', which is based on one of Smith's own podcasts, is the most disgusting and pointless movie I've seen.

Conversely, Chris Bumbray of [[JoBlo.com]] had a positive reaction, calling ''Tusk'' "a major return to form for Smith, and an exciting new chapter in a career that now feels totally reinvigorated."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/review-tusk-tiff-2014-159|title=Review: Tusk (TIFF 2014) + Video Review! - Movie News|date=September 6, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2014|website=JoBlo.com|last=Bumbray|first=Chris}}</ref> Roth Cornet from [[IGN]] gave the film eight out of ten and stated "Funny, strange, disquieting, and occasionally gory, ''Tusk'' is Kevin Smith at his best."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/19/tusk-review|title=Tusk review – I am he as you are he as you are me|last=Cornet|first=Roth|date=September 18, 2014|website= [[IGN]].com |accessdate= September 20, 2014}}</ref> [[Richard Roeper]] also gave ''Tusk'' a positive review, writing, "I'm recommending Kevin Smith’s uniquely twisted 'Tusk', but there's a part of me that wishes I could un-see it.
