==Plot==
Thirty years ago, an unborn child was buried in the garden of what is now a boardinghouse in [[Cubao]]. It lies beneath the ground, unbeknownst to the tenants who live there. One of the tenants is Mylene ([[Lovi Poe]]) who appears like the perfect girl, nice, pretty and at the top of her medicine class. But nobody knows about her past, not even the man who loves her most, Paolo ([[Benjamin Alves]]). Paolo doesn't know anything about Mylene's family, her long, lost sibling or her estranged, nervous wreck of a mother. Nor does he know about the very long scar that runs across Mylene's body, nor of how incomplete she always feels. And he finds that the more he tries to win back her love, the more she retreats to her secret world that nobody could enter.

One day Mylene is asked to perform an abortion for a fee, she feels conflicted about doing what is right and at the same time, being in dire need of tuition fee. Her decision ultimately leads to a dark outcome and awakens a force that has laid quiet for years in the boardinghouse grounds. Thereafter, she becomes tormented by nightmares of a dark twin, whose presence gets stronger as days pass, as strange things start to happen in the house. When one by one, the boarders die of unexplainable causes, Joanna ([[Empress Schuck|Empress]]) the resident psychic and Mylene's best friend struggles to understand the impending danger that she senses and decides to get to the bottom of the mystery; and as it unravels, they find themselves confronted by an angry soul that seeks justice.<ref>[http://smcinema.com/smcinema/index.php?p=1743&bid=&mov=443&title=Guni-guni&st=3 Guni-Guni Synopsis] ''SM Cinema''.
