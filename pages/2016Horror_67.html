'''''The Forest''''' is a 2016 American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Jason Zada]] and written by [[Ben Ketai]], [[Nick Antosca]], and Sarah Cornwell. Starring [[Natalie Dormer]] and [[Taylor Kinney]], it follows a young woman who travels to [[Aokigahara]] (the suicide forest) to find her sister.

The film, released on January 8, 2016, in the United States by [[Gramercy Pictures]], was negatively received by critics but was a box office success, grossing $37.6 million against a reported budget of $10 million.

==Plot==
The majority of the story is set in and around the [[Aokigahara|Aokigahara Forest]], a forest at the northwest base of [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan known as a popular destination for suicide.

Sara Price ([[Natalie Dormer]]), an American woman, receives a phone call from the Japanese police telling her that they think her troubled twin sister Jess Price (also Dormer) is dead, as she was seen going into Aokigahara forest. Despite the concerns of her fiancé, Rob, she journeys to Japan and arrives at the hotel where her sister was staying.

At her hotel, Sara meets a reporter named Aiden. They drink together, and she tells him of her parents' death. In reality, her father killed her mother, then committed suicide, but she tells him they were killed by a drunk driver. Her sister saw the bodies, but she didn't look. Aiden invites her to go into the forest with him and a park guide, Michi, so she can look for her sister.

As the three enter Aokigahara, Michi tells Sara that Jess has most likely killed herself. Sara refuses to believe this, explaining how, being a twin, she can "feel" that Jess is still alive. Deep in the woods, the group discovers a yellow tent that Sara recognizes as Jess's. With nightfall approaching, Michi suggests they leave a note for Jess and leave. Sara refuses, and Aiden volunteers to stay with her through the night.

That night, Sara hears rustling in the bushes and, believing it may be Jess, rushes into the woods after her. Sara finds a Japanese girl, Hoshiko, who claims to know Jess. The girl warns Sara not to trust Aiden and flees at the sound of his voice. Sara attempts to chase after her but falls and loses her.

The next day, Aiden and Sara become lost and begin to walk around the forest. As they walk, Sara's suspicions are raised and she demands Aiden to give her his phone and finds a picture of Jess on it. Aiden denies any involvement with Jess, but Sara runs into the forest alone. While running she begins to hear voices telling her to turn around. She appears to be unfazed by this until she hears the voice directly behind her. She turns around to see a hanging body and continues to run away. She then falls through a hole into a cave and goes unconscious, later she wakes up and discovers that she is in the cave with Hoshiko, who turns out to be a ''[[yūrei]]''. Hoshiko then turns into what appears to be a "demonic figure". Sara then runs back towards the cave's opening, where Aiden finds her and helps her out of the cave.  After some convincing, they continue to walk together.

Aiden brings Sara to an old ranger station he claims he'd discovered while looking for her. Sara hears her sister's voice coming from a locked basement, and finds a note which implies that Aiden is holding Jess captive in the basement. Convinced that he is a threat, Sara attacks and kills Aiden with a small kitchen knife. As he dies, Sara realizes that Aiden was telling the truth and that the picture on his phone, the voice at the basement door and the note had all been hallucinations.

In the basement of the ranger station, Sara sees a vision of the night her parents died. The ghost of her father suddenly appears and lunges toward her, grabbing her wrist. She cuts his fingers away from her wrist and escapes the station. Running into the forest, she sees Jess running toward the lights of the search party. Sara calls to her sister, who is unable to hear her. She realizes that her escape from the ranger station was another hallucination. When she cut at her father's fingers she was actually cutting deep into her own wrists, and is now dying from blood loss in the basement. As she succumbs to her wounds, hands of a group of ''yūrei'' pull Sara into the forest floor. Her very much alive sister is rescued by the search party and explains that the "feeling" of her sister is gone and it is assumed that Jess knows Sara is dead. As the search party leaves, Michi is seen staring at a figure and realizes that it's Sara's spirit.

Goyer came up with the idea after reading a [[Wikipedia]] article on [[Aokigahara]]. Surprised that a horror film had not been made about it he came up with a rough outline.<ref name="Shockyagoyer">{{cite web|last1=BENARDELLO|first1=KAREN|title=Interview: David S.

It was not a place where I wanted to spend the night." <ref name="ShockyaZeda"/>

In October 2014, it was reported [[Natalie Dormer]] had joined the cast of the film.<ref name="Variety 10-21-14">{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=‘Game of Thrones’ Actress Natalie Dormer Joins Supernatural Thriller ‘The Forest’|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/natalie-dormer-the-forest-1201335421/|accessdate=October 30, 2014|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 21, 2014}}</ref> in April 2015, it was announced that [[Taylor Kinney]] had joined the cast as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/taylor-kinney-chicago-fire-the-forest-1201413214/|title=‘Chicago Fire’s Taylor Kinney Lights Up ‘The Forest’|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref>

Dormer cited the opportunity to play two characters in one film enticed her to accept the role. "That's like a life tick box as an actor, to be playing against yourself. It's certainly surreal," she said. "(But) it's hard to make choices as Sara when you don't quite know how you're going to play it as Jess yet. You haven't got the other actor to react against. You have to be a bit schizophrenic."<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/06/natalie-dormer-the-forest-movie/78317666/ USA Today Dorner Role</ref>

Kinney cited a confluence of reasons for accepting the role: the story and its location, the ability to tweak his character, and the attachment of Dormer. He stated he was looking for something "more cerebral than gory slasher films", in the vein of ''[[The Amityville Horror (1979 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', as well as the [[Stephen King]] adaptations ''[[Cujo (film)|Cujo]]'', ''[[Pet Sematary (film)|Pet Sematary]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.<ref>http://www.shockya.com/news/2016/01/05/interview-taylor-kinney-talks-the-forest-exclusive/ Shockya- Kinney</ref>

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 10%, based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Forest'' offers Natalie Dormer a few chances to showcase her range in a dual role, but they aren't enough to offset the fact that the movie's simply not all that scary."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_forest_2016/ | title=The Forest | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 34 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-forest | title=The Forest reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/the-revenant-star-wars-the-force-awakens-weekend-box-office-1201678383/ |title=‘Force Awakens’ Crosses $800M On Saturday & Holds No. 1, ‘Revenant’ Taking No. 2 With $38M |work=deadline.com}}</ref>

Brian Truitt of ''[[USA Today]]'' thought the movie was a "mostly scare-free zone", and gave it 2 out of 4 possible stars. He teased the premise of the movie, saying that "[i]t’s OK to go into these woods because there’s not much to get spooked by in ''The Forest'', unless you’re creeped out by the occasional Japanese schoolgirl." Comparing the film to some of its peers, he wrote the movie is "definitely a step up from screaming teenagers and some guy running through trees with a chainsaw", but expressed disappointment that the "film never makes the most of its conceit".<ref> https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/07/review-the-forest-movie-natalie-dormer/78374328/ USA Today Review</ref>

Peter Keough of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' zeroed in on the writing as a source of fault, while approving of the acting and directing, writing "Zada gets credible performances from Dormer and Kinney, but their characters undergo such unlikely psychological contortions that these efforts are to no avail." He echoed the complaints of most critics, saying "Had Zada strayed more from the generic path into such unknown territory, ''The Forest'' might have had genuine depth and darkness".<ref>https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2016/01/07/the-forest-offers-horror-some-japanese-woods/KgEwSpflJTdRNOMT5R5UWI/story.html Boston Globe</ref>

Alonso Duralde, writing for [[TheWrap]], voiced these gripes as well, faulting the writing is saying "By the time screenwriters Ben Ketai, Sarah Cornwell and Nick Antosca unpack the inevitable third-act reversals and twists, it’s too little, too late, especially since those revelations rely upon an investment in the characters that the movie has expended too little effort in creating." He praised Dormer as well ("Dormer, for her part, invests herself in the proceedings, and manages to build two characters out of a script that barely bothers to give her one"), while panning Kinney ("so wooden here he could be playing the title role").<ref>http://www.thewrap.com/the-forest-review-natalie-dormers-wonder-twin-act-cant-spark-wooden-fright-flick/ The Wrap</ref>

Neil Genzlinger, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', also praised Dormer's performance, while finding enough within the rest of the film's aspects to give the movie a positive review: "a decently executed creeper built around a convincing performance by Natalie Dormer."<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/movies/review-the-forest-centers-on-the-search-for-a-twin-at-a-suicide-site-in-japan.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&_r=0 NYT</ref> Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also allotted the film a positive review, writing "Dormer is sympathetic enough in her double scream-queen roles, and Zada shows an occasional aptitude for generating suspense through framing, music and sound design, even if the beats he hits are often tediously familiar."<ref>https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-forest-review-natalie-dormer-1201674034/ Variety</ref>

''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]<nowiki>'</nowiki>''s David Ehrlich said that the film's release date was the most significant indicator of its lack of quality. "Every year, during the first proper weekend of January, the studios' niche labels trot out the horror movies they know have nothing to contribute to society and leave them for dead in your local multiplex," he wrote. "[A]nybody with access to a calendar already knows that ''The Forest'' is bad; at this point, that's less of a presumption than it is a tradition." Keeping with the film's setting and themes, he likened [[Dump months|the practice of releasing such films at that time of year]] to the supposed ancient Japanese custom of ''[[ubasute]]'', in which elderly people who could no longer take care of themselves were abandoned to their fate on a mountain.<ref name="Slate review">{{cite news|last=Ehrlich|first=David|title=The Forest|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2016/01/horror_movie_the_forest_starring_natalie_dormer_reviewed.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}</ref>

==Controversy==
The film attracted controversy for what some believed to be trivializing the issue of [[suicide in Japan]] as well as disrespecting the people who have died in the real life forest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/the-forest-suicide-as-a-spooky-farce/423306/ |title=The Forest: The Problem With Trying to Make Suicide Spooky |last=Cruz |first=Lenika |date=9 January 2016 |publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]'' |access-date=7 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = https://psmag.com/social-justice/go-see-carol-instead|title = 'The Forest' Plays Suicide for Cheap Scares|date = 14 January 2016|access-date = 11 May 2016|website = [[Pacific Standard]]|last = Alexander|first = Damian}}</ref> Critic [[Kevin Maher (writer)|Kevin Maher]] wrote in his review that "''The Forest'' is a dumb and dreary horror movie that's notable only for its racial insensitivities, lack of horror, and for making Natalie Dormer from ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' play identical twins distinguished only by hair colour."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/reviews/article4699533.ece |title=The Forest |last=Maher |first=Kevin |date=26 February 2016 |publisher=''[[The Times]]'' |access-date=7 April 2016}}</ref>

The film's plot has been compared to the 2011 comic book ''The Suicide Forest'', also taking place in the Aokigahara Forest, written by El Torres and illustrated by Gabriel Hernández.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cinemania.es/noticias/han-pirateado-mis-comics/|title = ¡Han pirateado mis cómics!|date = 15 January 2016|access-date = 11 May 2016|website = Cinemanía |last = Piñón |first = Manuel |language = Spanish}}</ref>
