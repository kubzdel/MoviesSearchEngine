==Plot==
Brett Wilson conducts paranormal investigations. He has a popular TV show that airs on a science fiction channel. Ghost hunting, as it has now been dubbed, is the process of
investigating locations said to be haunted by paranormal activity that could indicate the presence of spirits or entities not of this world.

Tragedy strikes Brett. His wife passes away and as a result he questions the existence of the afterlife. His show continues to do well but he harbors guilt for not being there when she needed him most.

As he reflects on his priorities, he shocks those around him when he suddenly decides to retire. The network threatens to sue him if he doesn’t at least provide a series finale. He reluctantly agrees to take on the finale when he receives a strange and desperate call from a potential client who claims Brett’s wife is in his home.

==Production==
Writer/director Eric Espejo has been a huge fan of the horror genre, but not your slasher type flick. He believes using your imagination, rather than a slow-moving monster is more frightening. If the concept of a horror film is somewhat plausible then it enhances the fear. Being a skeptic of shows that feature ghost hunters, he attempted to focus on what could potentially happen on an investigation to these researchers that would absolutely blow them away.
