== Plot ==
After the event [[Kuntilanak (film )|in the previous film]], Sam ([[Julie Estelle]]) has cut her romantic ties with Agung and currently in a great dilemma for struggling to maintain her true self against the dark side within her that are growing strong through the wangsit (supernatural mandate) of Kuntilanak. Her dark side is poised to kill as many people she can by summoning the Kuntilanak. Sam also have recurrent dreams involving the victims murdered by the Kuntilanak, among others were her friend, Dinda, and the leader of the Mangkoedjiwo sect, Sri Sukma ([[Alice Iskak]]), who expresses  regret in her occult involvement pertaining to the  Kuntilanak. Presently, Sam lived in a rental room at the house of a Chinese-descent shop-owner. The family's young daughter, Yenny ([[Cindy Valerie]]), is frightened the moment she set her eyes at Sam, but her parents is puzzled at why. At the other side, the remnants of the sect of Mangkoedjiwo who just lost their leader Sri Sukma, now faced countless problem in their supernatural dealings (the sect operates for occult purposes such as preparing the "tumbal" or sacrifices as required by their client for magic rituals or plain murder-hiring using the Kuntilanak) because they can no longer control the Kuntilanak. The sect followers planned to force Sam who have the wangsit, making her capable of summoning and controlling the Kuntilanak, to join them in order to continue their abominable works by tracking Yanti, Sri Sukma's assistant and former manager of Sam's boarding house who has been hiding since the death of Sri Sukma. Meanwhile, Agung ([[Evan Sanders]]) became mentally disturbed after his experience of being kidnapped by the Kuntilanak. He is advised by his friend, Iwank ([[Ibnu Jamil]]), to find Sam and eliminate his fear from the root by researching the sect of Mangkoedjiwo. One night, Sam call Iwank's telephone and sings the chant. Iwank then died due to accident while cooking at the kitchen, perpetrated by the Kuntilanak. This tragedy motivated Agung to find Sam. Later on, Sam confronted her dark side who tries to took over her body but managed to be kept at bay by her.

After a long search, Agung managed to track down and find Sam who just went home from visiting the tomb of Mega N. Widjoko, her deceased mother. At first Sam didn't want Agung to be involved in the matter, but after been coaxed and thinking on her own, Sam agrees and the couple get back together. Through Iwank's research, Sam and Agung discover the writing of "Oejong Sedo" in the scattered manuscripts of Mangkoedjiwo that is said to be the origin place of the Kuntilanak's wangsit. Sam and Agung later meet Yanti ([[Lita Soewardi]]) who before this contacted Sam via supernatural telepathy, asking the girl to seek her. Yanti then divulges that the Mangkoedjiwo sect is now in frantic moves, searching for Sam to include her into their evil circle. The former also warned Sam of how the Kuntilanak is now unrestrained after the latter has destroyed the gateway mirrors and who may posed deadly threat on her. When Sam asked on how to end the curse, Yanti interjected her question by asking her when is the last time she visit her mother's tomb. Minutes later, three followers from the Mangkoedjiwo sect came and killed Yanti, but afterward Sam sings the chant to summon the Kuntilanak who killed two of them.

Sam and Agung later went to hide at her rental house. They was helped by Yenny's grandfather ([[Sutan Amanullah]]), but he was later revealed to be one of the follower of Mangkoedjiwo sect. After killing Yenny's parent, the followers of Mangkoedjiwo captured Sam, Agung, and Yenny, and the trio were brought to the sect's meeting place. There, Sam was forced to give in to her anger in order for the sect followers to place her under trance and properly summoning the Kuntilanak. Agung was fatally injured while been attacked by one of the sect follower, but he reassured Sam of her true, good inner self before dying. Determined to put an end to the sect, Sam sings the chant and  commanded the Kuntilanak to kill all the followers of Mangkoedjiwo sect while making her escape with Yenny. However when they reached the courtyard, Yenny was snatched by the Kuntilanak, leaving the dumbfounded Sam who suddenly meets her supposedly-dead mother, Mega ([[Ida Iasha]]).
