Seven teenagers from [[Jakarta]], Diska (Thalita Annemarie Latief), Naya (Salvita), Cika (Bunga Jelita), Dinda (Tsania Marwa), Yugo (Marcell Darwin), Armen (Melvin) and Onil (Ronald Gustav), are in Semarang to celebrate their graduation from high school. All but Diska, driving the car, are drunk after going to a discoth√®que. On the way to Naya's grandmother's house, Armen, Onil, and Yugo ask Diska to pull over so that they can relieve themselves; they stop at Lawang Sewu, and the boys urinate onto the grounds from outside the fence. Cika, who also must urinate, does not feel comfortable with the boys and so goes into the complex to relieve herself.

When she does not come back, the six enter the complex to look for her. The ghosts inhabiting the complex, angered by their lack of respect for the property, begin to frighten them. The first to come is the ghost of a [[Dutch people|Dutchwoman]], Noni van Ellen, who [[Spirit possession|possesses]] Dinda and causes her to insult the others. After Dinda returns to normal, Diska yells at her for violating the sanctity of the building by entering it while [[Menstruation|menstruating]]. Onil is told to take Dinda outside, but before they can leave the complex they are approached by a [[kuntilanak]] with a ball and chain wrapped around her leg; Onil wets his pants, and the two hug as the ghost approaches them.

Meanwhile, Diska, Yugo, Armen, and Naya find Cika's body inside the building. As they are attempting to take the corpse away, the kuntilanak comes and chases them. Diska makes it outside the building, but Armen, Yugo, and Naya are chased into the basement, where they are terrorized by the kuntilanak. Diska drives away to get help from Naya's grandmother. When they return, they attempt to drive away the ghosts by performing an [[exorcism]]; the ghosts rise up and kill Naya's grandmother, driving Diska into the basement.

There, she meets up with Armen, Yugo, and Naya. Armen tells her that he knows who the kuntilanak is: his ex-girlfriend Ratih. Ratih, [[Unintended pregnancy|unintentionally pregnant]] with Armen's child, was chased out of Jakarta by Armen and his friends; Diska, who wanted to help her, was stopped by Naya and Cika. Upon arriving in her hometown of Semarang, Ratih was disowned by her family and in desperation threw herself into a well at Lawang Sewu.

Upon learning the truth, Diska runs to the well in order to close it. Meanwhile, the kuntilanak kills Naya and Armen. As the kuntilanak is preparing to kill Yugo, Diska manages to close the well and stop it. Together Diska and Yugo leave to go to their own homes.
