}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Human Centipede (First Sequence)''}}
'''''The Human Centipede (First Sequence)''''' is a <!-- Please see [[WP:FILMRELEASE]]. -->2009 Dutch [[horror film]] written, directed, and co-produced by [[Tom Six]]. The film tells the story of a [[Germany|German]] [[surgeon]] who kidnaps three tourists and joins them [[Surgery|surgically]], mouth to [[human anus|anus]], forming a "human [[centipede]]", a conjoined triplet. It stars [[Dieter Laser]] as the creator of the centipede, Dr Josef Heiter, with [[Ashley C. Williams]], [[Ashlynn Yennie]], and [[Akihiro Kitamura]] as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a [[child sexual abuse|child molester]] by stitching his mouth to the anus of a "fat truck driver". Inspiration for the film also came from [[Nazi human experimentation|Nazi medical experiments]] carried out during [[World War II]], such as the crimes of [[Josef Mengele]] at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].

When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of ''The Human Centipede'' did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States on a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] on 30 April 2010. Two sequels, titled ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)|Full Sequence]]'' and ''[[The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)|Final Sequence]]'', also written and directed by Six, were released in 2011 and 2015 respectively. The entire trilogy was compiled into a single film in 2016, titled ''Complete Sequence'', which Six described as a "movie centipede" due to each ''Sequence'' leading into its successor, while simultaneously working as a separate standalone film.

==Plot==
Lindsay ([[Ashley C. Williams]]) and Jenny ([[Ashlynn Yennie]]), two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Dr. Josef Heiter ([[Dieter Laser]]) when they seek help at his house after they get a flat tire. The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". Heiter secures a new male captive, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] tourist Katsuro ([[Akihiro Kitamura]]). The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating [[Siamese twins]], but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-[[anus]], so that they share a single [[Digestion|digestive system]].

After Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter explains that he had previously experimented with creating what he called a "three-dog", also joined mouth-to-anus. However, the three-dog died shortly after surgery. Heiter tells Lindsay that one dog tried to escape and that dog became the middle, thus this caused the most pain to the dog and as punishment for her escape attempt, she will become the middle part of his [[centipede]]. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay in the middle and Jenny at the rear. He removes the front teeth of both women and mutilates the buttocks of both Katsuro and Lindsay in order to provide easier access to the rectums, to which he hideously stitches and grafts their mouths. During his procedure, he severs the ligaments within his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl. He then connects his victims together in a straight line with their mouths surgically attached to the anus of the victim in front of them.

Once the operation is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with [[racism|racist]] insults and beating him with a [[Crop (implement)|crop]] when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro [[Defecation|defecates]], Lindsay is forced to [[Coprophagia|swallow his excrement]] while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from [[Sepsis|septicemia]]. When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the tourists, Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.

Upon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as an injured Heiter hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with a scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house.

For example, because Heiter views the "centipede" as his pet, Laser felt that it was important that Heiter appeared naked during a scene in which he swam in full view of his victims, because Laser said "you aren't ashamed to be naked"<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 56:50â€“57:05</ref> around a pet.

===Writing===
The inspiration for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director [[Tom Six]] once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver.<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, and he began to develop the idea.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 0:25â€“0:47</ref> He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of [[David Cronenberg]] and [[Japanese horror|Japanese horror films]].<ref>Brad Miska.

Six has stated that ''The Human Centipede'' is, to an extent, a reflection on fascism. [[Dieter Laser]], who played the antagonist Dr Heiter, said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations, and that as a German whose father participated in the war, he often felt "like a child whose father is in jail for murder."<ref name="tom six dieter laser DVD Q&A" /> The inclusion of a German villain came from this, with Six citing both the [[German invasion of the Netherlands]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Nazi medical experiments]] as inspiration.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:00â€“1:23</ref> Laser stated in an interview with Clark Collis for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that he considered the film a "grotesque [parody] about the Nazi psyche".<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Heiter's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals, his surname (literally meaning "cheerful" in German) a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter, and his first name coming from [[Josef Mengele]], who carried out [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Medical experiments|experiments on prisoners]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 27:15â€“27:37</ref> World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese.<ref>Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 0:30â€“1:15</ref> Six includes many horror film clichÃ©s in the first act, such as a broken-down car, lack of [[Mobile phone signal|phone signal]]<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 4:15â€“4:40</ref> and very naÃ¯ve victims.<ref name="paste magazine tom six interview"/> Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film, therefore making Dr Heiter's treatment of his victims more shocking.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 5:30â€“6:08</ref>

Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede to create a [[language barrier]] between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film.<ref>Brad Miska, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 9:17â€“9:36</ref> Six stated in the director's commentary for ''The Human Centipede'' that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his "own nightmare."<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 30:32â€“30:53</ref>

While seeking funding for the film, Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together.<ref name="ReferenceA">Brad Miska, Tom Six Answers Your Questions, 1:20â€“1:48</ref>  He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 1:55â€“2:01</ref> His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed.<ref name = "entertainment weekly tom six interview" /> Six claimed that they were very happy with the finished film.<ref>Berge Garabedian, Sitges 09 Interview, 2:00â€“2:10</ref> Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the [[storyboard]] rather than a complete script. They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-Williams" />

===Filming===
Although ''The Human Centipede'' is set in Germany, [[principal photography]] took place in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 0:45â€“0:53</ref> Heiter's home, where most of ''The Human Centipede'' takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 12:03â€“12:24</ref> Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre,<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 17:50â€“18:15</ref> with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 21:40â€“21:48</ref> The paintings of [[conjoined twins]] that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 15:10â€“15:43</ref> The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near [[Amsterdam]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 3:30â€“3:40</ref> The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film.<ref name = "BloodyDisgusting-Yennie"/> The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot on the last day of filming.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 2:29â€“2:35</ref>

Laser remained in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting at the rest of the cast on set,<ref name = "24xps Akihiro Kitamura interview" /> but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation.<ref>Dan Persons.

For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser.<ref name = "24xps Akihiro Kitamura interview" /> During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 53:15â€“53:48</ref> Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 20:09â€“20:27</ref>

The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is "training" his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, in much the same way as music was sometimes played in [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref>Tom Six, ''Director's Commentary'', 51:20â€“51:41</ref> Many of the sound effects in ''The Human Centipede'' were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat.<ref name="The Human Centipede DVD foley session" /> Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming.<ref>Dan Persons, Mighty Movie Podcast, 15:30â€“15:40</ref> Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a [[Bit (horse)|bit]] in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.<ref>Stuart O'Connor, FrightFest Interview, 2:33â€“2:53</ref>

==Reception==
===Critical response===
''The Human Centipede'' received mixed reviews.<ref name = "human centipede 3tv news banned" /> [[Review aggregator]] web site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a 49% approval rating, based upon 91 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10; the general consensus states: "Grotesque, visceral and hard to (ahem) swallow, this surgical horror doesn't quite earn its stripes because the gross-outs overwhelm and devalue everything else."<ref name = "rotten tomatoes thc review" /> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 33 based on 15 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref name = "metacritic human centipede" />

Giving the film three stars out of five, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' writer Kim Newman stated that "underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie."<ref name = "human centipede empire review" /> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]]'' writer Peter DeBurge <!-- Please note this article is in British English -->criticised the film's lack of any form of social commentary, stating that it could not "be bothered to expand upon its unpleasant premise, inviting audiences to revel in its sick humor by favoring Dr. Heiter ... and characterizing the victims as shallow expendables."<ref name = "variety human centipede review" /> Writing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser's performance as the Doctor, and praised Six's direction, saying Six "has put together his nightmare yarn with [[David Cronenberg|Cronenbergian]] care and precision."<ref name = "Entertainment Weekly human centipede review" /> Collis said ''The Human Centipede'' was "without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made."<ref name = "Entertainment Weekly human centipede review" /> Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Peter Bradshaw]] gave the film three out of five, saying that whilst "entirely deplorable and revolting" the film was "sort of brilliant".<ref name = "guardian film human centipede review" /> ''[[Total Film]]'' writer Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five, calling it "Shocking, funny, disturbing... a throwback to the glory days of Cronenberg."<ref name = "Total Film - Human Centipede Review" />

Sukhdev Sandhu of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was generally negative about the film, stating, "''The Human Centipede'' has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen holes in the plot as well as by reams of exposition"<ref name = "The Human Centipede - Daily telegraph Review" /> and that it was "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves."<ref name = "The Human Centipede - Daily telegraph Review" /> ''[[The New York Times]]'' review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint."<ref name = "new york times human centipede review" /> Writing in the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine."<ref name = "ebert chicago sun times review" />

Critics and a doctor have dismissed Six's claim that the film was "100 percent medically accurate" as "ludicrous"<ref name = "Film-Threat editor says film's concept ludicrous" /> and "rubbish".<ref>David Farrier. [http://www.3news.co.nz/Full-interview-with-Human-Centipede-doctor/tabid/312/articleID/173793/Default.aspx "Full interview with Human Centipede doctor â€“ Video"]. ''[[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]]''. [[MediaWorks New Zealand]]. Event occurs at 0:03â€“0:07. Retrieved 5 September 2010.</ref> Dr John Cameron, speaking to [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] News in [[New Zealand]] gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede, stating how he believed it would be difficult for a join between different people to heal and form a connection, and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition.<ref>David Farrier, Full Interview with Human Centipede doctor, 1:11â€“1:51</ref> John Martin, a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas]] said Six's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention. Martin compared Six's claims to those of [[Kroger Babb]] and [[William Castle]] who had also made "grand promises" about what they were putting on screen in a bid to lure audiences.<ref name = "Film-Threat editor says film's concept ludicrous" />

===Accolades===
Despite mixed reviews, the film won several awards in 2009 during advance screenings at various international horror film festivals, including Best Picture/Movie at [[Fantastic Fest]] ([[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas), [[Screamfest Horror Film Festival]] (Los Angeles), and the Sainte Maxime International Horror Film Festival.<ref name = "human centipede production notes" /> Laser won Best Actor in the horror category at Fantastic Fest and the film won the award for Best Ensemble Cast at the South African Horrorfest Film Festival.<ref name = "human centipede production notes" />

[[File:Human_Centipede_movie_centipede.jpg|thumb|right|Each film or "sequence" in the ''Human Centipede'' franchise acts as both a standalone project and as a segment in a larger 4.5 hour film, with the trilogy serving as a 'Movie Centipede'.]]
When Tom Six began creating the ''Human Centipede'' sequels, he envisioned a trilogy that works as a "movie centipede". Each sequel opens with the ending of the previous film, as the events of that film influence said sequel. Although every film works as a standalone movie, they can all be connected to form a single 4.5 hour-long film.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.sixentertainmentcompany.com/tom-six | title = Tom Six| work=Six Entertainment Company| publisher=Six Entertainment Company | author= | date =  | accessdate = 7 Sep 2016}}</ref><ref name="Starburst Interview">{{cite web| url = https://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/tom-six-interview| title = Tom Six - THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE III (FINAL SEQUENCE)| work = Martin Unsworth| publisher = Starburst Magazine| author = Martin Unsworth| date = | accessdate = 7 Sep 2016| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170510074129/http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/12215-tom-six-interview%7C| archivedate = 10 May 2017| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

While promoting ''The Human Centipede'', Six stated that he had started work on a [[sequel]] to ''First Sequence'', titled ''[[The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)]]''. Shooting on a similar budget to the first film,<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:45â€“10:53</ref> Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic and disturbing film; ''First Sequence'' being "''[[My Little Pony]]'' compared with part two."<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:35â€“10:45</ref> Yennie stated at the May 2010 [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors|Weekend of Horrors]] that the sequel would contain "the blood and shit"<ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010 2" /> that viewers did not see in the first film.<ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010 2" /> The plot of ''Full Sequence'' involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast and was given the tag-line ''"100% medically inaccurate"''.<ref>Jason Solomons, Film Weekly... 10:10â€“10:30</ref>

The plot of ''Full Sequence'' involves a man who after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of ''First Sequence'' decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was "sexually violent and potentially obscene".<ref name = "Total Film - Human Centipede II banned" /> The BBFC's report <!-- Please note this article is in British English -->criticised the film as making "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as for the pleasure of the audience"<ref name = "BBFC banning thc2 press release" /> and that the film was potentially in breach of the [[Obscene Publications Act]], meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal.<ref name = "BBFC banning thc2 press release" /> Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]] in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version.<ref name = "guardian thc2 no longer banned" />

The third and final film in the trilogy, ''The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)'', received a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/12215-tom-six-interview%7C | title =Human Centipede Part 3: Exclusive release date and synopsis details | work =Clark Collis | publisher =Entertainment Weekly | author =Mark Collis | date = | accessdate =7 Sep 2016 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170510074129/http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/12215-tom-six-interview%7C | archivedate =10 May 2017 | df =dmy-all }}</ref> as Six says "each film is a reaction to the other.

And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself."<ref name="Starburst Interview" /> As ''Full Sequence'' was intended to make ''First Sequence'' look like ''My Little Pony'' in comparison, ''Final Sequence'' was intended to make ''Full Sequence'' resemble a [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/tom-six-talks-human-centipede-3/ | title = Tom Six Talks The Human Centipede 3 |work=Phil De Semlyen | publisher=Empire | author= Phil De Semlyen | date =  | accessdate = 7 Sep 2016}}</ref> The movie features the tag-line ''"100% Politically Incorrect"''.
