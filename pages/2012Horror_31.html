'''''The Bay''''' is a 2012 American [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and written by Michael Wallach. It premiered at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in theaters on November 2, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2012/09/13/tiff_2012_barry_levinsons_the_bay_at_midnight_madness_diaries.html |title=TIFF 2012: Barry Levinson’s The Bay at Midnight Madness Diaries |last=Wong |first=Tom |date=September 13, 2012 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=69475 |title=The Bay Trailer, News, Videos, and Reviews |work=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Plot==
The movie explains the footage was confiscated by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] until an anonymous source leaked the footage for the entire world to see.

On [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]], 2009, a seaside [[Chesapeake Bay]] town nestled on [[Maryland]]'s [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] thrives on water. When two researchers find a staggering level of toxicity in the water, they attempt to alert the mayor, but he refuses to take action fearing that he will create a panic. As a result, a deadly plague is unleashed, turning humans into hosts for a deadly, mutant breed of the isopod parasite ''[[Cymothoa exigua]]''.

The entire town is overwhelmed by chaos as these aggressive creatures start infecting the people one by one. This spins off into several stories. The most prominent is that of a young inexperienced news reporter and her cameraman, who are in the town to report on the [[American Independence Day|4th of July]] festivities. She also explains the occurrences as the movie proceeds in an off-scene personal recording. The other stories include two [[Oceanography|oceanographers]] who first discovered the parasites; two on-duty police deputies investigating a residential area; a young unsuspecting couple taking a last swim; a teenage girl using [[FaceTime]] to send a desperate message to a friend; a doctor who informs the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] about the developing situation at the local hospital; and, among others, a young married couple with an infant aboard a vessel who sail towards their family's home to reunite for the holidays, unaware of the horrific events unfolding on the mainland.

==Production==

The film came about as a result of a documentary Levinson was asked to produce about problems facing the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name="Wiredskype">{{cite web|last1=Watercutter|first1=Angela|title=The Bay Spikes Cellphone Footage With Environmental Horror|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/11/barry-levinson-the-bay/|website=Wired|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref> Although Levinson chose to abandon the documentary upon learning that ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' already covered the same issue, Levinson instead decided to use the research to produce a horror film which he hoped would shed light on the issues facing Chesapeake.<ref name="Wiredskype"/> As such when promoting the film he noted that it's "80 percent factual information."<ref name="Yahoo"/>

Levinson chose to use the [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] format after thinking about the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Pompeii disaster]]<ref name="Wiredskype"/> and noting that if such a disaster happened today there would be much more evidence of what happened with him telling [[Yahoo!]] "For the very first time in history, you can get a picture of that town, if you collect all the footage from everyone's cell phones and their digital cameras and the Skypes, and the texting and everything else"<ref name="Yahoo">{{cite web|last1=Crow|first1=Jonathan|title=Barry Levinson on his environmental horror movie ‘The Bay’ – 80 percent of this is true|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/barry-levinson-environmental-horror-movie-bay-80-percent-213841481.html|website=Yahoo!|accessdate=21 February 2017}}</ref> A byproduct of the format was that much of the footage was able to be shot by the actors themselves as opposed to a more traditional camera crew. According to Levinson roughly one third of the film was shot this way.<ref name="Wiredskype"/>

Though the film is set in Levinson's home state of Maryland, it was shot on locations in North Carolina and South Carolina.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 77% "certified fresh" approval rating and an average rating of 6.6 out of 10 on [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 70 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_bay_2012/ |title=The Bay (2012) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref> The website's critical consensus states that "Barry Levinson's eco-horror flick cleverly utilizes familiar found-footage methods in service of a gruesome yet atmospheric chiller." It also holds a score of 65 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 20 reviewers, indicating "generally favourable reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-bay |title=The Bay |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref> David Cox of ''[[The Guardian]]'' awarded the film 5 out of 5 stars and called it a "horror film for grown ups".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/28/the-bay-review |title=The Bay – review |last=Cox |first=David |date=February 28, 2013 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref> Roger Ebert of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', however, was less positive, awarding the film 2.5 out of a possible 4, stating "Although there are some scary moments here, and a lot of gruesome ones, this isn't a horror film so much as a faux eco-documentary".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-bay-2012 |title=The Bay Movie Review & Film Summary (2012) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=November 7, 2012 |work=RogerEbert.com |accessdate=June 30, 2014}}</ref>
