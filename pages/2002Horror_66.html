Somewhere in [[Russia]],  [[US Army]] Colonel Robert Evans Jefferson, Jr ([[Marcus Aurelius]]) has been tasked to lead some Russian soldiers commanded by Sergeant Ivan Petrov (Unknown actor) on a secret mission to capture an 80-foot python that was created by American scientists and has gotten loose near the Ural mountains, not long ago, Colonel Jefferson and Sergeant Petrov, accomplish their assigned task and the snakes are placed aboard an American cargo plane heading for the United States, Unfortunately, Chechen rebels mistake the plane for a Russian one and they shoot it down, This alerts a Russian Army unit nearby who then attack the rebels and subsequently take the mysterious contain back to a nearby base. However, the creature escapes, and slaughters all the soldiers and scientists. The only survivor is the Commander of the Russian military base, Colonel Zubov ([[Ivaylo Geraskov]]).

American Dwight Stoddard ([[Dana Ashbrook]]) and his Russian wife, Nalia ([[Simmone Jade Mackinnon]],) run a shipping business in Russia. Greg Larson ([[Billy Zabka]], reprising his role from ''Python'') hires them to move some mysterious container, which is holding another larger python, and they reach the isolated and deserted Russian military base where they discover Zubov. Larson's primary concern is retrieving the snakes' [[DNA]], and he begins to kill his own men in the attempt. After being discovered about his true intentions by Dwight and Nalia, Larson engages Dwight in a fist fight. During the fight, Larson gets suffocated by the first snake and dies while begging for help. The snake is killed when an explosive is hurled into its mouth by Dwight, while the other snake chases Dwight and Nalia through a [[land mine]] field and gets itself blown up by the explosives. Dwight and Nalia survive, and are rescued by Russian soldiers.
