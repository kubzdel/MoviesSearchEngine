'''''The Grudge 3''''' is a 2009 American [[supernatural horror film]] and the third and final installment in [[The Grudge (film series)|''The Grudge'' trilogy]]. [[Toby Wilkins]], who had previously directed the successful film ''[[Splinter (2008 film)|Splinter]]'' and the short film series ''[[The Grudge 2#Release|Tales from the Grudge]]'', took [[Takashi Shimizu]]'s place as director who later served as executive producer, while Brad Keene replaced [[Stephen Susco]] as screenwriter. The film stars [[Johanna Braddy]], [[Gil McKinney]] and [[Shawnee Smith]], with a special appearance by [[Matthew Knight]] (from ''[[The Grudge 2]]''), and was released on DVD on May 12, 2009.

Unlike the previous American films that were both rated PG-13, ''The Grudge 3'' was given an R rating because of its graphic bloody violence, gore and language. The film features a linear plotline unlike all of its predecessors, which used nonlinear sequences of events for their respective plots and subplots.

==Plot==
Jake Kimble (the only survivor from the second film) is under the care of Dr. Francine Sullivan in an asylum. He is locked in his room following several escape attempts and is attacked by Kayako. The attack is seen on security cameras, although Kayako cannot be seen, and Jake is dead by the time Sullivan arrives with a security officer. News of the incident reaches a young woman in Tokyo, Naoko, who is the sister of Kayako. Believing that her sister is responsible, she travels to Chicago.
 
The apartment building where Jake lived is under renovation. Of the few residents who remain, some glimpse Toshio. One is drowned by [[Takeo Saeki]] and is never again seen. Sullivan, while investigating Jake's death, speaks with residents and finds that others have seen the little boy of whom Jake spoke. Sullivan digs more into the information and is killed by Kayako.

Naoko moves in as attacks continue against the residents and anyone associated with them. She tells the landlord's family that the curse now resides in the apartment and tries to convince them to participate in an exorcism. The landlord's sister, Lisa Morrison, refuses to cooperate but reconsiders when she realizes that her brother, Max, is possessed by the spirit of Takeo Saeki, the evil husband of Kayako and the source of the curse. Naoko warns that the ceremony must not be interrupted and tells Rose that she must drink Kayako's blood. Lisa disallows this. Takeo, as Max, realizes what Naoko is attempting and attacks and kills her. Lisa is chased by Kayako until, just as Kayako is about to kill Lisa, Rose drinks Kayako's blood which causes her curse to disappear.

Max returns to his senses and sobs over what he has done, but Naoko's murder has (frustratingly) begun a new curse. Her ghost attacks and kills him. The film ends with Kayako shown to be in possession of Rose.

==Production==
During [[post-production]] of ''The Grudge 2'', [[Takashi Shimizu]] discussed ideas of creating another sequel, saying: "During the script meeting, Our ideas didn't go anywhere good, and we couldn't come up with anything interesting to stop the curse, so if that's the case, I would rather just go for something that could never be stopped. But who knows, maybe something can be stopped in ''The Grudge 3''."<ref>{{cite web | author= Coming Soon| date=October 5, 2006| title= Grudge 3 ideas| work= Coming Soon| url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/grudgenews.php?id=14055

==Reception==
Critical reaction to ''The Grudge 3'' was generally mixed to negative.
