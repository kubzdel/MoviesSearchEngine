'''''Troublesome Night 7''''' is a 2000 Hong Kong horror comedy film produced and directed by Nam Yin. It is the seventh of the 19 films in the ''Troublesome Night'' film series.

==Plot==
A film crew travels to a remote island to shoot a music video. The island is inhabited by some villagers and an eccentric police detective. Paranormal events occur during their stay: eerie screams are heard at night but the villagers dismiss them as wolves' howling; a strange young man is seen wandering around, asking whether they had seen someone called Ying. In addition, while shooting a scene in the water, the actresses felt something tickling their feet. An old woman narrates a tragic story about a pair of lovers from the village who were separated from each other because the woman's father opposed the relationship — the man was burnt to death while the woman drowned herself at sea. A mysterious [[feral child]] is revealed to be the one responsible for making the screams, and the old woman recognises him as the lovers' long-lost son. A ritual is performed to put the lovers' spirits to rest and their son is adopted by the villagers.
