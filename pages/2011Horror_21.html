The film was designed not to be hostile to religion but critical of aspects.  Chando was cast due to her ability to portray character Gloria's sullen disposition using few spoken lines.  In other to get into the character, Gelatt provided Chando with dark, atmospheric music, such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[The Cure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/24708/tribeca-11-the-bleeding-house-review-interview/|title=Tribeca '11: 'The Bleeding House' Review, Interview|last=Marrone|first=John|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2011-05-24|accessdate=2014-09-17}}</ref>
