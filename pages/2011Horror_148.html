{{Nihongo|'''''Schoolgirl Apocalypse'''''|セーラー服黙示録|Sērā-fuku mokushiroku|"[[Sailor suit]] Apocalypse"}} is a 2011 Japanese [[zombie film]] written and directed by John Cairns, as his first feature film.<ref name=djuna/> The film screened at [[Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival]] and the [[Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan]] in 2011 and the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal in 2012.

==Plot==
When all the men in her small town turn into zombies and begin to attack the women, Japanese schoolgirl Sakura ([[Rino Higa|Higarino]]) finds her life turned upside down. The trauma of witnessing the mass murder of her female friends and family members pushes her toward madness.

Having few skills and armed only with her English textbook and a ''[[kyūdō]]'' bow, she sets out to survive. Having visions of a red-headed boy named Billy (Max MacKenzie), a character from one of her books, drives her toward insanity and she begins to lose her grip on reality. She wanders about, narrowly escaping her own death, until she finds Aoi (Mai Tsujimoto), a woman who is both equipped and mentally ready to kill. But this woman is dangerous and, rather than support, offers violence and more punishment. Seeking the real-life version of Billy, Sakura must decide whether to survive and find the answers or give up and die.<ref group="note">Some text adapted from the [http://www.schoolgirlapocalypse.com Schoolgirl Apocalypse website], released under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License</ref>

==Reception==
''L'Écran Fantastique'' described ''Schoolgirl Apocalypse'' as an "alternative" zombie film. "A skillful and effective road movie at the intersection of ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[The Road]]''...a great surprise sure to delight alternative zombie movie fans."<ref name="L'Écran Fantastique">{{cite news|last=Lehmann |first=Olivier |format=photobucket archive |title=Schoolgirl Apocolypse|url=http://s1157.photobucket.com/albums/p594/MrDOBDOB/ |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |newspaper=L'Écran Fantastique|date=December 2011 |page=111}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}

The film was also described as genre-changing by the [[Germany|German]] online film review magazine ''Manifest''. They stated that it is daring for an American film director to use exaggerated western clichés for a Japanese horror-genre film. They called the film "a liberating 'fuck you', a surprisingly serious and decelerated undead Armageddon."<ref name="Manifest"/> Sound design was favorably compared to ''[[Poltergeist II: The Other Side|Poltergist II]]'', but they faulted the director for his restrained gore. They also stated that while the project was filmed in rural areas near [[Mount Fuji]], the famous landmark did not appear in the film, which was an intentional choice by the director to avoid clichés. They concluded by stating that while the film had too little action and no blood, it was a good movie, and rated it 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name="Manifest">{{cite web|last=Karenovics|first=Alexander |language=German|title=SCHOOLGIRL APOCALYPSE (Japan 2011)|url=http://www.dasmanifest.com/04/japanfilmfesthamburg2012.php#5|date=May 28, 2012|work=Manifest - Das Filmmagazin|accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref>

''News-Gate'' wrote that an important criterion for a successful horror film would include "savage monsters and beautiful heroine,"<ref name="News-Gate"/> and that the film's plot of heroine and boy versus an epidemic was taken from a comic book by [[Tomohiro Koizumi]].<ref name=News-Gate>{{cite news|script-title=ja:黒髪＆おでこフェチ必見！ 2012年期待の美少女ヒガリノって？|url=http://www.news-gate.jp/2012/0208/30/|accessdate=July 6, 2012|newspaper=News-Gate|date=February 8, 2012|language=Japanese}}</ref>

''Djuna'' noted that this was director John Cairns' first feature film, and developed in 2010 through support of the Network of Asian Fantastic Films (NAFF). They wrote that the film's beginning and title might lead viewers to feel the film was to be simply a "Japanese schoolgirls killing zombies" film, but it took off in an unexpected direction. They also noted that the film was a bit garbled, the political metaphors were too strong, and it did not contain as much action as might have been expected. Overall, the response was positive, and they rated the film 2 stars out of 3.<ref name=djuna>{{cite news|language=Korean|title=세라복 묵시록 Sêrâ-fuku mokushiroku (2011)|url=http://djuna.cine21.com/xe/2585889|accessdate=July 7, 2012|newspaper=Djuna|date=July 21, 2011}}</ref>
