Of the film, Hill stated that he was inspired to create ''Scream Park'' after visiting a theme park and thinking that it would be a good location for an 80's themed horror film.

==Synopsis==
Jennifer (Wendy Wygant) works at Fright Land, a theme park that's closing after years of declining sales and lack of interest from the general public. While initially reluctant, Jennifer agrees to attend a party held by the other park employees to memorialize the park's closing. She can't help but feel that something feels off about the night's events and her suspicions are soon proven to be correct, as park owner Mr. Hyde ([[Doug Bradley]]) has decided that the only way to save the park is to hire two men to murder all of the park's employees. He theorizes that after the killers complete their task, morbid murder fans will pay large amounts of money to visit an amusement park themed around the murders.
