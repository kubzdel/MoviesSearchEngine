''Resident Evil: Retribution'' is a direct [[sequel]] to the previous film ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'', and focuses on [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] ([[Milla Jovovich]]) captured by the [[Umbrella Corporation]], forcing her to make her escape from an underwater facility in the [[Extreme North]], used for testing the T-virus. The film has many returning actors and characters, along with new characters from the video games not featured in the previous films. Filming took place from October to December 2011 for an international release date of September 14, 2012.<ref name="sept14"/>

The film was released in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], and [[IMAX 3D]]<ref name="Plot">{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/121/1216176p1.html|title=Resident Evil: Retribution Title Tweak|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 9, 2012|accessdate=January 9, 2012}}</ref> to a box-office success, grossing over $240 million worldwide. [[Film critics]] criticized the film for its characters, plot, and acting while praising the 3D, visual effects, and [[stage combat|fight choreography]]. The [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[DVD]] for the film was released on December 21, 2012.

==Plot==
Alice and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter ''Arcadia'', now face an attack by an assaulting fleet of tiltrotor [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Ospreys]] led by Alice's former ally, [[Jill Valentine]], resulting in the killing of many of the survivors in the ship. Alice is captured during the attack while the fates of [[Chris Redfield]], [[Claire Redfield]] and K-Mart are left ambiguous.

The story switches to a suburban Alice living with her husband, Todd, and her deaf daughter Becky. Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia was actually Raccoon City during the contamination incident. Alice and Becky manage to run away from the undead, with the help of Rain Ocampo, by letting them ride in her car. As the three escape, they are hit by a garbage truck, knocking Rain unconscious. Alice hides Becky, but is killed by a zombified Todd.

Meanwhile, the real Alice awakens in an underground facility and is interrogated by Jill. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell and the laser grid, finding herself in a simulation of Shibuya Square, [[Tokyo]]. Fighting her way out against zombies, she enters a control room filled with dead Umbrella employees and encounters [[Ada Wong]], one of [[Albert Wesker]]'s top agents. Wesker appears on a screen, explaining that they no longer serve Umbrella and the power outage was staged by Wesker's hacking into the facility's computer mainframe. Wesker also reveals that the Red Queen, one of Alice's arch-enemies, was reactivated after the Hive incident and now controls Umbrella. He furthermore explains that the facility is underwater, located in [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka, Russia]], and that it formerly served as a Soviet naval outpost.

The facility was designed by Umbrella for manufacturing clones and creating simulated outbreaks to show the effect of the T-virus. Ada and Alice plan to rendezvous with a rescue crew organized by Wesker, which includes Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton, and Luther West (Alice's former ally, who survived after [[Resident Evil: Afterlife|the outbreak in Los Angeles]]). Leon's team plants explosives near the entrance of the facility, which will detonate in two hours to ensure the facility's destruction. The group plans to meet with Alice and Ada in the Raccoon City suburbia area. In a [[New York City]] simulation, Alice and Ada defeat two Executioners. Leon and his team enter a [[Moscow]] simulation ([[Red Square]] in front of the [[GUM (department store)|GUM]] façade), but they are cut off by a heavily armed Las Plagas undead horde, which has surrounded them.

In the Suburban setting, Alice and Ada encounter Becky, who mistakes Alice for her clone mother, and is instantly attached to her. They also encounter the clones, which consists of Alice's deceased allies; James "One" Shade, "evil" Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera, who are sent to capture them. During the shootout which was triggered by Ada, she gives Alice her smart glasses and her grappling hook so that she and Becky can find their way out, and they become separated. They encounter the "good" clone of Rain (who they met in Suburbia at the beginning) in the Moscow simulation (''[[Arbatskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Arbatskaya]]'' metro station), and Alice gives her a weapon. She then rescues Leon's surviving crew from the barrage of Las Plagas zombies and a giant Licker. Once united, the group heads toward the tunnel and reaches the submarine pens in the facility exit, but they are ambushed by Jill's team. Becky is captured by the Licker, and "good" Rain is killed, breaking her neck after being thrown by the Licker. Alice rescues Becky, and also kills the Licker using a belt of grenades she found. Barry sacrifices himself in the process, holding the Umbrella operatives off long enough to ensure the others' escape. Using Leon's bombs, they finally manage to destroy the facility, allowing Leon and Luther to escape, while Alice and Becky also survive, having used the ventilation system.

On the surface, their snowmobile is knocked over by Jill Valentine's Oscar-Class submarine. Jill and "bad" Rain confront the group with Ada being held as their hostage. Jill and Alice begin fighting each other, while Rain – now also enhanced with the Las Plagas parasite, granting her superhuman strength and healing – fights Leon and Luther. Alice is able to tear the mind-controlling scarab off Jill's chest, returning her to her normal self. Unfortunately, Rain also kills Luther in the process, while Leon is knocked out. Realizing that they can't kill Rain, Alice shoots the ice under her feet and she is dragged down by the swimming zombies from the undersea installation to be devoured, killing her for good. Alice, Ada, Becky, Leon, and Jill travel to Wesker's headquarters, a heavily barricaded and fortified [[White House]], staffed by the remainders of the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]]. Alice meets Wesker in the heavily barricaded [[Oval Office]], where he injects her with the T-virus, returning her superhuman abilities; as only Alice successfully bonded with it, she is the ultimate weapon. On the roof, Wesker explains that the Red Queen is trying to wipe out humanity, and all of the remaining uninfected humans are in the base; it is humanity's last stand. A pull-away shows the U.S. Military defending the White House alongside the remaining Umbrella Corp. soldiers against enormous hordes of T-virus abominations swarming all over the walls.

==Production==

===Development===
After the release of ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife]]'', director Paul W. S. Anderson was in discussion with Screen Gems of filming a fifth and sixth film [[back to back film production|back to back]]. But Anderson later decided to just focus on ''Resident Evil: Retribution''.<ref name="collider1" /> Anderson returned as writer and director, Glen McPherson serves as director of photography, Kevin Phipps as [[production designer]],<ref name="sept14" /> and Nick Powell as both a fight choreographer and second-unit director.<ref name="collider1" />

===Influences===
When Ada and Alice encounter each other the first time they recreate a scene from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' in their brief fight. An element from ''Resident Evil 4'', a parasite called Las Plagas plays a part in the film and allows the undead to "run around, ride motorbikes, and shoot machine guns."<ref name="ColliderDetails" /> An action scene inspired by ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'' where the characters are driving a [[Hummer]] while being chased by zombies is featured, but for the film the Hummer was changed to a [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls Royce Phantom]].<ref name="ColliderDetails" /> The metal bug on Jill Valentine's chest can be seen in ''Resident Evil 5''.

Aside from the video games, writing for the film was heavily influenced by science-fiction films. "I think ''[[Inception]]'' had a huge impact on everyone," says Bolt, "and I think ''[[Westworld (film)|Westworld]]'' is an important film to Paul. Everybody knows, because he talks about it enough, the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' series]], ''[[Blade Runner]]'', all these things are inspirations."

Makeup effects supervisor Paul Jones stated that he wanted the makeup on the zombies to look realistic. He took inspiration from [[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|''Day of the Dead'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/resident-evil-5-retribution-set-visit |title=RESIDENT EVIL 5 RETRIBUTION Set Visit |publisher=Collider.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

The film's fight sequences were influenced by [[Asian cinema]]. "We watched a lot of [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] movies this time around because of the movies (Powell) has done," says Anderson. "He did ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' as well. He has worked with a lot of [[Japan]]ese stuntmen and he has worked with a lot of [[Hong Kong]] stuntmen. But we felt the area that hadn't been mined by western cinema much was that whole kind of high impact Thai style of fighting. So we just watched a lot of action sequences from a lot of Thai movies. There were moves and just a general feel that we thought we could infuse the movie with. You know, that kind of bone crunch where you really feel the impact. We tried to bring that into the movie, which is also good for 3D because obviously 3D makes it harder to sell those kind of fake phony punches because you see the distance between the fist and the face. So that kind of Thai style of fighting where you actually make contact is a lot stronger."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/jeremy-bolt-don-carmody-robert-kulzer-resident-evil-5-retribution-interview |title=Producers Jeremy Bolt, Don Carmody, and Robert Kulzer RESIDENT EVIL 5 RETRIBUTION Interview |publisher=Collider.com |date=2012-01-19 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

===Music===
{{Further|Discography of the Resident Evil film series}}
The music group [[Tomandandy]], who performed the ''[[Resident Evil: Afterlife|Afterlife]]'' score, returned to score ''Resident Evil: Retribution''. Anderson explains that the score for this film will be a progression of ''Afterlife'', stating that he "wants to kind of mesh their more electronic stuff with an orchestra this time. It still has that cool Tomandandy feel, but it has a more epic scope to it."<ref name="collider1"/> The official soundtrack was released on September 11, 2012 under [[Milan Records]], which included Tomandandy's score for the film, as well as the film's end credits song "Hexes" produced by [[Bassnectar]] featuring [[Chino Moreno]] (of the [[Deftones]]) on vocals.<ref>{{cite web

A viral website, UmbrellaCorporation.net, supposedly informed about Umbrella, reported that it was on a recruitment tour all over the world searching for "great minds to help them advance". On several occasions, a video of Alice (Milla Jovovich) appeared, telling the viewer not to trust Umbrella. At the same time, an actual mobile tour for the film was launched, travelling to [[Cancún]], [[Barcelona]], [[Poznań]], [[Warsaw]] and [[Rome]]. Furthermore, a black, tinted SUV with the Umbrella Corporation symbol and name on its doors and license plate was seen in Atlanta in June.

A second trailer premiered online on June 14, following a live Q&A with Milla Jovovich in [[New York City]] and was attached to prints of [[That's My Boy (2012 film)|''That's My Boy'']].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.millaj.com/film/resident5.shtml |title=The Official Milla Jovovich Website :: Resident Evil: Retribution (2012) |publisher=MillaJ.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

On August 10, 2012, a group of 27 people dressed as zombies "invaded" the [[Shibuya]] shopping district and handed out leaflets to promote the film. The group marched across the crossing in front of the [[Shibuya Station]] and then moved on to Shibuya's underground shopping area "Shibuchika" and to the "Shibuya Cine Palace".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/08/10-1/resident-evil-retribution-promotion-unleashes-zombie-horde-on-shibuya |title=Resident Evil Retribution Promotion Unleashes Zombie Horde On Shibuya |publisher=Daily Dead |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}</ref>

The film's [[Premiere|world premiere]] took place in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] (where the film was retitled ''Biohazard V: Retribution'') on September 3. Originally, a promotional stunt was planned that involved Jovovich pretending to come out with a gun and shoot "zombies" in the theater. In response to the [[2012 Aurora shooting|Aurora shootings]], Jovovich declined the stunt, commenting that "There's absolutely no way I'm doing anything violent in a movie theater."<ref>{{cite web | date= 2012-09-05 | author= Bruce Fretts | url= http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-09-09/news/33718383_1_movie-theater-zombies-sci-fi-icon | title=Milla Jovovich interview| publisher=NY Daily News | accessdate= 2013-02-01}}</ref> Jovovich, Anderson, and Nakashima appeared at the premiere for a [[Red carpet|red carpet event]].

Li Bingbing did not appear at the premiere, raising speculation from reporters that her absence was a demonstration against the escalating dispute between China and Japan over the [[Senkaku Islands]]. Li's agent Ji Xiang explained that Li had been informed of the premiere two months before but she was too busy in [[Beijing]] to attend at that time. However, Ji did not deny that politics were involved, saying: "We are in line with our government – the Diaoyu Islands belong to [[China]]. Bingbing will be attending movie premieres held in other places across the world and she skipped the Tokyo leg only."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2012-09/04/content_26422514.htm |title=China.org|publisher=China.org|date=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>

===International territories===
''Resident Evil: Retribution'' broke the series record for the highest worldwide opening with $49.6 million, beating out ''Afterlife'''s opening of over $39 million. In its opening weekend, the film was strongest in [[Asia]], where it had the best [[2012 in film|2012]] [[Hollywood]] debut so far in [[Japan]] ($11.2 million), [[Taiwan]] ($4.4 million) and [[Malaysia]] ($2 million). Its premiere in [[South Korea]] ($2 million) was underwhelming, where it underperformed to the local film [[Masquerade (2012 film)|''Masquerade'']] ($7.3 million). Elsewhere, the movie did very good business in [[Russia]] ($8.5 million) and [[Brazil]] ($3.1 million), but was disappointing in [[Australia]] ($1.5 million).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3527&p=.htm |title=''Retribution'' International Opening Weekend |publisher= IDMB |work= [[Box Office Mojo]] |date=2012-10-01|accessdate=2012-10-01}}</ref> The film retained the number one spot in its second weekend, grossing $30.5 million for a new foreign total of $103.8 million.

Worldwide, the film grossed $240 million, after the movie opened in China on 17 March. Although this does not match its predecessor's gross of $296 million, it still ranks as the second highest grossing in the series, the highest grossing foreign film in Japan in 2012 (7th overall), and the highest grossing Canadian film of 2012, and second of all time (behind ''Afterlife'').<ref name="res5bo" />

==Critical reception==
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 30% based on reviews from 67 critics, with an average rating of 4.4 out of 10. The critical consensus on the site is "Resident Evil: Retribution offers everything one might reasonably expect from the fifth installment in a heavily action-dependent franchise – which means very little beyond stylishly hollow CGI-enhanced set pieces".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/resident_evil_retribution/ |title=Resident Evil: Retribution |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= 2013-02-01 }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 39 based on 17 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/resident-evil-retribution/details|title=Resident Evil: Retribution Metacritic rating|publisher= [[CBS]] |work= [[Metacritic]]|accessdate= 2012-09-14}}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Grady|title=Box office report: 'Resident Evil' outswims 'Nemo' with $21.1 million|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/17/showbiz/movies/box-office-master-ew/index.html|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 18, 2012|date=September 17, 2012}}</ref>

Jim Vejvoda at [[IGN]] gave the film a 6 out of 10, saying, "Even with all of its dopey dialogue, wooden characters and 'been there, done that' elements, ''Resident Evil: Retribution'' is pretty amazing as far as entries in this series go. It certainly feels more like a video game and has a bit more emotion to it than some of the past ''Resident Evil'' sequels, but if you don't like this series then there's not much here to make you suddenly warm up to it."<ref>{{cite web | date = September 14, 2012 | author =  Jim Vejvoda| url = http://ign.com/articles/2012/09/14/resident-evil-retribution-3d-review| title = Resident Evil: Retribution 3D Review| publisher = NewsCorp | work = IGN| accessdate = 2013-02-02}}</ref>  Clark Collis from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' also gave the film a mostly positive review, stating that "writer-director W.S. Anderson's overseeing of the ''Resident Evil'' zombie franchise has proven to be both lunatically haphazard and dementedly enthusiastic."<ref>{{cite web| date=2012-09-15 | author= Clark Collis | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20630391,00.html | title=Resident Evil: Retribution Review &#124; Movie Reviews and News | work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher= | accessdate=2012-09-21}}</ref>
