'''''Red State''''' is a 2011 American [[independent film|independent]] [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Kevin Smith]] and starring [[John Goodman]], [[Melissa Leo]] and [[Michael Parks]].

After months of saying that the distribution rights to the film would be auctioned off immediately after the premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], Smith controversially announced that he was instead going to self-distribute the picture under the [[SModcast Pictures]] banner with a traveling show in select cities.

On June 28, 2011, Smith announced a one-week run in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s [[New Beverly Cinema]] (making the film eligible for [[Academy Award]] consideration).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coopersdell.com/ |title=RED STATE - One Week Academy Qualifying Engagement - Aug 19-25 |publisher=Coopersdell.com |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}</ref> The film was released via [[video on demand]] on September 1, 2011 through [[Lionsgate]], in select theaters for a special one-night-only engagement on September 23, 2011 (via [[SModcast Pictures]]), and on home video October 18, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theredstatements.com/2011/09/06/red-state-back-in-theaters-925/ |title=RED STATE back in theaters, 9/25! |publisher=The Red Statements |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2014-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McNary|first=Dave|title='Red State' debuts on VOD before theatrical run|date=August 1, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2011|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118040736|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

==Plot==
{{long plot|date=June 2014}}
Travis ([[Michael Angarano]]) notices a fire station siren being removed from its pole and members of the Five Points Trinity Church, led by Abin Cooper ([[Michael Parks]]), protesting the funeral of a murdered local [[gay]] teenager. Jared ([[Kyle Gallner]]), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman named Sarah Cooper ([[Melissa Leo]]) he met on a sex site for group sex with Travis and Billy Ray ([[Nicholas Braun]]). They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel to meet her. Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan ([[Stephen Root]]), while he was having sex with a man. Afraid, the boys drive off.

Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete ([[Matt L. Jones]]) to go and look for the vehicle. Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the woman's trailer. She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon before identifying another captive, a [[homosexual]] they lured in through an internet chat room. They bind him to a cross using plastic cling wrap, murder him with a [[revolver]] and drop him into a small crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together.

Cooper then begins binding Jared to the cross, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church. Travis and Billy Ray use a protruding bone from the corpse to cut themselves free, which is heard by Caleb ([[Ralph Garman]]). He lifts up the trap door just in time to see Billy Ray escape and runs after him. Billy Ray is not able to help Travis out of his tight cling wrap cuffs and leaves him for dead. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Mordechai ([[James Parks (actor)|James Parks]]). Cooper then blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife using explicit photos the church has taken of him. In desperation, Wynan calls [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] Agent Joseph Keenan ([[John Goodman]]), who begins setting up outside the church.

While the family mourns Caleb, Travis (who had broken free) arms himself and plans to shoot the congregation, but witnesses Jared still being held captive on the cross. Travis makes a run for it, but is mistaken for a congregation member by Wynan and shot. Keenan tries to reason with the family, but ATF Special Agent Brooks ([[Kevin Pollak]]) is shot in the head by Cooper and a shoot-out erupts. In the midst of the shooting, Wynan is killed, and Agent Keenan receives a call from ATF higher-ups ordering him to stage a full [[Raid (military)|raid]] on the complex to ensure that no witnesses remain.  Keenan is clearly disturbed by this, but passes on the order to another tactical agent, named Harry ([[Kevin Alejandro]]), who also struggles with this decision and argues with Keenan. Keenan dismisses Harry's protests for personal reasons, rationalizing his decision based on personal gain and the reputation of the ATF. Harry storms off in disgust.

During the shoot-out, Cheyenne ([[Kerry Bishé]]) escapes and is captured by an ATF agent ([[Marc Blucas]]). Just as the ATF agent is about to shoot her, he is killed by Sarah. Cheyenne returns to the house and unbinds Jared, begging him to help her hide the congregation's children. Jared refuses and her pleas turn into a fight. Sarah notices them and attacks Jared. Cheyenne tries to break up the fight and accidentally shoots Sarah in the process, killing her. Cheyenne sends the children up into the attic, and Jared changes his mind and decides to help Cheyenne hide the children. They run outside to plead with Keenan to spare the children but are killed by Harry.

The shoot-out is interrupted by a mysterious trumpet blast.  The remaining Coopers lower their weapons and run outside rejoicing, claiming that "the [[Rapture]]" has come upon them. Abin calmly approaches a stunned ATF team and confidently taunts them that God's wrath is upon the Earth. He raises his arms and stands in the face of a confused and worried Keenan in a moment of triumph, daring him to defy God.

Several days later, during a briefing before high-ranking government officials, Keenan reports that he then head-butted Cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. He explains that the trumpet noises were not the Rapture but came from a group of college students who lived down the road and were irritated with Cooper. As a prank they rigged up an old fire house siren to an [[iPod]] with loud trumpet noises, unaware of the shootout taking place over the hill. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors at the time to kill everyone at the compound.

Keenan is surprised that he is not punished for his actions but his superiors explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was mostly personal and that they are satisfied with the alternative punishment of taking away the prisoners' constitutional rights to [[due process]] by classifying their crimes as terrorism and locking them up without ever letting them go to trial. Keenan laments this outcome in a story he shares about a couple of hungry brawling dogs he once knew that taught him about the darker side of human nature and the way simple beliefs can turn humans into bloodthirsty animals.

Cooper is finally seen pacing around his cell singing and sermonizing to himself until another prisoner ([[Kevin Smith]]) tells him to "shut the f*** up".

===Original ending===
During various interactive Q&As for the film, Smith has stated that the original ending continued with the  [[Rapture]] happening and the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] descending on the scene.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venkman|title=RT-UK Exclusive: Kevin Smith's Horror Project Revealed|publisher=Geekly Rant|date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=January 25, 2011|url=http://geektyrant.com/news/2011/1/26/sundance-2011-kevin-smiths-red-state-qa-reveals-his-original.html}}</ref>

==Production==
Kevin Smith announced at the [[Wizard World|Wizard World Chicago]] 2006 convention that his next project would move in a different direction, and it would be a straight horror film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Kevin Smith Announces Horror Film |publisher=[[/Film]] |date=August 7, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20060807kevin-smith-horror-film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023220054/http://www.slashfilm.com/article.php/20060807kevin-smith-horror-film |archivedate=October 23, 2010 |df= }}</ref> In April 2007, Smith revealed the title of the movie to be ''Red State'' and said that it was inspired by infamous pastor [[Fred Phelps]], or as Smith claimed, "very much about that subject matter, that point of view and that position taken to the absolute [[extremism|extreme]]. It is certainly not Phelps himself but it's very much inspired by a Phelps (like) figure."<ref>{{cite web|last=Utichi|first=Joe|title=RT-UK Exclusive: Kevin Smith's Horror Project Revealed |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=April 6, 2007|accessdate=August 5, 2011|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/rtuk-exclusive-kevin-smiths-horror-project-revealed/}}</ref> The first draft was finished in August 2007 with Smith wanting to film it before ''[[Zack and Miri Make a Porno]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Kevin Smith comments on Rosario skipping "Zack and Miri"|publisher=filmsy|accessdate=August 5, 2011|url=http://www.filmsy.com/reviews/kevin-smith-comments-on-rosario-skipping-zak-and-miri/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Peter|first=Sciretta|title=Kevin Smith Finishes Red State Screenplay|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=August 29, 2007|accessdate=August 5, 2011|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/08/29/kevin-smith-finishes-red-state-screenplay}}</ref> Setting it apart from the majority of his other films, Smith made it clear that ''Red State'' was a horror film, stating that there would be no [[toilet humor]] in the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kevin Smith's Twitter feed |publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=January 2, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2011|url=https://www.twitter.com/ThatKevinSmith/statuses/21474291107237888}}</ref>

While speaking at a Q&A event in [[London]] on October 13, 2009, Smith stated that funding had been secured for ''Red State'' but that he wanted to proceed with ''Hit Somebody'' and delay filming ''Red State'' for a year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title=Kevin Smith Finds Funding For Red State?

In July 2010, Smith stated on his [[Twitter]] account that "God-willing, [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] in Jan for RED STATE." On November 8, Smith announced on Twitter that the movie was viewed by Sundance, to determine if it was eligible for entry in the 2011 festival.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ThatKevinSmith|author=KevinSmith|number=1708255030026240|date=8 November 2010|title=Via @tbylckwd "When will you hear from Sundance about Redstate?"

In the "Commercial" episode of ''[[Comic Book Men]]'', Smith cited [[Bryan Johnson (filmmaker)|Bryan Johnson]]'s film ''[[Vulgar (film)|Vulgar]]'' as being an inspiration for ''Red State''.

==Marketing and distribution==
{{rquote|right|"...soon after the film played to a good but not great reaction in its world premiere, Smith ditched the idea of a public sale and announced to the audience (after auctioning the film to himself for $20) that he would release the film on his own in October."|3=Reporter John Horn, observer at the live-auction<ref name="latimes1">{{cite news|last=Horn |first=John |title=Sundance 2011: Kevin Smith takes ''Red State'' into his own hands |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=January 23, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/01/sundance-2011-kevin-smith-takes-red-state-into-his-own-hands.html}}</ref>}}
Throughout the months of November and December, teaser posters were released featuring characters from the movie in auctions via his Twitter account with the winning bidder hosting the poster exclusively on their website, while the money raised by the auction went to charity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=29771 |title=Two New Red State Posters Pushed Online |date=December 20, 2010 |work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]] |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref> Smith released a teaser trailer for the film on December 23, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/12/red_state_trailer_kevin_smith.html |title=Red State Trailer: Kevin Smith Gets Terrifying |date=December 23, 2010 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |publisher=New York Media Holdings |accessdate=December 24, 2010}}</ref>

Although Smith had announced plans to auction off the rights to ''Red State'' to distributors attending his [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] screening of the film, he revealed that was merely a ploy and Smith planned to self-distribute as a traveling roadshow beginning March 5 at [[Radio City Music Hall]], and would tour the film across North America before releasing ''Red State'' directly to DVD and VOD.<ref>{{cite web|title=Update: Kevin Smith to Self-Distribute Red State |website=Shock Till You Drop |date=January 23, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/articlenews.php?id=17843}}</ref>

{{rquote|right|...to hear Smith dismiss the idea of "selling [the movie] to some jackass," neither the rant nor the phony auction was amusing. It seemed Smith had poured a liberal dose of gasoline on a pile of indie-film relationships and lit a match, and some observers took it as a sign that Smith might finally be imploding.|3=Kim Masters, on the auction controversy<ref name="hollywoodreporter1">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kevin-smith-alarmist-ninnies-misinterpreted-95811 |title=Kevin Smith: "Alarmist Ninnies" Misinterpreted Sundance Outburst |first=Kim |last=Masters |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>}}

===Auction controversy===
Controversy soon erupted after Smith's speech at the film's debut screening at Sundance. Although Smith had decided to self-distribute the film, according to the film's producer Jonathan Gordon the option of self-distributing the movie was not considered at first:<blockquote>Hiring longtime specialty exec Dinerstein (whose film marketing consultancy also arranges self-distribution deals), bringing aboard Cinetic Media (which arranged service deals for sale titles like last year's Banksy doc "Exit Through the Gift Shop") with co-seller WME, and slapping the word "March" at the end of the teaser trailer has led many to suspect Smith has a self-distribution backup plan should an attractive offer fail to materialize. But is self-distribution or a service deal even an option they're considering? "No," says Gordon. "We want to have someone who loves the movie, understands it, knows how to handle it and get the most out of it."<ref name="variety1" /></blockquote>

The sudden announcement of self-distribution after initially announcing an auction provoked a backlash from the media and accusations of dishonesty,<ref name="hitfix1">{{cite web|last=McWeeny |first=Drew |title=Sundance review: Kevin Smith's ''Red State'' fails onscreen and off at its world premiere |publisher=Hitfix |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/sundance-review-kevin-smiths-red-state-fails-onscreen-and-off-at-its-world-premiere}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|first=Josh |last=Wigler |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2011/02/09/kevin-smith-red-state-sundance/ |title=Kevin Smith On ''Red State'' Sundance Controversy: "I Didn't Lie" |publisher=MTV Movies Blog |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> with some analysts commenting that they watched Smith "implode" and that he had "lost cred" and one prominent buyer saying, "He stole two hours and insulted every one of us...He was a little like the twisted preacher Michael Parks played in his film. It became life imitating art."<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |title=Sundance: Watching Kevin Smith Implode |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/sundance-watching-kevin-smith-implode/}}</ref> Smith joked about the people who had expected to buy the film at his Sundance speech:

<blockquote>
Now, we're obviously not selling the movie, so I'm sorry to . . . the distributors in the room. . . . Number one: I'm not that sorry. It's a fucking film festival. Come see a movie. . . . no hard feelings. Hopefully you don't mind. . . . Thank you for coming. . . . I will say this in my own defense . . . a lot of youse work for studios . . . you guys make a lot of trailers - you've lied to me many times. . . . I've seen many trailers where I'm like "this is awesome", and I put my money down, and I'm like "You fucking lying whores". So ladies and gentleman, as you can see we're up here alienating all our future work, just burning the bridge as we cross it, and ah, that means there's probably not going to be much studio help for me and Jon in the future.<ref name="indiewire1" /></blockquote>

According to some writers, the internet community seemed to galvanize in response to the controversy, "...it seems Kevin Smith finally has the Internet critical community united on the same side: against him."<ref>{{cite web|first=Shawn |last=Adler |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657531/kevin-smith-red-state.jhtml |title=Kevin Smith Responds To Backlash From ''Red State'' Sundance Premiere |publisher=MTV Movie News |date=February 8, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref> Smith countered allegations of dishonesty by saying, "And I told the truth, in my tweet. I said, 'If I get to Sundance, I intend to pick my distributor in the room, auction-style.' Auction-style—did I not do that?...I stood up there and said that I'm gonna take my movie—I'm gonna take it out and try not to spend money doing it."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Kim Masters, editor-at-large for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', interviewed associates close to Smith about his alleged career "implosion" at the Sundance debut of his film and the events leading up to it:
<blockquote>Smith was one of the first in the business to have a website and sell merchandise – pieces of film from his movies and action figures – to fans. But one source who has worked with him thinks Smith might be one of the first filmmakers to exploit and then be undone by social media, and that access to social media has eliminated any filter that might have protected Smith from emotional outbursts that, in this person's view, have undermined his career.<ref name="hollywoodreporter1" /></blockquote>

Smith responded to Masters, saying that it was "a ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' moment. I've got a little fish in a plastic bag and one idealistic secretary on my side, and the Bob Sugars seem to be leaning in doorways, smirking."<ref>{{cite web|first=Kevin |last=Smith |url=http://theredstatements.com/2011/02/01/some-questions-answers-about-red-state/ |title=Some questions & answers about Red State |date=February 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011 |work=theredstatements.com}}</ref>

In his Sundance Q&A, Smith compared the Indie scene from the 1990s to the present film landscape. He described the traditional film marketing system, in which studios buy films and then spend large amounts of money marketing it (often comparable to the film cost). He noted that it took seven years for his film ''Clerks'' to become profitable due to this system (see [[Hollywood accounting]]). He also compared selling a film to giving a child away for someone else to raise it.<ref name="indiewire1" /> Other telling quotes from his Sundance appearance referenced a sort of rebirth of the notion of independence in show business.

<blockquote>"We're starting over . . . true independence isn't making a film and selling it to some jackass. True independence is schlepping that shit to the people yourself. And that's what I intend to do. . ."<ref name="indiewire1" /></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Yes, anybody can make a movie, we know that now . . . What we aim to prove is that anybody can release a movie as well, and it's not enough to just make it and sell it anymore, I'm sorry. . . . Indie film isn't dead people, it just grew up. It's just indie film 2.0 now, and in indie film 2.0 we don't let them sell our movie, we sell our movie ourselves."<ref name="indiewire1" /><ref>[http://www.fastcompany.com/1720275/kevin-smiths-fake-auction-red-state-sundance-reveals-his-indie-rage Kevin Smith's Fake Auction for "Red State" at Sundance Reveals His Indie Rage], fastcompany.com, Ari Karpel, 2011</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Root for us if you will, hate us if you must. . . . But I can't think of a more interesting business news story that you're ever gonna hear about this fucking year, man. We're definitely gonna go out there and try to find a new distribution model."<ref name="indiewire1" /></blockquote>

Smith planned to spend no money on traditional advertising (billboards, TV, print media), instead using the aforementioned in-person theatre tour with accompanying Q&A show, word-of-mouth, Twitter,<ref name="indiewire1" /> social media, podcasts,<ref name="indiewire1" /> and other means not traditionally used by the studio system.

In April 2011, Smith revealed that ''Red State'' had already made its budget back with the film making $1 million on the first leg of the tour, $1.5 million from a handful of foreign sales and $3 million from a domestic distribution deal for VOD.<ref>[http://www.slashfilm.com/red-state-officially-black-screens-quentin-tarantino/ ‘Red State’ Officially In The Black, Screens For Quentin Tarantino]</ref>

The [[Westboro Baptist Church]] protested the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival because some of the elements of the film were "modeled after the founder and members of the Westboro Baptist Church."<ref>{{cite web|last=Marikar |first=Sheila |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-smiths-christian-fundamentalist-horror-movie-fuss/story?id=12745670 |title=''Red State'': Kevin Smith's Christian Fundamentalist Horror Movie: What's All the Fuss About? |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}</ref>

The tour went well and the experience was described in detail in many of the SModco podcasts.<ref>for example, the Plus One podcasts, SModcast.com, see episodes from 2011.</ref> On one of the tour stops, two defectors from the Westboro Baptist Church appeared at the public Q&A to ask Smith questions from the audience.

Edward Douglas of Shock Till You Drop panned the movie saying that, "it feels like one of Smith's Twitter rants fleshed out into film with equal portions of bile sprayed at both church and state."<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews: Red State |publisher=Shock Till You Drop |accessdate=January 28, 2011 |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/reviewsnews.php?id=17834}}</ref> Katey Rich of Cinema Blend reporting in her review, "Messy, overwritten, visually stylish, but kind of a bore. More like Kevin Smith than it looks because nobody ever stops talking. And it's not a horror movie by any usual definition. More like teen horror movie morphs into [[Waco siege|Waco disaster]].

James Rocchi writing for [[indieWire]] wrote that, "...Smith has gotten as far as he has with his comedies because it is a writer's genre more so than it is a director's. Horror is the genre of a director—pacing, feel, shots, editing—and Smith's skills are not up to the task..."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rocchi|first=James|title=Sundance '11 Review: Kevin Smith's ''Red State'' An Ambitious, Greatly Flawed Stab At Horror|publisher=[[indieWire]]|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2011|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/archives/2011/01/24/sundance_11_review_kevin_smiths_red_state_an_ambitious_greatly_flawed_stab_/}}</ref>
