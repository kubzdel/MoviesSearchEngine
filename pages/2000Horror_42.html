'''''In the Light of the Moon''''' (also known as '''''Ed Gein''''') is a 2000 American [[horror film]] directed by Chuck Parello, and written by Stephen Johnston. It is based on the crimes of [[Wisconsin]] murderer [[Ed Gein]].

== Plot ==

As a child, Wisconsinite Ed Gein is subjected to physical and psychological abuse at the hands of his religious fanatic mother, Augusta, and his alcoholic father, George. A year after his father dies, Ed goes out hunting with his older brother, Henry, and the two get into an argument over Henry wanting to leave home and Ed's devotion to Augusta. When Henry insults their mother, Ed flies into a rage and [[buttstroke]]s him; regaining his senses as Henry collapses, Ed panics and sets a fire, which Henry's "accidental" death is blamed on. 

Augusta later dies of a [[stroke]], leaving Ed alone in their desolate [[Plainfield, Wisconsin|Plainfield]] farm, which a despondent Ed allows to fall into a state of disrepair, with the exception of his mother's room, which Ed seals off. Living off of [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and the money that he makes from leasing land and babysitting neighborhood children, the increasingly unstable Ed spends his plentiful free time making nightly excursions into local cemeteries. Ed digs up the bodies of recently deceased elderly women, who he makes futile attempts at reviving before decorating parts of his home with pieces of them. The townspeople notice how perturbed Ed seems, but regard him as nothing more than a harmless eccentric with a morbid sense of humor and an obsession with graphic literature about crime, [[headhunting]] cannibal tribes, and [[Nazism]].

Ed begins suffering from hallucinations of Augusta, who he believes is contacting him from beyond the grave, commanding him to resurrect her and do the Lord's work by murdering sinful women. Ed's first victim is a local tavern owner, Mary Hogan, who he wounds with a handgun before bringing her to his home, where he leaves her bound to a bed. Days pass before Mary succumbs to her injury, at which point Ed mutilates and eats her remains, using what is left over to add to a female "flesh suit" that he has been constructing. 

Ed's delusions subsequently worsen, and he becomes convinced that Mary's death has brought back Augusta. A hallucination of Augusta eventually implores Ed to murder Collette Marshall, a hardware store owner who Ed had been unsuccessfully trying to woo. Ed reluctantly shoots Collette and transports her body to his house before having dinner with the Hills, a neighboring family who he surprises with "[[Venison]] steaks." Collette's employee, Brian, returns from a hunting trip and calls the police after finding the shop full of blood. 

Brian becomes convinced that Ed, whose behavior towards both Mary and Collette he had always found unnerving, is responsible for the women's disappearances. Brian rushes to Ed's home, where he unearths Collette's freshly decapitated and "[[Field dressing (hunting)|dressed out]]" body. Wanting to avenge his friends' deaths, Brian tracks Ed down to the Hill residence, but is talked out of shooting him by Sheriff Stillwell, who arrests Ed.

The film ends with a nonlinear [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that consists of officers uncovering evidence in Ed's home, interviews with Ed after he was placed in a [[psychiatric hospital]], and scenes in which Ed tries to keep his urges in check through prayer and rituals, and others in which he exhumes corpses, only to rebury them after snapping out of a [[Fugue state]]. An [[intertitle]] then states that Ed was buried next to his mother after dying of respiratory failure in 1984.

== Reception ==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 10% based on {{nowrap|10 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 4.1/10.<ref name="rottomatoes">{{cite web |title=Ed Gein (2000) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ed_gein |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixer |accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref> 
Neil Smith of the [[BBC]] called the film "gross and repellent" and awarded it a score of 2/5, writing, "Parello's stated intention is to explore the psychology of his twisted protagonist, but the result has all the hallmarks of a low-budget exploitationer, right down to its [[B movie]] leads [[Steve Railsback]] and [[Carrie Snodgress]]. Would it be too much to expect some thought or consideration for Gein's victims? Evidently so, given Hollywood's depressing habit of turning serial killers into cult heroes."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/07/05/ed_gein_2001_review.shtml|title = ''Ed Gein'' (2001)|last = Smith|first = Neil|publisher = [[BBC]]|date = 5 July 2001|website = bbc.co.uk|accessdate = 17 August 2017}} </ref> While ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' [[Philip French]] offered praise to Railsback's performance as Gein, he found the film itself to be "a generally unsensational chunk of bizarre [[Americana]]" that "adds little to our understanding of the man."<ref> {{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,525653,00.html|title = ''Ed Gein''|last = French|first = Philip|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''|date = 22 July 2001|website = theguardian.com|accessdate = 17 August 2017}} </ref> Fellow ''Guardian'' reviewer [[Peter Bradshaw]] had a similar response to the film, writing, "Really, it's the same old [[Pulp magazine|pulpy]], paranoid voyeuristic stuff, and Ed's fear and hatred of women is never that edifying. It's well acted, and effectively put together, but there is an insurmountable problem: gloomy, grave-robbing, body-chopping old Ed is, in the end, just a little bit of a bore."<ref> {{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jul/20/artsfeatures4|title = Give me some skin|last = Bradshaw|first = Peter|publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''|date = 20 July 2001|website = theguardian.com|accessdate = 17 August 2017}} </ref>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s'' Robert Koehler gave the film a negative review, deriding the film as being both lackluster and "a disappointingly mild re-creation of true events".<ref> {{cite web|url = https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/ed-gein-1200467636/|title = Review: ''Ed Gein''|last = Koehler|first = Robert|publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date = 29 April 2001|website = variety.com|accessdate = 18 August 2017}} </ref> While Steven T. Boltz of ''[[PopMatters]]'' enjoyed Railsback's acting and the film's historical accuracy, he was critical of its occasional lapses into [[sensationalism]] and of its inconsistent characterization of Gein, and ended his review of the picture with, "Is ''Ed Gein'' an attempt to bring the true story to light? I can't say. Did it? Well, yes and no. It's really a [[Mootness|moot]] point. The question I guess you have to ask yourself is this: Are you watching for historical accuracy or for entertainment?"<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.popmatters.com/review/ed-gein/|title = ''Ed Gein'' (2000)|last = T. Boltz|first = Steven|publisher = ''[[PopMatters]]''|website = popmatters.com|accessdate = 18 August 2017}} </ref> Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' afforded the film moderate praise, commending the performances, its atmosphere, and its historical accuracy, but went on to write, "''Ed Gein'' resists cheap humor in favor of moments that are inherently darkly comic, and tries for a seriousness of purpose, yet is at times awkward and under-inspired, creating a question as to whether so gloomy and repugnant a tale was worth telling simply for its own sake."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/04/entertainment/ca-59065|title = Somber Look at Serial Killer ''Ed Gein''|last = Thomas|first = Kevin|publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date = 4 May 2001|website = articles.latimes.com|accessdate = 18 August 2017}} </ref>

[[Ain't It Cool News]] also praised Railsback's performance, and concluded, "''Ed Gein'' is not must-see but it's a lot better than I thought it would be. I would recommend a rental to the curious horror or [[true crime]] fans out there looking for something sort of along the lines of ''[[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]]'', but tamer, but at the same time a lot sicker."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/9317|title = That sick Vern takes in ''Ed Gein''|last = Vern|first = Outlaw|publisher = [[Ain't It Cool News]]|date = 14 June 2001|website = aintitcool.com|accessdate = 17 August 2017}} </ref> Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' had a lukewarm reaction to the film, writing, "Half character study, half [[exploitation film]], ''Ed Gein'' is most effective when it focuses on Gein's halting attempts to connect with his neighbors, who treat him with the polite but decided distance of an adult dealing with a misbehaving but well-intentioned child. Where the film falters is in its attempts to explain away Gein's madness with a massive dose of [[Popular psychology|pop psychology]]."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.avclub.com/review/ed-gein-20383|title = ''Ed Gein''|last = Rabin|first = Nathan|publisher = ''[[The A.V.

Richard Gilliam from [[Allmovie]] felt that "Parello doesn't understand that credibility is not a substitute for style", but also commended the film's historical accuracy, and low-key approach to the material.<ref name="gilliamrev">{{cite web |last1=Gilliam |first1=Richard |title=Ed Gein (2001) - Chuck Parello |url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/ed-gein-v242402/review |website=Allmovie.com |publisher=Richard Gilliam |accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>
