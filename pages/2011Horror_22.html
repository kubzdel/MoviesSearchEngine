==Synopsis==
Filming was completed in 2009,<ref name="Little White Lies"/> shot in a [[mockumentary]] style,<ref name="First Post"/> using interviews and internet footage.<ref name="The Independent"/> The plot involves a group of five young deer hunters on a hunt in [[Scotland]].  Eve Jourdan ([[Tracy Ifeachor]]) bags a deer and is "blooded", a hunting ritual where the blood of a first kill is smeared on a hunter's face.  The following morning, an extremist animal rights action group calling themselves the "Real Animal League", kidnaps the five, strips them to their underwear, and leaves each alone in different locations across the hills, setting them as prey of other hunters.  The league films the events in [[First-person perspective|first person]] style as the five become the "[[Game (food)|game]]" in a hunt, with the intention of using the footage as a warning to other hunters. It is their "documentary" footage that is the basis of the film.<ref name="BritFilms"/><ref name="First Post"/><ref name="The Scotsman">{{cite news | url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Activists-take-aim-at-Mull.6741087.jp | title=Activists take aim at Mull hunt movie | accessdate=26 March 2011 | author=Martyn McLaughlin | date=27 March 2011 | work=[[The Scotsman]] | location=Edinburgh}}</ref><ref name="Bradford International Film Festival">{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/nmem/biff/11/Film_Detail.asp?filmid=9511 | title=World Premiere | accessdate=11 March 2011 | work=[[National Media Museum]]}}</ref>

==Promotion==
As part of the [[film promotion]], Revolver Entertainment created a website for the fictional Real Animal League (RAL),<ref name="The Scotsman"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realanimalleague.com/ |title=Real Animal League |publisher=realanimalleague.com |accessdate=2011-03-25 }}</ref> and a YouTube channel for the RAL, which both mentioned the film.  According to director Edward Boase, the production company created the appearance of a "fully-fledged animal rights website",<ref name="First Post"/> with links to real organisations in order to make the fake organisation appear authentic, but "not to the point where you couldn't find out that it wasn't real."<ref name="First Post"/>  As reported in ''[[First Post]]'', the hunting incident in the film was fictional, there was no kidnapping, and there is no organisation called the "Real Animal League".<ref name="First Post"/>  Revolver Entertainment's marketing department sent an email statement to the real animal rights group, [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF), supposedly from the Real Animal League, claiming that the film misrepresented the RAL. The email was reprinted in its entirety on the ALF website.<ref name="First Post"/><ref name="The Scotsman"/>  When the event and RAL were revealed as fictional, and after thousands of complaints,<ref name="London Evening Standard"/> YouTube deemed the videos as inappropriate and removed the footage that had been posted under the guise of the Real Animal League of the film's protagonists being chased and forced into confessions, and subsequently deactivated the YouTube channel of the fictional RAL.<ref name="First Post"/>

==Critical response==
The film's topic has provoked reactions from parties on both side of the hunting debate in the UK.<ref name="First Post"/><ref name="The Mail Online">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1366989/Andrews-10-000-night-Balkans.html | title=Isabella bares her soul | accessdate=22 March 2011 | work=[[Daily Mail|The Mail Online]] | location=London | first=Richard | last=Kay | date=17 March 2011}}</ref>  In promoting the film, its makers originally asserted that it was a re-creation of an actual event that occurred after the enactment of the 2005 hunting ban in England,<ref name="The Independent"/> maintaining that the film, rather than trying to make any political points, only investigates "the nature of [[extremism]]" in any form,<ref name="Little White Lies"/> and "encourages debate".<ref name="London Evening Standard"/>

The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' wrote that the film "caused outrage after graphic scenes showing activists attacking five deer-stalkers were posted on the internet, in a viral publicity campaign."<ref name="London Evening Standard"/>

''[[The Independent]]'' noted the film's controversial stance, and that as the film's asserted protagonists were a group of extreme animal activists, it generated "much chatter on the interweb" after clips appeared on Youtube.  They wrote however, "it all has the whiff of a clever publicity stunt".<ref name="The Independent"/>  This is a stance echoed in many other online reviews with suggestions that it is a [[mockumentary]] that leaves the viewer with {{sic}} "no doubt that it is fabricated".<ref name="First Post"/> A website called ''[[Film Pilgrim]]''. for example, noted that the project first began as an online viral video, but was expanded into a feature film, writing that the expanded footage "has many people debating about the authenticity of the footage."  They praised the film's score, writing "The soundtrack for ''Blooded'' is one of its most rewarding elements", being "the bulk of the glue that holds the film together."  They offered that the "idea of turning an internet viral video into a feature film/documentary is a pretty interesting concept", but that the film fell flat stylistically in that the "reconstructed footage feels like an actual film which detracts from the realism that the original virals created". They speculated in their review that there was in fact no such organization as the ''Real Animal League'' at all, and that the film was created as a hoax in the ''[[Blair Witch]]'' tradition.<ref name="The Film Pilgrim">{{cite web | url=http://www.thefilmpilgrim.com/reviews/blooded-review/2112 | title=Blooded Review | accessdate=11 March 2011 | author=Mike Bridges | date=6 March 2011 | work=The Film Pilgrim}}</ref>

''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'' classed it as an example of a "fantastic piece of filmmaking that shows what is achievable if you get creative within your budget".<ref name="The List">{{cite web | url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/33449-dvd-roundup-phenomena-the-beyond-senseless-blooded-skyline-primal-and-island-of-death-reviewed/ | title=Blooded | accessdate=24 March 2011 | author=Henry Northmore | date=24 March 2011 | work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack was created by award-winning and [[Ivor Novello]]-nominated composer [[Ilan Eshkeri]] and [[Jeff Toyne]].  The score was recorded by the [[London Metropolitan Orchestra]] at [[British Grove Studios]] and produced by Steve McLaughlin.<ref name="Napier News">{{cite web | url=http://www.napiersnews.com/2011/03/revolver-entertainment-presents-blooded.html | author=Jim Napier | title=Revolver Entertainment presents: BLOODED, premiering in UK cinemas April 1st | accessdate=11 March 2011 | publisher=Napier News | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714153503/http://www.napiersnews.com/2011/03/revolver-entertainment-presents-blooded.html | archivedate=14 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>
