}}
'''''Texas Chainsaw 3D''''' (initially titled as '''''Texas Chainsaw''''') is a 2013 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[John Luessenhop]], with a screenplay by [[Adam Marcus (director)|Adam Marcus]], Debra Sullivan and Kirsten Elms and a story by [[Stephen Susco]], Marcus and Sullivan. It is the seventh installment in [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]] and was presented in [[3D film|3D]]. The film serves as a direct sequel to the 1974 film ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (ignoring the events of the subsequent installments). The film stars [[Alexandra Daddario]], Dan Yeager, [[Trey Songz]], [[Tania Raymonde]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Thom Barry]], [[Paul Rae]] and [[Bill Moseley]], with [[Gunnar Hansen]] and [[Marilyn Burns]], who had appeared in the original 1974 film. The story centers on Heather, who discovers that she was adopted after learning of an inheritance from a long-lost grandmother. She subsequently takes a road trip with her friends to collect the inheritance, unaware that it includes her cousin, Leatherface, as well. Filming began in the summer of July 2011, and it was released January 4, 2013.

Although not well received, ''Texas Chainsaw 3D'' was a commercial success, making $47.2 million from a $20 million budget. It was also the last film both Burns and Hansen starred in before they both died in 2014 and 2015 respectively. A [[prequel]] that takes place before the original 1974 film, titled ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'', was released in 2017.

==Plot==
Following [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|the events of the original film,]] the people of Newt, [[Texas]], led by Mayor Burt Hartman (Paul Rae), burn down the farmhouse of the murderous [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#The Sawyer Family|Sawyer clan]] in an act of [[vigilante justice]]. The arsonists are proclaimed heroes of the community, and the entire Sawyer family is killed. However, an infant, Edith Rose Sawyer, is found by one of the townsmen, Gavin Miller, who promptly murders her mother, Loretta Sawyer. Gavin and his wife Arlene take the child into their care and raise her as their own daughter.

Decades later, Heather (Alexandra Daddario) discovers that she was adopted after receiving a letter that her grandmother, Verna Carson, has passed away. Heather, her boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), her best friend Nikki, and Nikki's boyfriend Kenny travel to her grandmother's home in Newt to collect her inheritance. Along the way, the group picks up a hitchhiker named Darryl. Upon arriving, Heather is given a letter that she neglects to read. As the group explores the house, they decide to stay the night. Heather and her friends leave to buy food and supplies, leaving Darryl behind to look after the house. Darryl begins stealing valuables and is killed by [[Leatherface]] (Dan Yeager) in the basement.

Later that day, Heather and her friends return to find the house ransacked. While Kenny is preparing dinner, he goes downstairs to the cellar where Leatherface impales him on a hook. Heather finds Darryl's body and is attacked by Leatherface, but she manages to escape. Nikki and Ryan draw the attention of Leatherface, while Heather gets in the van and picks up her friends. Using his chainsaw, Leatherface cuts through one of the tires, which causes the van to crash, killing Ryan on impact. He then chases Heather to a nearby carnival, where Deputy Carl Hartman (Scott Eastwood), the mayor's son, and the police are patrolling the grounds.

Heather escapes to the police. While at the police department, she begins digging through the files, learning how the Sawyer family was killed and empathizing with them. The sheriff and Hartman send an officer to investigate the Carson estate. Over the phone, the officer reports his findings. He finds Nikki hiding in a freezer and accidentally shoots her in the head before he himself is killed by Leatherface. Leatherface skins the flesh from the officer's cadaver and uses it to create a new flesh mask.

Enraged by the officer's findings, Hartman vows to end the remaining Sawyers, kidnapping Heather and taking her to a slaughterhouse to lure Leatherface. Listening over the deceased officer's police radio, Leatherface learns of Heather's location and goes to the slaughterhouse to kill her. Before he is able to do so, he sees a Sawyer birthmark on Heather's chest and releases her. Leatherface is then attacked from behind by Hartman. Hartman physically and repetitively beats Leatherface, until Heather tosses Leatherface his chainsaw. He uses it to force Hartman to his death in a meat grinder. Afterwards, Leatherface and Heather return to the Carson Estate, where Heather reads the letter she was given. It informs her that she is Edith Sawyer, that Leatherface is her cousin and that he will protect her, but it also requests that she take care of him in return.

In a [[post-credits scene]], Heather's adopted parents show up at the Carson estate to visit Heather, intending on greedily splitting her assets. As they wait in front of the door, Leatherface comes through the door with his chainsaw in hand.
