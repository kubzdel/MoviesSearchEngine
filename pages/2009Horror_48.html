'''''Dark Fields''''' (also '''''Douglas Schulze's Dark Fields''''' and '''''The Rain''''') is a 2009 American [[horror film]] directed by Douglas Schulze, written by Kurt Eli Mayry and Douglas Schulze, and starring [[David Carradine]], [[Dee Wallace Stone]], [[Richard Lynch]], [[Ellen Sandweiss]], and [[Sasha Higgins]].

== Plot ==
Cari, a college student, suddenly falls very ill.  Panicked, she calls her parents, who tell her to return home.  There, her parents reveal that her entire town has been cursed and demand that she sacrifice her younger brother to avoid an even worse curse.  Cari initially goes along with her parents' wishes but rebels at the last second.  The two siblings go on the run from the townspeople, who desperately try to find them.  Meanwhile, flashbacks reveal intertwining tales of nineteenth century and mid-twentieth century families that attempt to deal with the same curse.  Eventually, a demonic man shows up to collect on the debt owed by the town, and Cari is forced to confront him.  After a series of cat and mouse games, a friendly dog appears and kills the demon.
