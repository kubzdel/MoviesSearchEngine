==Plot==
2 detectives, in a race against each other, to solve 2 different homicides; no leads, only a joker calling card at each murder scene.
It all starts with a Poker game; losing the ultimate bet to the worst person. Jaska's a soul hunter; a demon. He's a fugitive from the justice of man and the divine and has plagued mankind for centuries. He and Forneus, his ally, are responsible for a swathe of bloody murders in Barcelona. Jaska ([[Darwin Reina]]) and Forneus are macabre, multilingual and deadly - with a thirst for the taste of the damned. They disguise all of their perversions and their hunger, and don sheep's clothing, then they seek to lure their victims in. But not if Detective Laura can stop them; she's willing to risk everything to catch these killers, putting her life on the table as the ultimate stake.
