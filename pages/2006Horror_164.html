==Full summary==
"In writer/director [[Andrew C. Erin]]'s frightening feature debut, a brutal murder from the past haunts the small towns surrounding Lake Sam. After a disturbed teenage boy slaughtered his entire family, he disappeared into the woods and authorities never found him. Forty years later, Sam, a nature-loving city girl who grew up in the area and was named after the lake, has returned to her parents' lake house in the wake of her father's death. At the last minute, she decides to bring with her a group of friends for some relaxation and fun. The friends immediately notice the strange corn husk dolls that hang from houses nearby; eventually, they convince Sam and her local friend Jesse to tell them the story of the murder and the yearly disappearances that have terrorized the area towns. Sam agrees on the condition that they visit the house where the murder occurred. It is in this decrepit home that the group discovers an old diary containing secrets of the legend of Sam's Lake. Set against the backdrop of a beautiful yet foreboding lake, this haunting film offers a spine-tingling story of twisted familial relations and the horrifying consequences of trying to purge oneself of the past." â€“ Kellen Quinn

==Director's statement==
"Sam's Lake is, believe it or not, a very personal story. Having spent many summers next to an isolated lake in the mountains, I was very motivated to tell this story. At the age of 12, my father shared with me a similar story the about an abandoned old house just minutes from our family's cabin. The story plays out almost word for word as it does around the campfire scene in the film. A story which I have then used over the years to frighten and thrill many unsuspecting guests."{{Cite quote|date=January 2017}}
