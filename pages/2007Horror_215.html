==Background==

== Plot ==
Professor Scott Kinney is an American geologist monitoring a local volcano when Supergator, a ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' recreated from fossilized preserved DNA escapes from a secret bio-engineering research center/laboratory. Along the way, it eats thirteen people, including two lovers, three drunken teens, three models, two tourists and a fisherman. It also eats Alexandra Stevens and Ryan Houston.

Kinney joins forces with another scientist, Kim Taft, and a Texan alligator hunter named Jake. They pursue the monster as it heads down river intent on destroying a luxurious resort packed with hundreds of tourists. Conventional weapons have no effect on it at all and Kim is eaten. So they, with the help of Carla, plan a trap for it using a fake volcano. They lure him on to it, with Jake using himself as live bait. Supergator devours him and Kinney kills it by shooting at the fake volcano, which then blows up the beast.
