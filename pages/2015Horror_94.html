==Plot==
Pat ([[Anton Yelchin]]), Sam ([[Alia Shawkat]]), Reece ([[Joe Cole (actor)|Joe Cole]]) and Tiger ([[Callum Turner]]) are members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the [[Pacific Northwest]]. After their gig is cancelled, local radio host Tad (David W. Thompson) arranges a show through his cousin, Daniel ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]), at a [[neo-Nazi]] [[skinhead]] bar in the woods outside [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

After the show, Pat returns to the [[green room]] to retrieve Sam's phone and sees the body of a girl, Emily (Taylor Tunes), who has been stabbed to death by a neo-Nazi. Pat calls the police, but bar employees Gabe ([[Macon Blair]]) and Big Justin ([[Eric Edelstein]]) confiscate the band's phones and hold them hostage in the green room. Gabe pays a skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to the call. He consults with bar owner and skinhead leader Darcy ([[Patrick Stewart]]), who decides to kill the band to eliminate witnesses.

The band overpowers Big Justin and hold him hostage, taking a boxcutter from his pocket and his gun. They negotitate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the gun. Pat agrees, but as he opens the door, Emily's friend Amber ([[Imogen Poots]]) realises it's a trap and shouts. Darcy and his men slash at Pat's arm with machetes until he drops the gun, but he manages to close the door. Big Justin attacks the band, but Reece chokes him into unconsciousness. When Big Justin surprises Reece by awaking again, Reece chokes Big Justin again and Amber kills him with a box cutter.

Searching for a way out, the band discover an underground drug lab, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they exit the green room into the empty club, but are attacked by a dog, which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone [[Audio feedback|feedback]]. Reece tries to flee through a window, but is hacked to death by a skinhead.

Pat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room. Darcy sends Daniel into the club to kill the band, who Darcy claims murdered Emily. Amber reveals to Daniel that it was really Werm who murdered her after discovering he and his girlfriend Emily planned to leave the skinheads. Daniel agrees to help them escape and leads the band into the club where he is shot to death by the club's bartender. The group kills the bartender and takes his shotgun, but Sam is killed by a dog, and Darcy's men wound Amber, who scrambles back to the green room with Pat.

Darcy sends skinheads Jonathan and Kyle to kill Pat and Amber, and leaves with the bodies, planning to stage their deaths to appear as if they were killed trespassing. Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab while Kyle remains in the green room where Amber ambushes and cuts his throat, killing him with the boxcutter. As Pat fights Jonathan, Amber sneaks up and shoots him. Gabe enters the green room to find his companions dead and surrenders to Pat and Amber.

Holding Gabe at gunpoint, they trek through the woods. When Pat hears Darcy and his men staging the crime scene, he and Amber go after them. Gabe volunteers to go into a nearby farm and call the police. Pat and Amber kill skinheads Clark and Alan. Darcy attempts to pull a revolver from his jacket but is executed by Pat and Amber. Their ammunition and energy spent, Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road and wait for the police.
