===''The Egg of the King''===
{{nihongo|''Berserk: Golden Age Arc I - The Egg of the King''<ref>http://fantasiafest.com/2012/en/films-schedule/282/berserk-golden-age-arc-i-the-egg-of-the-king</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.com/Berserk-The-Golden-King-Blu-ray/dp/B008UE8ICK/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1374152199&sr=8-2&keywords=berserk</ref>|ベルセルク 黄金時代篇I 覇王の卵|Beruseruku Ōgon Jidai-hen Wan Haō no Tamago}} was released on February 4, 2012 in Japan.

Guts, a mercenary, attracts the attention of the Band of the Hawk and is forced into joining the group after being defeated by its leader Griffith twice. Once the Hawks defeated the kingdom of Chuder's Black Ram Iron Lance Cavalry, they are recruited by Midland for its war against the rival kingdom. During one siege, Guts and Griffith encounter the demon Nosferatu Zodd, who notices the Behelit around Griffith's neck and warns Guts that Griffith will be his doom. In time, Griffith's gradual rise in status is ill-received by the noblemen, and a failed assassination attempt by the king's brother Yurius results in his murder by Guts, who was also forced to kill the noble's son Adonis to leave no witnesses. Guts, emotionally scarred by what he has done, would later hear Griffith discussing his idea of friendship with the Midland Princess Charlotte and is further unsettled to find he and the other Hawks are a means to their leader's end.

===''The Battle for Doldrey''===
{{nihongo|''Berserk: Golden Age Arc II - The Battle for Doldrey''<ref>http://fantasiafest.com/2013/en/films-schedule/246/berserk-golden-age-arc-ii-the-battle-for-doldrey</ref><ref>https://www.amazon.com/Berserk-Golden-Battle-Doldrey-Blu-ray/dp/B00CENSU3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1374152199&sr=8-1&keywords=berserk</ref>|ベルセルク 黄金時代篇II ドルドレイ攻略|Beruseruku Ōgon Jidai-hen Tsū Dorudorei Koryaku}} was released on June 23, 2012 in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-02-20/berserk-2nd-film-slated-for-june-23|title=Berserk's 2nd Film Slated for June 23|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=20 February 2012|accessdate=18 July 2012}}</ref>

For three years, Guts believed his mission was to pursue Griffith's dream together with him. But after coming to understand Griffith's outlook as well as fighting 100 men plus a bear (and winning), Guts realises that he would need to leave the Band of the Hawk to be considered Griffith's equal and truly be called his friend. After forming a bond with Casca while they are separated from the others, Guts and the Hawks take part in a bloody battle to capture the impenetrable Fortress of Doldrey from the Chuder Empire's army of 30,000 strong defenders. A month after capturing the fortress and winning the war, Guts parts ways with Griffith after defeating him in a duel. Griffith does not take his former ally's departure well, and in a lapse of judgment he is caught sleeping with the king's daughter, Charlotte. Charged with treason for his actions, Griffith is imprisoned in the Tower of Rebirth while the members of the Band of the Hawk are branded criminals.

===''The Advent''===
{{nihongo|''Berserk: Golden Age Arc III - The Advent''<ref>http://fantasiafest.com/2013/en/films-schedule/247/berserk-golden-age-arc-iii-the-advent</ref>|ベルセルク 黄金時代篇III 降臨|Beruseruku Ōgon Jidai-hen Surī Kōrin}} was released on February 1, 2013 in Japan.

It has now been a year after Guts dueled Griffith to leave The Band of the Hawk. Upon learning the Hawks have been labeled outlaws in Midland, Guts returns to aid them in freeing Griffith from the Tower of Rebirth. However, they find out that Griffith is a broken man-barely alive and rendered a mute cripple after months of physical and mental torture. When Griffith tries to end his life upon realizing what he has been reduced to, a solar eclipse occurs that draws him, Guts, Casca and their comrades into another dimension where they encounter the archdemons known as the God Hand. Told that his tribulations have been leading to this moment, Griffith is given a choice to be reborn as the final member of the God Hand and accepts while knowing his transition requires his allies being offered as sacrifices. In this hopeless battle with the God Hand's monstrous horde of Apostles-former humans like Nosferatu Zodd-Guts's attempt to rescue Griffith fails as the latter accepts the deal to make his dreams a reality. The result finds Guts and Casca escaping the sacrificial slaughter, while Griffith is reborn as Femto. Guts and Casca are spirited back to their world by the mysterious Skull Knight, but not without repercussions: Casca loses her sanity from the nightmarish ordeal she endured after being raped by Femto; and Guts losing his left forearm and right eye. A post-credits scene shows Guts beginning his journey to hunt down the Apostles and the God Hand so he  can kill Griffith.

==Music==
The soundtracks for the film series was composed and arranged by [[Shirō Sagisu]], with the theme song composed and arranged by [[Susumu Hirasawa]]. The insert song of all films, "Aria", was sung by Hirasawa, a live performance (from ''[[Phonon 2555 Vision]]'') is included on the home video releases of the second film, another live version is on the ''[[The Secret of The Flowers of Phenomenon#Interactive Live Show|Nomonos and Imium]]'' DVD; the ending theme of the first film, {{nihongo|"Utsukushii Mono"|ウツクシキモノ||"Pretty Thing"}}, was sung by the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer [[Ai (singer)|AI]] (in an uncharacteristic epic ballad style) and composed by Rykeyz and Redd Styiez; lastly, the ending theme of the third film, "Breakthrough", was performed by [[Chemistry (band)|CHEMISTRY]], written by Kaname Kawabata, Hidenori Tanaka and UTA, and arranged by Sagisu, Miho Hazama and CHOKKAKU. A special TV program, narrated by [[Akio Ōtsuka]] (the voice actor for the Skull Knight), that summarized the events of the first two movies, used the Hirasawa song {{Nihongo|Horde of Thistledown|冠毛種子の大群|Kanmō Shushi no Taigun}} (from ''[[The Secret of The Flowers of Phenomenon]]'') as its ending theme.

== Reception ==
Reception for ''Berserk: The Golden Age'' was mostly mixed, with [[Kotaku]]'s Richard Elsenbels panning the first two installments of the trilogy, but describing the third installment, ''Berserk: Golden Age Arc III: Descent'', as supreme and delivering an experience surpassing the original manga both in emotional turmoil and brutal violence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5981641/the-third-berserk-movie-is-by-far-the-most-violent-thing-i-have-ever-watched|title=The Third Berserk Movie is by Far the Most Violent Thing I Have Ever Watched|last=Elsenbels|first=Richard|date=|website=Kotaku|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> In Chris Qu's review for ''ReelRundown'', he mentions that despite the overuse of poor CGI, he was glad to have viewed the films and recommends them to anime fans seeking out grittier films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reelrundown.com/animation/Berserk-The-Golden-Age-Arc-Trilogy-Anime-Film-Review|title="Berserk: The Golden Age" Arc Trilogy - Anime Film Review|last=Qu|first=Chris|date=|website=ReelRundown|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Mr. Conair of ''Theanimehub'' says that the adaptation, though hampered by insufficient length and lacking build-up in many areas, does have many instances of tight directing, strong emotional execution and even lighter moments that made the source material great.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theanimehubcom.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/berserk-the-golden-age-trilogy-review/|title=Berserk: The Golden Age Trilogy Review|last=|first=|date=|website=Theanimehub|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> The trilogy earned audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes, with ''Berserk: The Golden Age Arc 1 - The Egg of the King'' scoring 75%; ''Berserk: The Golden Age Arc II - The Battle for Doldrey'' scoring 85%; and ''Berserk: The Golden Age Arc III - The Advent'' receiving 85%.
