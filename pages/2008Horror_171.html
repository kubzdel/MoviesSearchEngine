==Reception==

French [[film review]] website ''CinemaFantastique.net'' awarded it 3/4, praising the film's atmosphere, cinematography, and for effectively capturing the 16th century period. However, they criticized the film's non-linear story, and dialogue which made it difficult to fully understand the film.<ref name="cinemagazinerev">{{cite web|title=Sauna - Sauna (2008) un film de Antti-Jussi Annila|url=http://cinemafantastique.net/Sauna.html|website=CinemaFantastique.net|publisher=Metzgerin|accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref> James Gillett from ''Digital Retribution'' gave the film a score of 4/5, writing, "''Sauna'' is an impressive film; thematically rich and stunningly realised. It's the kind of horror movie seldom seen. Those who occasionally enjoy something a little more cerebral than your average horror effort will find themselves with a deeply rewarding and engaging film. Wash your sins.
