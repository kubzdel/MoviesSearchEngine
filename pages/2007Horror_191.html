==Plot==
Joan Burrows ([[Angela Bettis|Bettis]]) returns to her hometown of [[Ovid, Colorado]] to attend her niece Olympia's (Blanton) high school graduation, but finds herself confronted by her past in the town. Before the graduation is to occur, a young couple goes missing and within a few days a mutilated body is found in the water during a town fish festival. This initiates flashbacks in which Joan's dark past is learned. When Joan was 17, she and her best friend were kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer by the name of Bishop ([[Ben Cotton|Cotton]]). Bishop bound Joan and her friend to an autopsy table where one girl was tortured while the other had the power to make it stop simply by demanding the death of the friend.<ref name="fango">{{cite web| title= Scar| publisher= [[Fangoria (magazine)|fangoria.com]]| url= http://www.fangoria.com/ghastly_review.php?id=4796 | accessdate= 2007-08-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109191059/http://www.fangoria.com/ghastly_review.php?id=4796 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-09}}</ref> Joan was able to escape and kill her captor, but was left as the sole survivor of the spree with a scar on her cheek.

Despite the use of 3-D an early review by ''[[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria.com]]'' explains that the 3-D "doesn’t overshadow the film, which would be just as effective without it; instead of tossing in over-the-top, in-your-face FX like those seen in ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'', SCAR's dimensional cinematography encourages a subtler, more voyeuristic feel".<ref name="fango"/>

==All-digital workflow==
''Scar'' is the first feature length narrative 3D movie be completed in a completely digital workflow. The production workflow was designed by [[NHK]] and [[DitlevFilms]]. Using a [[Stereoscopic 3d|3D camera rig]] engineered by NTS in Japan (built around two digital [[High-definition video|high definition]] [[Sony]] cameras) the all-digital workflow was supported by an on-site digital lab. The lab facilitated an HD offline version of the footage so editing could begin while filming. The lab also generated dailies and full resolution plates for [[visual effects|VFX]].

==Postproduction==
The editing process of ''Scar'' was done entirely in HD (720p) and was using an editing method that allowed both stereoscopic video streams to be cut and viewed simultaneously. Proprietary scripts were used to generate 3D previews using a [[DepthQ]] 3D projector and CrystalEyes3 glasses. 
The postproduction process was designed and implemented by Christian Ditlev Bruun (DitlevFilms) and included FotoKem, Technicolor, and Plaster City in Los Angeles. Final stereoscopic adjustments were done in Skip City in Kawaguchi, Japan with NTS (a division of [[NHK]]).

==Reviews and buzz==
According to early reviews at one instance a man was "out cold and paramedics were actually called" and "one viewer ran out of the theater and threw up".<ref name="BD"/>

==Release==
On May 19, 2007 Scar3D opened at the Cannes Film Market. It has been the #1 film at the box office in several countries around the world, including Russia where it opened in 3D on 296 screens.

==Home media==
On October 1, 2010 Scar3D was the first-ever stereoscopic 3D [[Video on demand|Video-on-demand]] film released through major cable broadcasters for [[3D television]]s in the United States.
