'''''Grub Girl''''' is 2006 [[Pornographic film|pornographic]] [[horror film]]. It is an adaptation of the [[Verotik]] [[comic book]] of the same name by [[Edward Lee (writer)|Edward Lee]].<ref name="LittleWilliamson2005" />

== Plot ==
At an unspecified point in the future, the government created a type of jet which never needed refueling but which leaked a type radiation that caused those exposed to it to die and reanimate as intelligent [[zombie]]s dubbed "Grubs". One of the victims of the radiation is a [[prostitute]] whose scarred body is taken to a laboratory, where she wakes up while being sexually abused by a pair of [[Necrophilia|necrophilic]] scientists, who she kills after deeming what they have done "the worst fuck of my life".

"Grub Girl" adjusts to being a zombie and returns to being a prostitute, discovering that being [[undead]] is advantageous to her career, as she is immune to disease and nearly impervious to pain. One night, after making a house call to a married couple, Grub Girl is accosted by her [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Rome, who forces her to [[Fellatio|fellate]] him in an alley. Sick of Rome's abuse, Grub Girl bites off his penis and rips out and devours his innards.

With Rome gone, Grub Girl becomes a madam and opens a [[brothel]] that specializes in Grubs. One customer of the establishment is a [[bi-curious]] married woman, who Grub Girl sets up with a pair of her girls, who the patron uses a [[strap-on dildo]] on. The film ends with Grub Girl [[Conversation opener#Conversation openers for romantic purposes|propositioning]] the prospective customer she had been telling her story to, before breaking the [[fourth wall]] by snarking, "Okay, don't act like you've never thought about it before. Why else would you be watching this crummy movie? Now beat it, unless you're throwing some green my way".
