'''''The Skeptic''''' is a 2009 American suspense thriller film written and directed by [[Tennyson Bardwell]]. Starring [[Tim Daly]], [[Zoe Saldana]], and [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]], and featuring [[Robert Prosky]] and [[Edward Herrmann]], it depicts the story of an attorney who inherits a seemingly haunted house, though he does not believe in the supernatural.

Written in the 1980s, the film was shot in [[Upstate New York]] from late 2005 through 2006. Completed in 2008, it was screened at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] before being purchased by [[IFC Films]] for airing on their [[video on demand]] channel as well as a limited theatrical release. The film received poor reviews and was criticized for its lack of suspense, poor dialogue, and for being reminiscent of 1970s television horror films.

==Plot==
A police officer responds to a 911 call that came from a large home, upon his investigation he comes across an old woman who had apparently died of fright, holding a set of [[rosary beads]]. Bryan Beckett ([[Tim Daly]]) is an overly analytical lawyer, whose lack of true emotion has caused a rift in his marriage. When he gets word that his old aunt had died, he assumes he inherits her home as a result of being her remaining kin. He makes it clear he does not believe in [[Afterlife|life after death]], or many other [[superstition]]s and treats her death and funeral like everyday events. His friend and partner at the law firm Sully ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]) has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] when they visit the home and warns Bryan not to enter the closet behind the cross. He recovers having no recollection of saying this. Wanting a separation from his wife to "scare her" into accepting his behavior, Bryan decides to spend a few weeks at his aunt's home. While he is there several strange occurrences are ignored by him that might hint at haunting behavior; a chest in the upstairs bedroom falls unaided, a large shrine is found in the closet behind a [[crucifix]], and the house is filled with strange unexplained noises and glimpses of what appears to be a woman.

Bryan learns that the house was willed to an institute that studies [[sleep disorder]]s. Upon investigation, the director Koven shows him another department that deals with [[psychic]] energy for scientific research. Though he maintains that they do not believe in the [[paranormal]], Bryan decides to contest the will. But the sounds of whispering about an old trunk send him back. After Koven discounts his theories of voices in his house, Bryan goes to his [[psychiatrist]] Shepard ([[Edward Herrmann]]) who decides that Bryan's stress-induced [[insomnia]] is to blame. The visions become more vivid, and Cassie ([[Zoe Saldana]]) a psychic specimen of Koven's arrives to scan the house. She comes to several conclusions that Bryan had not disclosed, and the strange sound of someone falling down a flight of stairs that only he can hear clearly disturbs him. While going through an old trunk he found in the basement, Bryan and Cassie come across a doll that absolutely terrifies him into an emotional outrage. The next day, he begins to sense recurring memories of [[Child abuse|his mother abusing him]] and locking him in the same closet that seems to be the source of the hauntings. Shepard confirms this, and allows Bryan to remember that as a five-year-old, due to the harsh treatment by his mother, he consciously placed toys on the stairs, causing her to fall down them to her death. Shepard and Bryan's father used Bryan's [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]] to make him forget about the event entirely. This makes Bryan realize that it is the ghost of his mother haunting the house.

He returns to his aunt's home, but decides against going in. He sees Cassie's car parked in the driveway and calls her from outside the house but he is unable to reach her, so he enters the home searching for her. He calls her cell phone again and she answers. He asks why she left her car in the driveway and she says she didn't. He looks out the window and finds that her car is not there. Bryan realizes that his mother tricked him to get him in the house. A now angry Bryan, storms from the room and finds his mother's body lying on the floor at the foot of the stairs. The shock causes him to faint and he falls down the stairs, landing where his mother had died. As his mother touches his face, he receives a vision of the picnic he had missed on the day before her death, when she had locked him in the closet for leaving a sock on the floor when he cleaned his room. It is implied in this vision, that she is apologizing to him for her deeds; then all goes dark and Bryan finds himself at the foot of the stairs as the screen goes dark.

Shooting began in 2005, with eight weeks spent filming in various locations around the [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] area &ndash; where Bardwell lives in [[Ballston Spa]] &ndash; including the city Court House, the Olde Bryan Inn, the Union Gables Bed and Breakfast as well as [[Union College]] in nearby [[Schenectady]],<ref name="Daily Union" /><ref name="Gallagher2009">{{cite web |url=http://capitalnews9.com/content/headlines/139039/-the-skeptic--comes-back-home/Default.aspx |last=Gallagher |first=Vince |title='The Skeptic' Comes Back Home |publisher=Capitol News 9 |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref><ref name=Saratogian>{{cite web|url=http://www.saratogian.com/articles/2009/05/06/news/doc4a00dd62cb885411187257.txt |last=Donohue |first=Emily |title=Film shot locally to hit big screen |publisher=''The Saratogian'' |date=2009-05-06 | accessdate=2009-05-11}}</ref> [http://www.batchellermansioninn.com/ The Batcheller Mansion Inn] was used for the three-story Victorian mansion where much of the film takes place.

In creating the film, in a markedly different genre from his first work, the 2004 comedy ''[[Dorian Blues]]'', Bardwell aimed to create a film that would be "a [[Rorschach test]] for people's beliefs", in which viewers would have different ideas of what happened. Intended to concentrate on the psychological rather than gore, the film has no "blood and guts" and instead requires viewers to be skeptical and open to the different possible interpretations of the ending.<ref name="Times Union" /><ref name="Daily Union" />  ''The Skeptic'' marks Bardwell's first time working with Hollywood actors, having used only locals and new theater school graduates in his first film.<ref name="Times Union" />

He both praised and criticized Bardwell's writing and direction as being "carefully though without inspiration", and the dialog as "bald and blatant" lacking in subtext and subtlety.<ref name="The Hollywood Reporter">{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/film-review-the-skeptic-1003968303.story |title=Film Review: The Skeptic |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=2009-04-30 |accessdate=2009-05-07 }}</ref>

In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] called the film "a cut-and-dried Freudian melodrama that gives repressed memory a supernatural dimension" and preferred a regular teen horror flick to Bardwell's attempt at making a "haunted house movie for grownups".<ref name="New York Times">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/movies/01skep.html?ref=movies |title=Movie Review - The Skeptic (2008) |first=Stephen |last=Holden |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-05-07 }}</ref> Steve Ramos, ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice Magazine]]'', felt the film was "polished but dull" and that its lack of special effects would result in it being unable to attract mainstream audiences. He also felt Daly overacted in the role and "lack[ed] the emotional depth to support an entire movie, ghost story or otherwise." He praised cinematographer Claudio Rocha for his work in creating a believable haunted house and the film's overall high production values, wishing it had been matched by quality storytelling.<ref name="Box Office Magazine">{{cite web |url=http://boxoffice.com/reviews/2009/05/the-skeptic.php |title=The Skeptic |first=Steve |last=Ramos |work=[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice Magazine]] |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-05-07 }}</ref>
