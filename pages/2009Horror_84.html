'''''Friday the 13th''''' is a 2009 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Marcus Nispel]] and written by [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon|Damian Shannon]] and [[Mark Swift and Damian Shannon|Mark Swift]]. The film is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|''Friday the 13th'' film series]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Joal Ryan|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b100114_friday_13ths_lucky_number_422_million.html|title=Sorry, Shopaholic, Hockey Masks Are the New Black|publisher=[[E!

Nispel also directed the [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake]] of [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974), while Shannon and Swift had written the screenplay for the 2003 [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]''. ''Friday the 13th'' follows Clay Miller ([[Jared Padalecki]]) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney ([[Amanda Righetti]]), who is captured by  [[Jason Voorhees]] ([[Derek Mears]]) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake.

The 2009 film was originally conceived as an [[origin story]], but the project evolved into a [[Remake#Reimagine|re-imagining]] of the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel a little sympathy for him, but not enough that he would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for ''Part III''; though there were subtle changes. ''Friday the 13th'' includes some of [[Harry Manfredini]]'s musical score from the previous ''Friday the 13th'' films because the producers recognized its iconic status.<ref name="SG">{{cite web|author=Ryan Stewart |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday+the+13th%3A+The+Producers/ |title=Friday the 13th: The Producers |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504133108/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday%2Bthe%2B13th%3A%2BThe%2BProducers/ |archivedate=May 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

''Friday the 13th'' was released in theaters on Friday, February 13, 2009.<ref name="release"/> It received mainly negative reviews and earned approximately {{USD|19 million}} on its opening night and $40 million during its opening weekend, when it broke two records; the highest-earning opening day for the film series and the highest-earning opening weekend for any horror film. {{As of|July 2014}}, it is the second-highest grossing film in the ''Friday the 13th'' film series ($65 million), and has earned over $92 million worldwide.

==Plot==
<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE basic events. For a horror movie, that means we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !-->

On June 13, 1980, a young [[Jason Voorhees]] (Caleb Guss) watches as his mother [[Pamela Voorhees|Pamela]] ([[Nana Visitor]]) is beheaded by a camp counselor (Stephanie Rhodes), who was trying to escape Mrs. Voorhees's murder spree around Camp Crystal Lake. Almost thirty years later, a group of friends{{mdash}}Wade ([[Jonathan Sadowski]]), Richie ([[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]), Mike ([[Nick Mennell]]), [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Whitney Miller|Whitney]] ([[Amanda Righetti]]) and Amanda ([[America Olivo]]){{mdash}}arrive at Crystal Lake on a camping trip to search for [[marijuana]] growing in the woods. That night, an adult Jason ([[Derek Mears]]), kills everyone except Whitney, whom he captures since she resembles his mother at a young age.

Six weeks later, Trent ([[Travis Van Winkle]]), his girlfriend Bree ([[Julianna Guill]]), and friends Chelsea ([[Willa Ford]]), Jenna ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), Chewie ([[Aaron Yoo]]), Nolan ([[Ryan Hansen]]), and Lawrence ([[Arlen Escarpeta]]) arrive at Trent's summer cabin on the shore of Crystal Lake. Meanwhile, Whitney's brother [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Clay Miller|Clay Miller]] ([[Jared Padalecki]]) arrives at the lake to search for her. Clay visits Trent's cabin, and Jenna agrees to help him search for Whitney. As they search, Jason kills Chelsea and Nolan while they are [[wakeboarding]] on the lake. Clay and Jenna search the old Crystal Lake campgrounds where they see Jason hauling a body into the abandoned camp house.

Jenna and Clay run to warn the others about Jason, who arrives and disconnects the cabin's electricity. Jason kills Chewie and Lawrence outside the cabin and sneaks inside and kills Bree. Trent, Clay, and Jenna escape the cabin, but Trent is killed when he reaches the main road. Jason chases Clay and Jenna back to the campgrounds, where Clay discovers Jason's lair and finds his sister chained to a wall. Clay frees Whitney, and all three try to escape as Jason arrives. They find an exit, but Jenna is killed before she can escape. Jason corners Clay and Whitney; Whitney confuses Jason by pretending to be Pamela, then stabs him in the chest with his own machete. Clay dumps Jason's "corpse" into the lake, but before Clay and Whitney leave, Jason bursts through the [[Dock (maritime)#American English|wooden dock]] and grabs Whitney.

==Production==
===Development===
[[New Line Cinema]]'s [[Toby Emmerich]] approached [[Platinum Dunes]] producers [[Michael Bay]], Brad Fuller and [[Andrew Form]] about remaking ''Friday the 13th'' in the same way they restarted [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' franchise]]. They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from [[Paramount Pictures]], New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainment{{mdash}}the latter run by ''Friday the 13th'' creator [[Sean S. Cunningham]].<ref name="Rotten">{{cite web|author=Ryan Rotten|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8261|title=On the Set of Friday the 13th|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=December 1, 2008}}</ref> Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films, including the title. Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kit|first1=Borys| last2=Masters|first2=Kim|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/christopher-nolans-interstellar-warner-bros-562879|title=Warner Bros. Gives Up 'Friday the 13th' Rights to Board Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar'|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=June 5, 2013 }}</ref> Fuller and Form said they did not want to make ''Friday the 13th Part 11'' or ''12'', but wanted to rework the mythology. They liked elements from the first four films{{mdash}}such as plot points and ways particular characters are killed{{mdash}}and planned to use these in their remake, which they did with Paramount's approval.<ref name="SG"/> Fuller said, "I think there are moments we want to address, like how does the hockey mask happen. It’ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one. Where is Jason from, why do these killings happen, and what is Crystal Lake?"<ref name="SG"/> The producers initially expressed an interest in using [[List of characters in the Friday the 13th series#Tommy Jarvis|Tommy Jarvis]], a recurring character who first appeared in ''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'', but the idea was scrapped.<ref name="Chud">{{cite news|author=Devin Faraci |url=http://chud.com/articles/articles/8452/1/EXCLUSIVE-PAGING-TOMMY-JARVIS/Page1.html |title=Exclusive: Paging Tommy Jarvis? |publisher=CHUD |date=January 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101215851/http://www.chud.com/8452/EXCLUSIVE-PAGING-TOMMY-JARVIS |archivedate=January 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

Though the producers decided that ''Friday the 13th'' would not be an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed.<ref name="Chud"/> Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in ''[[Friday the 13th Part 2]]''—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ryan Rotten|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=6458|title=Set Visit Preview: Friday the 13th|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref>

Unlike both horror remakes, ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' (2003) and ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]'' (2005){{mdash}}which were also produced by Bay, Form, and Fuller{{mdash}}it was decided that ''Friday the 13th'' would not be a period piece. Form and Fuller said the film was not strictly a remake so there was no reason they could not set the story in the 2000s.<ref name="SG"/> In October 2007, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the writers of ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', were hired to write a script for ''Friday the 13th''.<ref name="Shan/Swif">{{cite news|author=Borys Kit|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3|title=Duo pumps new blood into 'Friday the 13th'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=October 2, 2007|accessdate=October 21, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011092956/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ia426500233e132c71ea0487278b5bbb3|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> [[Jonathan Liebesman]] was in negotiations to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts meant he was unavailable and Fuller and Form chose [[Marcus Nispel]].<ref name="SG"/> Nispel was apprehensive about taking the job, mainly because he would be taking over another film franchise, but Fuller eventually persuaded him to direct the project.<ref name="Rotten"/> [[Principal photography]] began on April 21, 2008, in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, and finished on June 13, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brad Fuller |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/platinumdunes/ |title=Why THIS Friday the 13th is important! |publisher=Platinum Dunes Official Blog |date=June 6, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612181840/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/platinumdunes/ |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |df= }}</ref>

Stuntman [[Derek Mears]] was hired to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard.<ref name="Rotten"/><ref>{{cite news|author=Jay Frasco|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=5995|title=Casting of new 'Friday the 13th' villain splits fans down the middle|publisher=IFMagazine|date=March 31, 2008|accessdate=April 5, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401233510/http://www.ifmagazine.com/new.asp?article=5995|archivedate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about the production of a new ''Friday the 13th'' and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brittany Kaplan|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/12/mears.jason.fridaythirteenth/index.html|title=New Jason Unmasked for ''Friday the 13th''|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=February 25, 2009}}</ref> The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role.<ref name="Rotten"/> According to Mears, "They were like, 'You're really nice&nbsp;...&nbsp;are you going to be able to switch over, right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'".<ref name="Rotten"/> Mears said he related to "Jason the victim" when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high school{{mdash}}specifically those with physical deformities{{mdash}}for being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake.<ref name="SG2">{{cite web|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday+the+13th%3A+Derek+Mears/ |title=Friday the 13th: Derek Mears |publisher=[[SuicideGirls.com]] |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417154350/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Friday%2Bthe%2B13th%3A%2BDerek%2BMears/ |archivedate=April 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

When Mears went to audition for the role, he was asked, "Why do we need an actor as opposed to just a guy in a mask?" Mears said portraying Jason is similar to [[Theatre of ancient Greece#Masks|Greek Mask Work]], in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his [[Pit stop|pit crew]]. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.<ref name="DMint">{{cite news| author=Paulington James Christensen III| url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/set-visit-jason-voorhees-returns-to-camp-crystal-lake-for-friday-the-13th| title=Set Visit: Jason Voorhees Returns to Camp Crystal Lake for Friday the 13th!| publisher=Movieweb.com| date=June 9, 2008| accessdate=March 27, 2011}}</ref>

Amanda Righetti had not read the script when she was offered the role of Whitney Miller. She wanted to be part of the ''Friday the 13th'' franchise from the start. Righetti said she wanted to act in the film after she read the script.<ref name="Rotten"/> Jared Padalecki describes Clay Miller as a real hero because he sets out "to do the right thing" when his sister goes missing, and goes about it as a "lone wolf" who wants to take on the responsibility alone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=9563|title=Shock Video: Friday the 13th Cast Interviews!|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=February 11, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> Adjustments were made to the filming schedule to accommodate Aaron Yoo, who portrays Chewie. Yoo had his appendix removed shortly before filming began, and could not film his scenes immediately. As soon as Yoo was ready for filming, Nispel immediately hung him upside down from some rafters, exposing the staples over his surgical wound for the character's post-death shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=9540|title=Interview: Friday the 13th Marcus Nispel|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>

Fuller and Form said the casting process for ''Friday the 13th'' was more difficult than that for ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' because thirteen young actors were involved in ''Friday the 13th'', as opposed to five in ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''. The pair continually recast roles to find which actors worked best together. This recasting process lasted until the start of filming. ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'''s [[Richard Burgi]], who was cast as Sheriff Bracke, did not sign his contract until twelve hours before he was due to start filming his scenes.<ref name="SG"/>

===Writing ===
When Shannon and Swift began writing the script for ''Friday the 13th'', they imposed some rules based on their experiences of writing ''Freddy vs. Jason'' on themselves. They wanted their teenage characters to "sound normal". Shannon and Swift said they did not want the characters to know Jason's name or to become what they considered "the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' cliché where it's a bunch of kids trying to figure something out".<ref name="Shan/Swift">{{cite web|author=Ryan Rotten|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=9423|title=Interview: The Writers of Friday the 13th|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=February 3, 2009|accessdate=February 3, 2009}}</ref> The writers also wanted to distance themselves from self-referential slasher films such as ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' and to give the film a gritty, more 1980s feel that had been lost in recent films. They wanted to create a quick, loose Jason. The writing team decided to create a version of Jason "who was actually in the woods surviving off the land", and whose killings are presented as a way of defending his territory rather than randomly murdering whoever came along.<ref name="writers">{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |author=Sheila Roberts |title=Friday the 13th Screenwriters Interview |publisher=Movies Online |accessdate=February 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213220911/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_16407.html |archivedate=February 13, 2009 |df=mdy }}</ref>

{{quotebox|align=right|width=30%|quote="We felt it was important to go back to the basics and put Jason back in the woods again."
|source=Mark Swift on conceptualizing a new ''Friday the 13th'' film.<ref name="writers"/>}}

The writers did not want to spend a lot of time covering Jason's childhood experiences, which they felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass lying on the ground as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost  $100,000.  Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.<ref name="Shan/Swift"/>

The writers had written a scene in which Willa Ford's character Chelsea is stranded on the lake for hours after she sees Jason standing on the shore.<ref name="writers"/> Eventually, the girl would tire and drown. Shannon and Swift felt this was something they had not seen in slasher films, but later decided to make the death quicker and more visceral.<ref name="Shan/Swift"/> A similar incident occurred with Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna. Panabaker said Jenna was scripted to survive longer than she did in the final version of the film; Jenna was supposed to escape Jason's lair and recite a "cute line" about a second date with Clay before an elaborate fight sequence that ends in her death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=10147|title=Panabaker Describes Alternate Friday the 13th Kill|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> The writers wanted to strike a balance between finding new and interesting ways to kill characters and paying homage to popular death scenes that appeared in previous installments of the series. To accomplish this, Shannon and Swift included the presence of a wheelchair and a sweater in Jason's tunnels; the character Mark ([[Tom McBride (actor)|Tom McBride]]) was a paraplegic who was killed by Jason in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and Mrs. Voorhees wore the sweater in the original version of ''Friday the 13th''.<ref name="Shan/Swift"/>

The writers altered Jason's character. Mears describes him as a combination of [[John Rambo]], [[Tarzan]], and the Abominable Snowman from ''[[Looney Tunes]]''. To Mears, Jason is similar to Rambo because the audience sees him setting up the other characters to fall into his traps. Like Rambo, he is calculating because he feels he has been wronged and he is fighting back; he is supposed to be more sympathetic in this film.<ref name="DMint"/> However, Fuller and Form said they learned from their experience with ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'' not to make Jason too sympathetic to the audience. They decided against an origin story because they did not want to focus on Jason's tormented childhood because the producers felt that would "demystify" the character in an unhelpful manner. Fuller said, "We do not want him to be sympathetic. Jason is not a comedic character, he is not sympathetic. He's a killing machine. Plain and simple."<ref name="SG"/>

===Visual effects===
The producers used Asylum Visual Effects to create digital effects for ''Friday the 13th''. Although director Marcus Nispel is a proponent of practical effects, Asylum had to digitally create some shots to protect the actors and to allow the director to achieve a specific look. Visual effects supervisor Mitchell Drain assigned ten crew members to work on the visual effects; they first analyzed the script in pre-production to decide which shots would need digital effects. Asylum worked on 25 shots for the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=1|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (1)|publisher=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Richiesdeath.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with a video camera kneels to film as an actor pulls a machete from the head of another actor who is sitting on the ground. Behind the cameraman, another man records sound from the scene they are filming, while a third man stands in the background.|left|Mears being filmed performing the killing of Ben Feldman's character. Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete to show it being pulled away from Feldman's face.]]
One of the first scenes Asylum was given was the scene depicting the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into her sleeping bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland  was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in her sleeping bag. Instead of creating a [[Computer-generated imagery|computer generated]] (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames.<ref name="VFX2">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=2|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (2)|publisher=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref> Another composite shot is used in the scene in which Chelsea is hit by a [[Powerboating|speedboat]]. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.<ref name="VFX3"/>

Asylum also enhanced some of Jason's signature machete kills. In several scenes, the company used a computer-generated machete because Nispel wanted to show multiple characters' deaths in one shot instead of cutting from the acts of murder to the aftermath of their deaths. In one scene, Jason kills Richie by slamming a machete into his head. Instead of using a real machete with a fake head, Nispel had Feldman act dead as Mears pulled a handle{{mdash}}with only a portion of the blade attached{{mdash}}away from Feldman's head. Then, Asylum digitally created the rest of the machete blade to complete the effect.<ref name="VFX2"/> For this scene, Asylum adjusted the actor's facial expressions to create a "post mortem" look. The special effects team digitally drooped half of the actor's face to appear as though the nerves had been severed by Jason's machete.<ref name="VFX3">{{cite web|author=Silas Lesnick|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3909&page=3|title=Friday the 13th: Compositing Kills at Camp Crystal Lake (3)|publisher=VFX World|date=February 16, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2009}}</ref>

Asylum digitally created weapons for various scenes. In the scene in which Nolan is killed suddenly by a shot in the head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the air{{mdash}}in one instance appearing in the same frame as the actor{{mdash}}would be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete [[3D computer graphics|3D model]] of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.<ref name="VFX3"/>

===Creating Jason===
{{further2|[[Jason Voorhees#Concept and creation|Jason's development over time]]}}
[[File:Jason2009face.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A sculpture of a male torso and head is overlaid with fake skin, which has been molded to appear as lean muscle. The face is disfigured, the left side of the mouth is curled upwards as though snarling, the right eye droops and is pressed into the eye socket, and the top of the head is bald with strands of hair on the back. The skin is pale.|A [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Jason as seen in the film. Effects artist Scott Stoddard combined characteristics from Jason's appearance in ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and ''The Final Chapter'' when crafting his design.]]

Effects artist Scott Stoddard described his look for Jason's face as a combination of Carl Fullerton's design for ''Friday the 13th Part 2'' and [[Tom Savini]]'s design for ''Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter''. Stoddard's vision of Jason included hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face. Stoddard tried to craft Jason's look so it would allow more human side of the character to be seen.<ref name="Rotten"/> Mears was required to wear full body make-up from the chest upwards while performing as Jason. The actor wore a chest plate with fake skin that would adjust to his muscle movements. He wore a hump on his back to give the impression that Jason had [[scoliosis]]. A prosthetic eye was glued to Mears' face to show realistic eye movements.<ref name="DMint"/> Stoddard initially spent three-and-a-half hours applying the make-up to Mears' head and torso.<ref name="Rotten"/> He was eventually able to reduce the required time to just over an hour for scenes in which Mears wore the hockey mask. For scenes in which Jason's face is revealed, it took approximately four hours to apply the make-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|title=Fridaythe13thfilms.com Exclusive Interview with new Jason, Derek Mears!|author=Tony Carroll|publisher=Fridaythe13thfilms.com|date=January 31, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724030403/http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/blog/fridaythe13thfilmscom-exclusive-interview-with-new-jason-derek-mears/|archivedate=July 24, 2011}}</ref>

For Jason's wardrobe, Mears was given a pair of combat boots and a "high-priced t-shirt" that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by combining a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears wanted to use the hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his "kill movements." The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed over the top of the military jacket. Mears called it a "giant [[Frankenstein]] jacket." He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back.<ref name="DMint"/> Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There  were things I thought were great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit. Break them up."<ref name="Rotten"/>

===Music===

Form and Fuller recognized the iconic status of the music used in the first four ''Friday the 13th'' films. For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by [[Harry Manfredini]]. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used [[Steve Jablonsky]] to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film.<ref name="SG"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Todd Gilchrist|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/925/925754p3.html|title=Set Visit: Friday the 13th (page 3)|publisher=IGN|date=October 30, 2008|accessdate=February 4, 2009}}</ref> Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score ''Friday the 13th'' after having worked with him on the remake of ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre''. Nispel told Jablonsky  he wanted him to create something that Nispel could "whistle when [he] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, "I don't believe that, when you watch a ''Friday the 13th'' film, you want to feel like [[John Williams]] is sitting next to you with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/1382-fridays-nispel-talks-hodder-and-manfredinis-absences-etc.html|title=Friday's Nispel talks Hodder and Manfredini’s absences, etc.|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=February 13, 2009|accessdate=March 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219213131/http://fangoria.com/home/news/9-film-news/1382-fridays-nispel-talks-hodder-and-manfredinis-absences-etc.html|archivedate=February 19, 2009}}</ref>

[[Alonso Duralde]] wrote that the film should please slasher fans, but that it added nothing new to the genre or the franchise and would not appeal to people who did not like slasher films. Duralde criticized the film for adding a black and an Asian character in an attempt to "update the movie for the new millennium".

In contrast to the film's detractors, ''[[The New York Times]]'s'' Nathan Lee said ''Friday the 13th'' managed to "reboot the concept" of the original films with style.
