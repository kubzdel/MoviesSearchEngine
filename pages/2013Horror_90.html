==Plot==
In 1983, a group of high school students led by Biff run into their nerdy classmate Sam ([[Ashley Lloyd]]), whom they instantly begin to bully. In order to prove himself to Biff and also win the affection of Biff's good natured girlfriend, Jenny (Erin Hayes) he agrees to sneak into an old abandoned amusement park to prove his courage. 

Tired of Biff's antics, Jenny follows Sam into the amusement park. After catching up with him and suggesting they should leave, feeling something is not right about the park. Suddenly, various attractions in the amusement park begin to light up. Their presence in the park has come to the attention of a creature known as Gingerclown ([[Tim Curry]]) who now attempts to torment and kill the duo. Trying to find a way out of the park, the two run into the other hideous creatures that live within the park ([[Brad Dourif]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Michael Winslow]]). Getting suspicious of how long Jenny and Sam have been alone together, Biff enters the park searching for them. He is soon found by Gingerclown, who eventually murders him. Jenny and Sam are separated from each other, with Sam being chased by Gingerclown and Jenny is captured by a giant spider ([[Sean Young]]), but  she manages to escape by killing her.

Although they are briefly reunited, Sam is captured by Gingerclown, while Jenny hides. Jenny is soon confronted by Gingerclown, but before he can kill her she chains him to a barrier, while Sam sneaks up behind him and strangles him to death with a chain. Morning comes and the pair, having survived the night, share a kiss.
