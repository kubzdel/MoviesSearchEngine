The plot follows a group of college students who retreat to a remote forest cabin where they fall victim to backwoods zombies and the two technicians who manipulate the ongoing events from an underground facility.

Goddard and Whedon, having worked together previously on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', wrote the screenplay in three days,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |location= |isbn=9781848565241 |page=13 }}</ref> describing it as an attempt to "revitalize" the [[slasher film]] genre and as a critical satire on [[torture porn]].

The film was originally slated for release on February 5, 2010 by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[United Artists]], but was indefinitely shelved due to ongoing financial difficulties. In 2011, [[Lionsgate]] picked up the distribution rights. The film premiered on March 9, 2012 at the [[South by Southwest]] film festival in [[Austin, Texas]] and was released in the United States on April 13, 2012, grossing over $66 million worldwide.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
In a [[high tech]] underground facility, senior technicians Sitterson and Hadley discuss plans for a mysterious operation. A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in [[Stockholm]] has just ended in failure.

Elsewhere, American college students Dana, Holden, Marty, Jules, and Curt are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest, a cabin recently acquired by Curt's cousin. From their underground facility where they possess significant technological control over the area in which the cabin is situated, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase [[libido]]. They take bets from coworkers as to what kind of monster will attack the students and discuss the failures of similar rituals in other nations.

In the cabin's cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites [[incantation]]s from the journal, inadvertently summoning the [[zombie|zombified]] Buckner family despite Marty's warnings. By releasing [[pheromone]]s, Hadley successfully induces Curt and Jules to have sex. Attacked by the marauding Buckner zombies, Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes to alert the group. Marty, a frequent [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners. Later, the facility workers learn that the ritual in Japan has also ended in failure, meaning that the American ritual is humanity's last hope. It becomes apparent that the ritual involves [[blood sacrifice]].

Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their [[recreational vehicle|RV]], but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt jumps a ravine on his motorcycle in an attempt to flee and alert the authorities, only to crash into a [[Force field (fiction)|force field]], killing him. Holden and Dana retreat to the RV to plan their next move, but one of the Buckners, hiding within all along, fatally stabs Holden as they are driving away, resulting in the RV crashing and sinking into a lake. Dana escapes and swims ashore and is beset in turn. As she is attacked, Sitterson, Hadley, and their staff celebrate the successful completion of the ritual, viewing the events from their underground facility. The celebration is interrupted by a phone call pointing out that Marty has survived. His heavy marijuana use has apparently rendered him immune to Sitterson and Hadley's manipulations.

Marty rescues Dana and takes her to a hidden elevator he discovered under a grave. They descend into the underground facility, where a menagerie of monsters are imprisoned. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cabin's cellar and realizes that those items gave victims the opportunity to choose the agents of their own deaths during the ritual. Cornered by the facility's security personnel, she and Marty release the monsters, including [[zombies]], [[goblins]], [[mutants]], [[witches]], [[Ghost|wraiths]], a [[basilisk]], a [[werewolf]], a [[unicorn]], a killer [[robot]], a giant [[snake]], and an [[evil clown]]. They wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a [[merman]] and Sitterson escapes to the lower level.

Dana and Marty flee the carnage. Dana accidentally mortally wounds Sitterson, who begs her to kill Marty. Fleeing further, they discover an ancient temple and are confronted by the facility’s leader, known only as The Director. She explains that they are participating in an annual ritual sacrifice to appease the Ancient Ones (described as “giant evil gods”). Each facility’s ritual conforms to the rules of that region’s local lore; in America young people are chosen to be sacrificed based on similarity to certain archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). In order to complete the ritual the whore must die first and [[final girl|the virgin must survive or die last]]. Since all other facilities have failed, the penalty for not completing the ritual is the extermination of the entire human race. Hence, The Director urges Dana to kill Marty. Dana considers, but she is interrupted by a [[werewolf]] attack, while zombie Patience Buckner appears and kills The Director.

Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty share a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] while awaiting their fate. The temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges, destroying the facility and the cabin itself.<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. -->

==Production==
With a production budget of $30 million, [[principal photography]] began on March 9, 2009 in [[Vancouver]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouverfilm.net/2009/02/goddard-starts-mordecai-in-vancouver.html|title=Goddard Starts "Mordecai" In Vancouver- March 9...|publisher=Vancouver Film|date=February 7, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref> and concluded in May 2009. [[Joss Whedon]] co-wrote the script with ''[[Cloverfield]]'' screenwriter [[Drew Goddard]], who also directed the film, marking his directorial debut. Goddard previously worked with Whedon on ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' as a writer.

Whedon described the film as an attempt to revitalize the horror genre which he, along with director/co-writer Goddard, felt had "devolved" with the introduction of [[torture porn]]. He called it a "loving hate letter" to the genre, continuing:
{{quote|On another level it's a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies. I love being scared. I love that mixture of thrill, of horror, that objectification/identification thing of wanting definitely for the people to be all right but at the same time hoping they’ll go somewhere dark and face something awful. The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had swung a little too far in that direction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Film |first=Total |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/joss-whedon-talks-the-cabin-in-the-woods |title=Joss Whedon talks The Cabin in the Woods |publisher=TotalFilm.com |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref>}}

Concerning the sheer number of creatures to be designed and made for the film, AFX Studio's [[David LeRoy Anderson]] estimated that "close to a thousand" people were turned into one of around 60 different monster types.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |location= |isbn=9781848565241 |page=152 }}</ref> The task necessitated renting a much larger facility to use as a workspace, as a crew of around 60 people were recruited. The producers told them to commence work on December 15, 2008, ahead of the official January 1, 2009 start date. They only completed the work by the March 9, 2009 production date because, as Anderson stated "We had nearly seventy people at peak, but in effect we had a hundred and forty people, because everybody had at least two jobs...it was crazy, but people had an incredible time...none of us are ever going to forget it, and we're never all going to be in the same room again."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |location= |isbn=9781848565241 |page=153 }}</ref>

The underground complex, elevators, and the control room were all sets, but for several wide shots, the [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]]'s Aerospace building was used. Production designer Martin Whist referenced [[Stanley Kubrick]] and commented: "It's very high-tech industrial, and it's a brand new building, never been shot in before...I wanted [the elevators] to be without any controls...to almost feel like a glamorized freight elevator...The lobby I wanted to look slightly utilitarian, contemporary and institutional...sharp and almost characterless."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cabin in the Woods: The Official Visual Companion |year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |location= |isbn=9781848565241 |pages=134–137 }}</ref>

===Critical response===
<!-- WHEN UPDATING THE REVIEW AGGREGATE SCORES, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU UPDATE EVERY FIELD IN THE CITATION PARAMETER, INCLUDING THE ACCESS DATE. -->
The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 92%, based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''The Cabin in the Woods'' is an astonishing meta-feat, capable of being funny, strange, and scary – frequently all at the same time."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cabin in the Woods (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cabin_in_the_woods/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film achieved an average score of 72 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cabin-in-the-woods |title=The Cabin in the Woods Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 27, 2012}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying that "''The Cabin in the Woods'' has been constructed almost as a puzzle for horror fans to solve. Which conventions are being toyed with? Which authors and films are being referred to? Is the film itself an act of criticism?".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120411/REVIEWS/120419993/ |title=The Cabin in the Woods |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=April 17, 2012|date=April 19, 2012}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it "fiendishly funny". Travers praised Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz for their performances, and wrote, "By turning splatter formula on its empty head, ''Cabin'' shows you can unleash a fire-breathing horror film without leaving your brain or your heart on the killing floor."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-cabin-in-the-woods-20120412|title=The Cabin in the Woods|last=Travers|first=Peter|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=April 12, 2012|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

Cinema Blend's Editor in Chief, Katey Rich, gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, <blockquote>"Even when the story sticks firmly in standard horror territory, this particular group of attractive kids is especially fun to spend time with... You'll have to see it, and you ''really'' have to see it if you love horror, hate horror, or have any interest in seeing how the genre can function as a playground for something completely fresh."</blockquote> She praised Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford "in roles that are more fun to discover as you go along – they do get a lot of the best jokes, though, and their scenes show a lot of Goddard's skill in handling the rhythm of a scene."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/The-Cabin-in-the-Woods-5775.html |author= Rich, Katey |year= 2012 |title= ''The Cabin in the Woods'' |publisher= Cinema Blend |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref> Jenkins and Whitford were also admired by ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' ("Whitford and Jenkins clearly delight in the verbose script") and by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', whose reviewer (granting 9 of 10 stars) called ''Cabin'' "a smart sendup of horror movies and mythology...with a peculiar relish that testifies to the moviemakers' love of genre film... a smart, sarcastic and deliriously fun journey into the belly of the horror beast." He cited the "witty banter, creative twists" and "clippy, quippy dialog that lifted ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' to cult status."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/review-cabin-in-the-woods/ |author= Wallace, Lewis |date= April 13, 2012 |title= Review: Cabin in the Woods Rips Horror a New One |publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref>

Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', giving the movie 3 of 4 stars, wrote, <blockquote>"A fiendishly clever brand of meta-level genius propels ''The Cabin in the Woods'', a pulpy, deceivingly insightful send-up of horror movies that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps. [It] comes not only to praise the slasher-, zombie- and gore-fests of yore but to critique them, elaborating on their grammatical elements and archetypal figures even while searching for ways to put them to novel use. The danger in such a loftily ironic approach is that everything in the film appears with ready-made quotation marks around it...

Eric Goldman, writing for [[IGN]], called the movie "an incredibly clever and fun take on classic horror movie tropes."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/04/12/the-cabin-in-the-woods-review |author= Goldman, Eric |date= April 12, 2012 |title= What's Truly Lurking in the Darkness |publisher= [[IGN]] |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref> ''[[San Francisco Chronicle|SF Gate]]'' said, "The cliches come at an onslaught pace" in "a wonderfully conceived story that gives a bigger than life and fascinating explanation for why so many horror movie cliches exist in the first place... By the time the ride is over, director Drew Goddard and co-writers Goddard and Joss Whedon will change course three or four times, nodding and winking but never losing momentum."<ref>{{cite news |last= Hartlaub |first= Peter |title= ''Cabin in the Woods'' Review |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= December 18, 2012 |url= http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Cabin-in-the-Woods-review-3477920.php |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref> Of the screenplay by Goddard and Whedon, a [[CNN]] reviewer praised "these horror hipsters' acidic, postmodern designs on one of the movie industry's hoariest, least respected staples... the dialogue is always a notch or three smarter and snappier than you'd expect."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/13/showbiz/movies/cabin-in-the-woods-review |author= Charity, Tom |date= April 13, 2012 |title= Review: ''Cabin in the Woods'' is Sheer Horror Heaven |publisher= [[CNN]] |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref>

Keith Phipps of ''The A. V. Club'' addressed: <blockquote>"the difficult challenge of putting across a satirical film with a serious body count. ''Cabin'' touches on everything from ''[[Evil Dead (franchise)|The Evil Dead]]'' and ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday The 13th]]'' to the mechanized mutilations of the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' series while digging deeper into the [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] roots of horror in an attempt to reveal what makes the genre work... It’s an exercise in [[metafiction]] that, while providing grisly fun, never distances viewers. And it’s entertaining, while asking the same [[Rhetorical question|question]] of viewers and characters alike: Why come to a place you knew all along was going to be so dark and dangerous?"<ref name = "AV">{{cite web |url= http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-cabin-in-the-woods,72287/ |author= Phipps, Keith |date= April 12, 2012 |title= The Cabin in the Woods |publisher= ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' |accessdate= July 16, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In a more mixed review [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', calling herself "a wised-up viewer," gave the film a "B−" grade and said, "The movie's biggest surprise may be that the story we think we know from modern scary cinema — that horror is a fun, cosmic game, not much else — here turns out to be pretty much the whole enchilada." She shrugged off the talents of Whitford and Jenkins: "These two experienced actors provide the film's adult-level entertainment."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20567682,00.html | title=The Cabin in the Woods Review | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 23, 2012 | accessdate=August 30, 2012 | author=Schwarzbaum, Lisa}}</ref>

Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' believed that the film "is an inside joke" and also said, "The laughs [in the film] come easily, the screams not so much."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/13/entertainment/la-et-cabin-in-the-woods-20120413|last=Sharkey|first=Betsy|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Review: 'The Cabin in the Woods' is Joss Whedon's inside joke|date=April 13, 2012|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref> David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' remarked, "It’s just too bad the movie is never much more than a hollow exercise in self-reflexive cleverness that’s not nearly as ingenious as it seems to think."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/the-cabin-in-the-woods-film-review-chris-hemsworth-298129|last=Rooney|first=David|work=The Hollywood Reporter|title=The Cabin in the Woods: Film Review|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref>

[[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Novelty and genre traditionalism often fight to a draw. Too much overt cleverness has a way of spoiling dumb, reliable thrills. And despite the evident ingenuity and strenuous labor that went into it, ''The Cabin in the Woods'' does not quite work." Scott added, <blockquote>"Some of the pleasure of the first (and best) part of ''The Cabin in the Woods'' comes from trying to see just over the narrative horizon and figure out what these incompatible sets of clichés have to do with each other. Two distinct kinds of movie are being yoked, by violence, together, and the performers inhabit their familiar roles with unusual wit."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/04/13/movies/the-cabin-in-the-woods-by-drew-goddard-and-joss-whedon.html?ref=movies&_r=0 | title=Taking a Chain Saw to Horror Movie Clichés | work=New York Times | date=April 12, 2012 | accessdate=August 30, 2012 | author=Scott, A.O.}}</ref></blockquote>
