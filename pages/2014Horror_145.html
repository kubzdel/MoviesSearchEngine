'''''Ouija''''' is a 2014 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[Stiles White]] in his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]], produced by [[Jason Blum]], [[Michael Bay]], [[Andrew Form]], [[Bradley Fuller]], and Bennett Schneir and written by [[Juliet Snowden]] and White, who previously together wrote ''[[The Possession]]''.<ref name=Juliet-Stiles>{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=U recruits pair to rewrite, helm ‘Ouija’|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/u-recruits-pair-to-rewrite-helm-ouija-1118056618/|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=variety.com|date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> It stars [[Olivia Cooke]], [[Ana Coto]], [[Daren Kagasoff]], [[Douglas Smith (actor)|Douglas Smith]], and [[Bianca A. Santos]] as teenagers who have unleashed spirits from a [[Ouija|Ouija board]].

The film was released on October 24, 2014 by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film was a commercial success, receiving $103.6 million worldwide over a $5 million budget, but was overwhelmingly panned by critics. A prequel, ''[[Ouija: Origin of Evil]],'' was released in 2016.

==Plot==
Debbie Galardi recalls playing [[Ouija]] with her best friend Laine Morris as children. In present day, Debbie throws her Ouija board into the fire, burning it. Debbie implies to Laine that something strange happened with the [[Ouija board]]. After Laine leaves, the Ouija board reappears in Debbie's bedroom. Debbie becomes possessed and hangs herself with Christmas lights inside her home.

Laine attends Debbie's wake with her boyfriend Trevor, younger sister Sarah, friend Isabelle, and Debbie's boyfriend Pete. The five friends meet at Debbie's house and use her Ouija board to try communicating with her. Strange things happen, and a presence smashes Pete's hand and face into a mirror. Later, the friends start finding the phrase "hi friend" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in different places, like Isabelle's car window, a tunnel wall, Pete's desk, and Laine's computer. Thinking Deb is trying to communicate with them, the group has another Ouija session. They then discover that they are actually in contact not with Debbie but with a spirit calling itself "DZ." Laine sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut. The girl warns them to run because her mother is coming. Laine sees an old woman, and everyone flees. Laine later learns that Deb found the Ouija board in her [[attic]] and played alone.

Isabelle is possessed and killed by being smashed into her bathroom sink and cracking her skull open. Laine and Pete search Deb's attic and find a box of old photographs that belonged to the previous residents. While researching the previous family's history, they learn of a little girl named Doris Zander who went missing, and whose mother was suspected in her disappearance. Laine visits Doris' sister, an old woman named Paulina, who is now committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. Paulina explains that her mother was a medium and used Doris as a vessel for the dead to speak through. Their mother went mad and sewed Doris' mouth shut before killing her. She tells Laine that there is a secret room in the house where Laine must find Doris' hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order for the girl to banish their mother. The remaining friends go back to the Galardi house, where Laine finds Doris' corpse and cuts the stitches on her mouth. Doris' mother's spirit protests, but Doris' spirit appears and chases away the ghost of her mother. Pete becomes possessed and is killed in his home, appearing as a soulless ghost with his mouth stitched up.

Laine revisits Paulina and realizes that the old woman intentionally lied. Doris was the evil entity all along and her mother was trying to stop the friends from summoning her.<ref>The prequel film ''[[Ouija: Origin of Evil]]'' reveals that the spirit inhabiting the body of Doris is actually that of a Police man named Marcus.</ref> The Morris's grandmother, Nona, advises the sisters to destroy Doris' body and the Ouija board at the same time. Doris' ghost throws Trevor into a swimming pool covered with a plastic canopy, trapping and drowning him. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, where Doris captures Sarah and prepares to sew her mouth shut. Laine plays the Ouija board alone to draw the spirit's attention. Doris starts possessing Laine, but Deb's ghost appears to help Laine defeat Doris. Sarah throws Doris' body into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board. The [[paranormal activity]] stops. Later, Laine finds that the [[planchette]] has mysteriously appeared back at her home in her bedroom, and as she sees through the planchette the film ends.

===Filming===
Principal photography began mid December 2013 in Los Angeles wrapped at the end of January 2014

Although shooting officially wrapped in January 2014,<ref name="four-cast" /> poor test screenings resulted in re-shoots occurring in June,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FlickGeeks/videos/547987261973885/|work=facebook.com|title=New Ouija Trailer|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref> which, according to Olivia Cooke, resulted in half the film being re-shot. With the reshoots, [[Lin Shaye]] was added to the film to play a newly written character, Erin Moriarty's character was removed from the film entirely, and new plot points were added or changed entirely. The most notable of changes included the character of Doris Zander's physical appearance changing from that of a burnt looking girl to a rotting, decomposing girl with stitches in her mouth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/olivia-cooke-ouija-bates-motel-season-3-interview/|work=collider.com|title=Olivia Cooke Ouija Bates Motel season 3 interview|accessdate=December 1, 2014}}</ref>

===Home media===
''Ouija'' was released in the US on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on February 3, 2015.<ref>http://www.dvdsreleasedates.com/movies/6964/ouija</ref>

==Novelization==
The film was novelized by Katharine Turner. The novel was released on September 16, 2014.<ref name="novelization"/>

The plot of the novel differs from the movie in many notable ways, containing an additional flashback sequence at the beginning of the book which occurs two months before Debbie dies, giving a more in-depth backstory to the main characters. Laine's father has a larger role in the novel, snapping at Sarah after she tries to sneak out of the house. There is an additional scene in the novel after the group uses the Ouija board for a second time where Sarah and Laine have a heartfelt conversation at the dinner table. There are longer sequences with Laine's grandmother Nona as well.

The message "Hi friend" from Doris in the novel appears as "Hi frend". When Isabelle approaches her car after work, instead of finding "Hi friend" written in the condensation on the inside of her car, she finds a hand print.

The characters of Pete and Isabelle also die in different ways in the novel. Pete, after seeing Doris' spirit in his room and becoming possessed, slits his wrists with an X-ACTO knife. Isabelle, after being possessed by Doris, sits in her bathtub with a plugged-in hair dryer, electrocuting herself.

The finale of the novel differs greatly from the film. Sarah is not trapped in the altar room with Doris' spirit as in the film, but rather Laine crawls down the passageway into the altar to get Doris' body. While Laine is in the passageway, Sarah is left by the furnace with the Ouija board where Doris manipulates Sarah's arm and has it twist in unnatural positions while touching the planchette. Doris uses Sarah's arm to spell out "D-I-E-F-R-E-N-D" on the board. After throwing Doris' body into the furnace with the Ouija board, Doris appears in spirit form as a normal girl, where her mother joins her. The two hold hands and disappear. Laine suddenly notices Debbie's spirit in the room. She says "Hi friend" to Laine. Laine asks if she is dead, but Debbie tells her everything is okay. Debbie says goodbye to Laine, and Laine falls unconscious.

The epilogue to the novel mirrors the film, with Laine finding the planchette in her room.

==Prequel==
{{main|Ouija: Origin of Evil}}
Throughout January 2015, reports of a sequel were announced. In February 2015, it was confirmed the film was in development and had no release date; [[Jason Blum]] stated "We're a ways away ..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/ouija-2-news-update-producer-jason-blum-talks-sequel-development-133605/|title='Ouija 2' Plot Spoilers, Rumors: Producer Jason Blum Talks Sequel Development|last=Donguines|first=Arvin|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=February 7, 2015|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}</ref> In April 2015, it was announced that the sequel would be released on October 21, 2016. [[Mike Flanagan (director)|Mike Flanagan]] would direct and co-write the sequel with his ''[[Oculus (film)|Oculus]]'' co-writer Jeff Howard. The film would be produced by [[Michael Bay]], Brad Fuller, [[Andrew Form]], [[Jason Blum]], Brian Goldner, and Stephen Davis. [[Annalise Basso]] and Kaylee Procter would star in the sequel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/ouija-sequel-october-2016-universal-jason-blum-1201418623/|title=‘Ouija 2′ Set For October 2016; Jason Blum Back as Producer - Deadline|first=Denise|last=Petski|work=Deadline|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/ouija-2-mike-flanagan-annalise-basso-1201570455|title='Ouija 2' Lands Director Mike Flanagan, Actress Annalise Basso|publisher=Variety|last=Kroll|first=Justin|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> It was then announced that ''[[Ouija: Origin of Evil]]'' would serve as a [[prequel]] to the first film. It was released in October 2016, and unlike its predecessor, it gained far more positive reviews.

==Unofficial sequels==
Film media distributor Cinedigm has released two unofficial sequels. The film "Charlie, Charlie" was released in 2017 on DVD with the title "[[Ouija 3: The Charlie Charlie Challenge]]" and the 2015 Hong Kong horror film "Are You Here" was released in 2018 on DVD with the title "[[Ouija 4]]". This deceptive marketing was made to fool the public into believing these were sequels to two official Blumhouse films.
