'''''Geethaanjali''''' (also spelt '''''Geethanjali''''') is a 2013 Indian [[Malayalam]]-language [[horror film]] directed by [[Priyadarshan]], and written by Abhilash Nair, with dialogue by [[Dennis Joseph]]. It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the 1993 film ''[[Manichitrathazhu]]'' with its plot loosely based on the novel ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]''. [[Mohanlal]] reprised his role from the original, while [[Suresh Gopi]] appeared in a cameo role. It also features [[Nishan (actor)|Nishan]], [[Keerthi Suresh]], Swapna Menon, [[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]], [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]], and [[K. B. Ganesh Kumar]]. The film was produced and released by Seven Arts; psychologist Dr. Sunny Joseph (Mohanlal) arrives in an old mansion to treat Anjali (Keerthy), who is haunted by her deceased twin sister Geetha (Keerthy), and investigates paranormal activities occurring there.

The film was originally planned to be shot in [[3D film|3D]] and [[Auro-3D]] formats but this was abandoned because the technology was time-consuming and only a few theatres in [[Kerala]] were equipped with [[Auro 11.1|Auro]] sound equipment at that time. [[Principal photography]] commenced on 6 July 2013 at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and was completed in September. Most of the filming took place at the [[Chitranjali Studio]] and in and around Thiruvananthapuram. The [[cinematographer]] was [[Tirru]] and editing was done by [[T. S. Suresh]].

''Geethaanjali'' was released worldwide on 14 November 2013; it was a critical and commercial failure, critics said its screenplay was an imitation of the 2007 [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] film ''[[Alone (2007 film)|Alone]]'', which itself was based on [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[Elephants Can Remember]]'', the novel that this movie is based on. Mohanlal's performance, the cinematography and the graphics received praise.

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=February 2016}} 
Anjali's ([[Keerthi Suresh]]) twin sister Geetha (Keerthi Suresh) has committed suicide. Anjali is betrothed to Anoop ([[Nishan (actor)|Nishan]]), a member of a prominent family. When her mother falls from a terrace and is paralysed, Anjali and Anoop go to her house in [[Arackal]]. Once there, the spirit of Geetha starts to haunt Anjali, which physically disturbs her. Within days of a series of horrifying incidents, Dr. Sunny Joseph ([[Mohanlal]]) arrives to treat Anjali and to help her out of her crisis. Because the house was haunted, the family buys a new house, and the future owner Vasu ([[K. B. Ganesh Kumar|Ganesh Kumar]]) claims that he had seen Geetha in a car and wrote down the number on a file. He says that he could give it to them the next day. But Vasu gets a phone call from Geetha's spirit asking him to meet her in the church next morning. He goes there and calls Dr. Sunny for help, but Vasu gets killed before he could help him. Sunny then spots a car driving out of the church and follows it, but the killer already got out of the car before he could spot him.
Anjali  tells Sunny that Geeta had suicided as she had fallen in love with Anoop as well.

Gruesome events follow that, including the death of Thambichayan ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]), a caretaker at Arakal. Dr. Sunny tells everyone that the ghost haunting Anjali is just a psychological effect and not real. For some reason he tries to postpone their marriage, but in vain. On their engagement day, Sunny grabs Anoop and shoves him to his car. He drives to a small graveyard. He tells Anoop that the so-called Anjali is actually Geetha, who has a criminal nature.

there is then a flaskback. Anjali and Anoop fall in love with each other, but Geetha mistakes that Anoop loves her. She loves Anoop. She was angry that Anoop is going to marry Anjali and not her, and eventually killed Anjali during an argument at a beach. Dr. Sunny shows Anjali's grave to Anoop and tells him the whole truth about her. The feeling of guilt in her mind led to seeing Anjali wherever she goes and all horrible incidents that happened were just an illusion seen by Geetha. Vasu was killed by Thambichayan, the only person who knew this apart from Geetha and her mother. It is also shown that it was actually Geetha who accidentally shoved her mother off the terrace, when she was told that Anjali's spirit was in the house. Thambi is later killed by Geetha so that there is no way anyone could find out the truth. He was still not sure, so he had tried to postpone their marriage until he had collected enough evidence to tell them.

Hearing this, Anoop storms into Anjali's house and accused her of taking Anjali's name. She tries to kill Anoop when he says he doesn't want her anymore. Fortunately, Sunny breaks into the house and rescues Anoop, but she takes a gun and aims at them. But an image of Anjali's spirit appears in Geetha's mind (on a mirror), and prevents her from shooting Anoop. Geetha is killed by a fire in the house and Anjali's 'spirit' watches over Geetha while she is dying.

Later, the grave of Geetha is built alongside Anjali's, and Anoop, his family and Thankappan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]) thanks Sunny for helping them.

== Reception ==

===Critical reaction===
Veeyen of ''Nowrunning.com'' rated the film two stars out of five, and said, "Very rarely does the film rise above the conventions of a horror film that seem to be stuck on its back like a duct tape. No amount of incredible performances or stunning cinematography by Thiru can save 'Geethanjali' from collapsing into another cluttered film that bites the dust". He also said the story is similar to that of ''[[Chaarulatha]]'' (2012).<ref name=review1>{{cite web|title=Geethanjali Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204015455/http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/13439/malayalam/geethanjali/4467/review.htm|archivedate=4 February 2015|url=http://www.nowrunning.com/movie/13439/malayalam/geethanjali/4467/review.htm|publisher=Nowrunning.com|author=Veeyen|date=15 November 2013|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref> ''[[Sify.com]]'' criticised the film's similarity to the 2007 [[Thai film]] ''[[Alone (2007 film)|Alone]]'' and its [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]]-[[Cinema of Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] bilingual remake film ''[[Chaarulatha]]'' (2012).

Aswin J.
