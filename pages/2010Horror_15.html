==Reception==
The New York Times reviewed the film as "Airless, tortuous and broody to a fault", explaining that "there are lots of reasons why horror filmmakers keep checking their characters into seedy motels... but not even the Bates Motel itself could save the mess that is 'Beneath the Dark.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/movies/05beneath.html|first=Jeannette|last=Catsoulis|date=November 4, 2010|publisher=New York Times|title=A Motel Stay Leads to Creepy Happenings}}</ref>

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that it was "defeated by the convoluted story line, sluggish pacing and a general 'been there, seen that' feeling induced by the proceedings. Although boasting strongly atmospheric visuals and effective performances, [it] never rises above a general level of murkiness."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/beneath-dark-film-review-44800|title=Beneath the Dark – Film Review|date=11/12/2010|first=Frank|last=Scheck|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>
