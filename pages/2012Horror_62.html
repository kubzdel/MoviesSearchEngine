The film performed disappointingly at the United States box office, but did well in foreign markets. The film received mixed reviews; critics praised its visual style and consistent humor but felt it lacked a focused or substantial plot and developed characters.<ref name="rotten tomatoes" /> The film was produced by [[Richard D. Zanuck]], who died two months after its release. It featured the final appearance of original series actor [[Jonathan Frid]], who died shortly before its release. It was the 200th film appearance of actor [[Christopher Lee]], and his fifth appearance in a Burton film.

==Plot==
In 1760, the Collins family moves from [[Liverpool, England]] to [[Maine]] and establishes the fishing town [[Collinsport]], where they build their estate, [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]].

When he first arrives, the young son Barnabas ([[Johnny Depp]]), meets the young Angelique Bouchard ([[Eva Green]]), who instantly becomes besotted with him. Angelique's witch mother who was with her at that time warned her of socialising with people of noble birth. This, however, did not stop Angelique from following the family for many years, hoping to be loved by Barnabas, but to no avail.

By 1776, Barnabas, now a grown man, falls in love with a young woman named [[Josette du Pres]] ([[Bella Heathcote]]), scorning Angelique who was now working as a maid in his household. Turning to [[black magic]], Angelique curses the Collins family, first killing Barnabas's parents ([[Ivan Kaye]] and [[Susanna Cappellaro]]) in an assumed accident, then by enchanting Josette to leap to her death off a cliff called Widow's Hill. In a fit of grief, Barnabas attempts to leap to his own death but fails, as Angelique curses him to the [[Immortality|immortal]] life of a [[vampire]]. When he still rejects her advances, she turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a coffin.

In 1972 (that is, 196 years later), a young Maggie Evans (also Bella Heathcote), under the assumed identity of "[[Victoria Winters]]", applies for a job as a [[governess]] at Collinwood and meets with the current reclusive [[matriarch]], [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]). Her nephew David ([[Gulliver McGrath|Gully McGrath]]), for whom Victoria will be caring, believes his mother, who drowned in a boating accident, still visits him. Victoria does not divulge that since her young age she, too, can see [[ghost]]s.

After meeting with David, his live-in [[psychiatrist]] [[Julia Hoffman]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), his father Roger ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), and Elizabeth's rebellious daughter Carolyn ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), Victoria is hired by Elizabeth. That night, Victoria sees the ghost of Josette, who warns that "he's coming" before disappearing after falling from a [[chandelier]].

Elsewhere, a group of construction workers dig up Barnabas's coffin and inadvertently free him. After satiating his bloodthirst of 196 years and shocked by the modern times he finds himself in, Barnabas returns to Collinwood, and [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the [[groundskeeper]], Willie Loomis ([[Jackie Earle Haley]]), as his personal [[Renfield]], and introduces himself to the family as a "distant relative". Elizabeth believes him to be a con-man until he reveals hidden riches buried in a secret passage within the house, whereas Elizabeth thought the family to be destitute. After realising who and what Barnabas is, she asks him to keep it a secret to protect the children of his true nature, passing him off as his own descendant, "Barnabas Collins III".

During his breakfast with his newfound family, Barnabas is instantly smitten with Victoria when he meets her as she resembles Josette. Resolved to honorably win her heart, he seeks out Carolyn's advice on courting her. Angelique, now an immortal witch herself and Elizabeth's rival, learns of Barnabas' resurgence and visits him, informing him that she now has taken over Collinsport as a member of the upstanding community. In retaliation, Barnabas reopens the Collins [[Canning|Cannery]] family business and uses hypnosis to steal several of the fisherman crews who work for Angelique. As a result, she tries to buy him off. However, even after an episode of supernatural lust between the two, he rejects her offer. Meanwhile, Julia later discovers his identity by hypnotizing him and offers to cure his vampiric condition via blood transfusions.

After successfully restoring the family fortune and business, Barnabas decides to hold a ball to reintroduce the family to the townsfolk with Carolyn suggesting that they make it a happening with musician [[Alice Cooper]] as the headliner. During the ball, Barnabas catches Roger stealing from guest's coats and later finds Victoria gazing out from a balcony. Feeling comfortable around him, Victoria confides to Barnabas that she's actually an escapee from the mental asylum where her parents had her confined since she was a child due to her powers. Meanwhile, Angelique makes a grand appearance in order to see Barnabas. When she catches him and Victoria kissing, she becomes even more embittered.

Motivated after Victoria reciprocated his feelings, Barnabas seeks out Julia (wishing even more desperately to be mortal again), only to find out that the latter has been using his blood to make herself immortal. Feeling betrayed, he drains her and dumps her seemingly dead body into the town bay with Willie's help. After catching Roger trying to break into the secret passage, Barnabas gives him a choice: to stay and be an exemplary father to David or to leave with enough money to live his thieving life elsewhere. Roger chooses the latter, anguishing David. Barnabas's true identity is finally revealed to the rest of the family and Victoria when he saves David from a falling [[disco ball]]. Victoria is scared by the revelation and runs away.

Upset, Barnabas barges into Angelique's office to demand her to release him from his curse, and while she offers him blood due to her knowing that Julia is no longer around to provide him blood transfusions, she also threatens to send Victoria off Widow's Hill, the same way she did to Josette, and offers him an ultimatum: Either become partners and lovers with her or be locked in a coffin again. With Barnabas rejecting the former, she proceeds to do the latter, this time placing him in the Collins Family [[Mausoleum]]. Shortly after, he is found and freed by David, alerted by his mother's ghost, and they return towards the mansion. Meanwhile, Angelique destroys the Collins Cannery and implicates Barnabas in the murders of Julia and all the people he had to feed on, turning the townsfolk against the family.

At the mansion, Barnabas and Elizabeth see the police, Angelique, and the angry mob approaching as Carolyn withdraws into the mansion. Willing to turn himself in as long as she goes along with him, Barnabas reveals his and Angelique's true natures in front of an angry mob and a fight ensues, pitting Barnabas and Elizabeth against Angelique. During the fight (following the mob's departure upon these revelations), Carolyn reveals to her family that she is a [[werewolf]] and joins her family in their battle against Angelique, but a fire later breaks out in the house. Ultimately, the ghost of David's mother (Josephine Butler) manages to hurl Angelique against the chandelier, which then falls to the ground, mortally wounding her as she starts to shatter. She reaches into her chest and literally offers her heart to Barnabas this time as it shatters as well, resulting in her death. Concerned for Victoria's well-being, Barnabas storms off to look for her as David informs him through his mother that she's headed towards Widow's Hill. As David asks Elizabeth what they will do now, Elizabeth says that they will do what they've always done as the Collins family: "Endure."

After catching up to Victoria at Widow's Hill, Barnabas stops her from leaping and refuses to turn her into a vampire to save her from eternal suffering as an immortal, despite her request. Touched, Victoria throws herself from its cliffs anyway, resulting in Barnabas leaping after her and biting her, so that she can survive the fall as a vampire. She awakens, asking him to call her Josette, and the two kiss passionately on the rocky shore.

The closing scene is at the bottom of the bay as Julia opens her eyes to her new immortal life.

==Cast==
* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Barnabas Collins]], an 18th-century [[vampire]] who awakens to the 20th century.<ref name="begins" /> While an [[Empathy|empathetic]] character aware of his sinister nature, Barnabas retains a vicious streak, never forgiving and relentless in the kill. His only loyalties to his family aside, he is a well-mannered man consistently trapped in the mindset of an 18th-century Englishman.
** Justin Tracy as Young Barnabas
* [[Eva Green]] as [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Bouchard]], a vengeful witch who plots a vendetta against Barnabas and his family.<ref name="begins" /> She wears a constantly false smile that resembles a smile of a [[Bisque doll|porcelain doll]] or glass figure, her face becomes cracked either when damaged or emotionally distraught, revealing a possibly hollow interior. She had spent two centuries using her immortal nature to ruin the Collins Family name and give herself more power, posing as five generations of the "Bouchard Women".
** [[Raffey Cassidy]] as Young Angelique
* [[Bella Heathcote]] as [[Victoria Winters]], David's governess and Barnabas' love interest.<ref name="begins" /> Heathcote also plays the role of [[Josette du Pres]]. Victoria and [[Maggie Evans]]' roles in the original series were combined in the film, with Maggie choosing to adopt the name of Victoria after seeing a poster for winter sports in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] while on the train to Collinsport. As a child, Victoria was sent to a mental hospital by her parents for possessing the ability to see and speak to ghosts, only to escape and find refuge with the Collins Family. She is from New York and has a very kind nature. She is mutually attracted to Barnabas, but initially recoils after discovering his true nature. After being cursed by Angelique, she ultimately decides that the only way for her and Barnabas to be together is for him to turn her into a vampire as well.
** Alexia Osborne as Young Victoria
* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]], the family matriarch.<ref name="begins" /> Stern and strict, but loyal and devoted to her family, Elizabeth cares for every member of the household and tends to help them through their personal trials. To "endure" as they always have, she isn't afraid to stand up for herself.
* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Roger Collins, Elizabeth's "[[wikt:ne'er-do-well|ne'er-do-well]]" brother.<ref name="begins" /> Larcenous and greedy, Roger often takes advantage of what he can through theft, trickery or bribery. When Barnabas catches him snooping around for the secret passage, he offers Roger a choice, either stay at Collinwood and be an exemplary father to his son David, or leave with the money to live on. The selfish man chooses the latter, hurting David at his departure.
* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Julia Hoffman|Dr. Julia Hoffman]], the family's live-in psychiatrist, hired to deal with David and his belief in ghosts.<ref name="begins" /> Somewhat vain and losing to her aging, she takes it upon herself to receive transfusions from Barnabas (under the guise of trying to cure him). She is often drunk or taking pills. Barnabas woos her into having a crush on him, often taking advantage of his naive nature without regarding the possible consequence of betraying him.
* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[Willie Loomis]], the manor's caretaker.<ref name="begins" /> He becomes Barnabas' servant through [[hypnosis]]; he retains his own mindset, but follows his master's will instantly.
* [[Chloë Grace Moretz]] as [[Carolyn Stoddard]], Elizabeth's rebellious teenage daughter.<ref name="begins" /> She offers Barnabas advice on love, music, and insight into the current era. She wants to run away to New York when she turns 16, but her mother constantly forbids it. She also turns out to be a werewolf, as she was bitten by a werewolf sent by Angelique when she was a baby.

==Production==
In July 2007, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired film rights for the gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' from the estate of its creator [[Dan Curtis]]. [[Johnny Depp]] had a childhood obsession with ''Dark Shadows'', calling it a "dream" to portray Barnabas Collins, and ended up persuading Burton to direct.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Fleming | first=Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117969246 | title=Depp lights up 'Dark Shadows' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 26, 2007 }}</ref> The project's development was delayed by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].

''Dark Shadows'' has received mixed <!--Both RT (5.3/10) and MC (55/100) scores are considered as mixed-->reviews from film critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 37%, based on 233 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "The visuals are top notch but Tim Burton never finds a consistent rhythm, mixing campy jokes and gothic spookiness with less success than other Johnny Depp collaborations."<ref name="rotten tomatoes">{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark-shadows-2010/|title=''Dark Shadows''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|work=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dark-shadows|title=Dark Shadows Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More - Metacritic|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] said, "[The film] offers wonderful things, but they aren't what's important. It's as if Burton directed at arm's length, unwilling to find juice in the story." Ebert later noted that "Much of the amusement comes from Depp's reactions to 1970s pop culture," eventually concluding that the film "begins with great promise, but then the energy drains out," giving it two and a half stars out of four.<ref name="Ebert">{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120509/REVIEWS/120509983 |title=Dark Shadows :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.com, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 9, 2012}}</ref> [[Manohla Dargis]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that it "isn't among Mr. Burton's most richly realized works, but it's very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its [[Melancholia|lugubrious]] source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent," and opined in a mostly positive review that Burton's "gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power."<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/movies/johnny-depp-stars-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows.html?smid=tw-nytimesmovies&seid=auto |title=Johnny Depp Stars in Tim Burton's 'Dark Shadows' - NYTimes.com |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=Manohla |last=Dargis |date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave the film a mixed two and a half stars, claiming, "After a fierce and funny start, ''Dark Shadows'' simply spins its wheels," and adding that "the pleasures of ''Dark Shadows'' are frustratingly hit-and-miss. In the end, it all collapses into a spectacularly gorgeous heap."<ref name="RS">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dark-shadows-20120510 |title=Dark Shadows - Movie Reviews |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref> In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Ann Hornaday dismissed the film, awarding it just one and a half stars, explaining that "Burton's mash-up of post-'60s [[kitsch]] and modern-day knowingness strikes a chord that is less self-aware than fatally self-satisfied. ''Dark Shadows'' doesn't know where it wants to dwell: in the eerie, subversive [[Umbra|penumbra]] suggested by its title or in playful, go-for-broke [[Camp (style)|camp]]."<ref name="TWP">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/dark-shadows-an-imax-3d-experience,1229895/critic-review.html |title=Critic Review for Dark Shadows: An IMAX 3D Experience on washingtonpost.com |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}</ref>

[[Richard Corliss]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pointed out that "[Burton]'s affection is evident, and his homage sometimes acute," and reasoned: "All right, so Burton has made less a revival of the old show than a hit-or-miss parody pageant," but praised the star power of the film, relenting that "attention must be paid to movie allure, in a star like Depp and his current harem. Angelique may be the only [[Satanist]] among the women here, but they're all bewitching."<ref name="Time">{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/10/johnny-depp-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows-death-warmed-over/ |title=Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows: Death Warmed Over |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 10, 2012}}</ref> [[Peter Bradshaw]], in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', weighed the film in a mixed write-up, giving it three stars out of five, and pointing out his feeling that "the Gothy, jokey 'darkness' of Burton's style is now beginning to look very familiar; he has built his brand to perfection in the film marketplace, and it is smarter and more distinctive than a lot of what is on offer at the multiplex, but there are no surprises. There are shadows, but they conceal nothing."<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/10/dark-shadows-review |title=Dark Shadows – review |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |location=London |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |date=May 10, 2012}}</ref>

When Burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, "No. Because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. [The ending] had more to do with the soap opera structure of it."<ref name=radish/>
