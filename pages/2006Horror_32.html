'''''Bug''''' is a 2006 American-German [[Independent film|independent]] [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[William Friedkin]]. It stars [[Ashley Judd]], [[Michael Shannon]], and [[Harry Connick Jr.]] The screenplay by [[Tracy Letts]] is based on his 1996 [[Bug (play)|play of the same name]] in which a woman holed up in a rural Oklahoma motel becomes involved with a paranoid man obsessed with conspiracy theories about insects and the government. The film debuted at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]] before being purchased by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]], who released the film the following year in May 2007.

Friedkin and Letts similarly collaborated on the 2011 film ''[[Killer Joe (film)|Killer Joe]]''.

==Plot==
The film opens with a dead body in a strange looking room. We then meet Agnes White is a waitress at a [[gay bar]] living in a run-down motel in rural [[Oklahoma]]. Unable to move on from the disappearance of her son some years previously, she engages in drug and alcohol binges with her lesbian friend, R.C. Lately, she has been plagued by silent telephone calls that she believes are being made by her [[Domestic violence|abusive]] ex-husband, Jerry Goss, who has recently been released from prison.

One night, R.C. introduces Agnes to Peter Evans, a drifter who says he is a recently discharged soldier. Agnes and Peter reach out to each other out of loneliness, and start a relationship after Jerry visits Agnes. He convinces her that he was the subject of biological testing by the U.S. government while he was in the military, and says the anonymous phone calls she has been receiving were made by government agents in anticipation of his arrival. After they have sex, Peter tells Agnes that their room has become infested by bugs sent there by the government as part of their experiments.

Peter's movements and behavior become more erratic as he fights the bugs, invisible to the audience, that he claims are infesting his body. Agnes soon joins in this behavior. R.C tries to convince Agnes to leave Peter, and mentions that a man named Dr. Sweet is looking for him, but is sent away by Agnes after Peter has an episode. Over time, they isolate themselves from the outside world, sealing themselves in their room and covering it with [[flypaper]] and [[aluminum foil]] and lighting it with the glow from [[bug zapper]]s. Peter, believing that a colony of microscopic bugs was implanted in one of his teeth, tears it out of his head. Using a child's microscope, he says he sees the bugs in the remains of the crushed tooth, as does Agnes.

A Dr. Sweet arrives, and tells Agnes that Peter has escaped while under treatment at a [[mental institution]] and that delusions about insects are a known symptom of Peter's mental illness. Peter kills Sweet, telling Agnes that he was a robot sent by the government. Together, Peter and Agnes elaborate upon Peter's beliefs in a conspiracy, including that Agnes' son was kidnapped by the government to lead her and Peter to meeting and that each of them is infected with bugs that are meant to mate with one another and take over the world. In order to prevent this, Agnes and Peter douse each other in gasoline and set themselves on fire.

In the end credits, the audience sees the toys in Agnes and Peter's room completely intact, with no sign of the aluminium foil, and opening shot of the film with the body of Dr. Sweet, in the room covered with foil but undamaged by fire. Which shot, if any, shows "reality" is left unclear.

==Production==

===Settings===
Its set design was done by [[Franco-Giacomo Carbone]], the production designer of films such as ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' (2005) and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006).

Most of the film's action occurs in a seedy motel room. The scenario has three interconnected rooms â€” a bathroom, a [[kitchenette]] and a living room. At one point in the film, the room has several dozen [[Flypaper|fly strips]] hanging from the ceiling. At another point the entire room is covered from floor to ceiling in tinfoil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lectrosonics.com/US/Press-Releases/it-s-all-lectrosonics-wireless-for-william-friedkin-s-new-thriller-bug.html | title=It's All Lectrosonics Wireless for William Friedkin's New Thriller " Bug " |date=March 1, 2006|publisher=Lectrosonics|accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref> Friedkin has said the tinfoil was a nightmare to work with, because it had to be repaired constantly, and because it reflected everybody who was there, including the crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/1553/story |accessdate=May 26, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}</ref>
