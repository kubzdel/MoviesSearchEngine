==Plot==
Rachel, a beautiful young artist, is murdered at her secluded lakefront house by a group of soulless killers. Her brother Travis vows to punish her killers one by one - even if it costs him his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Guided by his sister's ghostly voice that commands him to take brutal revenge, Travis hunts down each of the killers and punishes them in gruesome fashion. Travis's conscience catches up with him, but his sister's voice and other circumstances push him into much more horrible circumstances than he is already in.
