== Reception ==

[[Bloody Disgusting]] praised the gore, criticized the screenplay and acting, and gave the film a final score of 3/5, concluding, "''Woensdag'' may not be a great movie but it sure is entertaining and it being a relatively short movie (75 minutes) helps keep the pace and our attention up".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/109465/woensdag-wednesday-5/|title = ''Woensdag (Wednesday)''|publisher = [[Archive.is]]|date = 24 June 2005|website = bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate = 26 April 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/LNUId|archivedate = 19 October 2014}} </ref> The acting, dialogue, story, and production values were all panned by Neerlands Filmdoek, which gave ''Woensdag'' a grade of 1½ while also conceding that, "Nevertheless, there is still something to enjoy for lovers who have no objection to these shortcomings; the film is never boring and has enough amusing horror moments, fitted with the necessary gore".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.nlfilmdoek.nl/dvd-blu-ray/dvd/woensdag-dvd-recensie/|title = ''Woensdag'' - DVD Review|last = Peters|first = Kasper|publisher = Neerlands Filmdoek|date = 12 October 2007|website = nlfilmdoek.nl|accessdate = 19 October 2014}} </ref> Top of the Flops gave ''Woensdag'' a similar commendation, noting that despite the drawbacks inherent in it being a "semi amateurish production" the film was still enjoyable as something "designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.totf.nl/movies/woensdag/|title = ''Woensdag''|publisher = Top of the Flops|date = 23 July 2007|website = totf.nl|accessdate = 11 November 2016}} </ref> Horror Neerlands, which gave the film a final grade of 2/5, panned the personality-less characters, the seemingly nonexistent script, and the slow start, but went on to admit that ''Woensdag'' did succeed at being "quite entertaining" and "still pretty fun" in spite of its flaws.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.horror.nl/recensies/woensdag/|title = ''Woensdag''|publisher = Horror Neerlands|date = 28 April 2011|website = horror.nl|accessdate = 26 April 2017}} </ref> The same score was awarded by Slasherpool, which summed ''Woensdag'' up with, "Disappointing [[Slasher film|slasher flick]] from the [[Netherlands]] which won't likely impress anyone who lives outside [[Holland]]. It's a very dull slasher and the concept has been done to death in several, much better flicks. It doesn't help that it's almost impossible to see what was going on for most of the movie either".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://slasherp.nexcess.net/htm/reviews/woensdag.htm|title = ''Woensdag''|last = Fred|first = Anthro|publisher = [[Internet Archive]]|website = slasherpool.starbase.se|accessdate = 26 April 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919090419/http://slasherp.nexcess.net:80/htm/reviews/woensdag.htm|archivedate = 19 September 2008}} </ref>
