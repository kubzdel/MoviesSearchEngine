'''''Insidious: Chapter 2''''' is a 2013 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[James Wan]]. It is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]],'' the second installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the fourth in terms of the series' in-story chronology. The film stars [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Rose Byrne]] reprising their roles as Josh and Renai Lambert, a husband and wife who seek to uncover the secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.

The film was released September 13, 2013. A [[prequel]] film, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'', was released on June 5, 2015.

== Plot ==
In 1986, Lorraine Lambert summons [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier to help her son Josh, who is being followed by the spirit of an old woman.  After investigating the house and encountering [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], Elise tells Lorraine that they must suppress Josh's [[astral projection]] abilities for his own safety.

Twenty-five years later, Renai Lambert is under questioning about the [[Insidious (film)|death of Elise]].  She is warned that if her husband Josh's fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elise's murder.  The Lambert family relocate to Lorraine's house as the investigation continues.  Renai and the others begin to experience strange, seemingly paranormal activity in the house.

Specs and Tucker visit Elise's house and discover a videotape of the 1986 investigation.  Upon reviewing it, they find someone standing behind Josh in the video.  The next morning, Dalton tells Renai that he has been having bad dreams involving a woman in a white dress; as well as hearing Josh talk to an unseen figure in the hallway.  Renai receives a call from the police stating that the fingerprints do not match Josh.  The woman in the white dress appears and attacks Renai.  Josh hears a voice urging him to kill his family.

Lorraine visits Specs and Tucker and they show her the tape, enhanced to show an adult Josh as the figure standing behind the young Josh.  They contact Elise's former colleague Carl, who attempts to contact Elise's spirit.  They are told to find answers at an abandoned hospital where Lorraine used to work as a doctor.  Upon arriving, Lorraine recounts the story of a patient named Parker Crane who was admitted for trying to castrate himself.  Two days later, Lorraine saw Parker in an elevator.  When Lorraine asked a nurse why Parker was out of his bed, the nurse explained that he had [[suicide|jumped to his death from the roof]] the day before.

Lorraine and the group go to the Crane family home where they find a secret room.  Inside they discover numerous corpses, a black wedding gown and newspaper clippings revealing Parker to be a killer referred to as "The Bride in Black" - who kidnapped and murdered young women while dressed as a woman himself.  Josh's body begins to slowly deteriorate and Renai realizes he is possessed.  Lorraine insists that they all get away from Josh.  Carl arrives to drug him, accompanied by Specs and Tucker who stay in the van, repeatedly shouting, "Quesadilla!" Carl deduces that Josh is possessed by Parker.  Parker begins to choke Carl to death.  Carl awakes in the spirit realm, where he meets the real Josh, who has revealed that he is stuck in the Further for a long time, and together they go into The Further.  Josh travels to Cali's room, where an evil spirit is approaching his daughter.  He struggles with the spirit but is overpowered.  Elise's spirit arrives and banishes the spirit from the house.  It is revealed that these actions are what triggered some of the mysterious events in the first film, as time moves [[Chronology|non-chronologically]] in the Further.

In the real world, Josh, who is possessed by Parker,  ambushes Lorraine and Renai.  Renai and the children escape to the basement.  Dalton voluntarily enters The Further to help his father.  In The Further, Josh, Carl, and Elise try to track Parker down by revisiting Josh in 1986, with the young Josh showing the adult Josh where to find him.  In Parker's house, the three witness Parker's mother, Michelle – the woman in the white dress – abusing him for acting like a male; and forcing him to dress and act like a girl.  Parker had killed his female victims at the behest of his mother's spirit.  Upon finding Michelle, she and Josh fight. Elise saves Josh and appears to destroy Michelle's spirit, which stops the possessed Josh from murdering his family in the real world.  Parker's ghost disappears.  Carl and Josh escape, only to find Dalton, who leads them back to the living world.  The Lambert family is finally reunited, with Josh and Dalton allowing themselves to once again have their memories suppressed by Carl.

Some time later, Specs and Tucker arrive at the house of a family whose daughter, Allison, is in an unexplained coma.  Unbeknownst to them, Elise's spirit enters.  She hears a crackling sound and gasps as she sees something standing in the shadows.

{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote="It’s a direct continuation from the end of the first film, so it’s the same characters, same actors coming back. But where the first movie plays like a classic haunted house film, the second one plays more like a domestic thriller with supernatural elements to it."|source=—Wan, on the shift in genre<ref name="LA" />}}

After the financial success of ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' In April 2011, discussions for a sequel soon followed. With producer [[Jason Blum]] insisting on the return of director [[James Wan]] and screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]], a treatment script did not arrive until nearly a year later. "As long as there was a chance that James and Leigh were gonna write the second movie and direct the second movie, I didn’t want to do it with someone else," said Blum. "They kept saying they might do it, they might not do it, which was why there’s quite a bit of time between the two movies."<ref>{{cite web|last=Nemiroff|first=Perri|title=‘Insidious Chapter 2’ Producer Talks Micro-Budget Horror & ‘Amityville: Lost Tapes’|url=http://screenrant.com/insidious-2-interview-jason-blum-amityville-lost-tapes/|publisher=Screen Rant|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref> On February 2, 2012, it was announced that director [[James Wan]] and screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]] were in talks to return for the sequel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Horror Hit 'Insidious' to Get Sequel|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/insidious-sequel-rose-byrne-james-wan-leigh-whannell-286790|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=February 2, 2012}}</ref>

While promoting ''[[The Conjuring]]'' (2013) at [[New York Comic Con]] in October 2012, Wan described how he and Whannell were working closely on developing the story and the script for the follow up to ''Insidious'', explaining to [[ShockTilYouDrop.com]], "I think the sequel to ''Insidious'' is kind of my reaction to ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' where for my own reason I wasn't as involved in the sequels, and so I felt with ''Insidious'', think it would be good to shepherd it and keep it more in track to the version I had when I made the first film so that it doesn't detour too far."<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=NYCC Exclusive: James Wan & Patrick Wilson on Insidious 2|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/170453-nycc-exclusive-james-wan-a-patrick-wilson-on-insidious-2|work=[[Crave Online]]|publisher=[[ShockTilYouDrop.com]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=October 14, 2012}}</ref>

When asked about the return of the two characters, Whannell explained, "There was this hatred that spewed out from fans saying 'I hated those guys! They sucked!

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' began on January 15, 2013, in Los Angeles.<ref name="HR" /> Having a slightly higher production budget than its predecessor, the film was captured over the course of 25 shooting days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Insidious Chapter 2 - Q&A with Jason Blum, Leigh Whannell, Patrick Wilson, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey and James Wan|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/67172/insidious-chapter-2-qa-jason-blum-leigh-whannell-patrick-wilson-lin-shaye-barbara-hershey|publisher=Dead Central|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 30, 2013}}</ref> A bulk of the film was shot at a house in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles]],<ref name="SetVisit" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Insidious: Chapter 2 Filming in Highland Park|url=http://highlandparkgringos.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/insidious-chapter-2-filming-in-highland-park/|work=The Gringos of Highland Park|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=February 15, 2013}}</ref> which served as the location of Lorraine Lambert's house. Another location used for filming was the former [[Linda Vista Community Hospital]], which was redressed as a hospital setting and used for the construction of interior sets (including recreations of sets from the first film).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Further Hauntings|journal=[[Film Journal International]]|date=September 2013|volume=116|issue=9|page=12|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref><ref name="BD">{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Evan|title=[Special Report] Getting Answers And Escaping Ghosts On The Set Of ‘Insidious Chapter 2′!!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3235010/special-report-getting-answers-and-escaping-ghosts-on-the-set-of-insidious-chapter-2/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 29, 2013}}</ref> "I’ve never shot in Linda Vista," said Wan about the location. "It's kind of funny because Leigh and I have always heard so much about it. For research on the first one [Leigh] came here to do a bit of ghost-hunting. And I think a lot of that inspired us when we needed a hospital set."<ref name="BD" />

=== Music ===
The [[Film score|musical score]] to ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' is composed by [[Joseph Bishara]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|title=James Wan Confirms Joseph Bishara Back As Composer For 'Insidious Chapter 2'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3204160/james-wan-confirms-joseph-bishara-back-as-composer-for-insidious-chapter-2/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=November 19, 2012}}</ref> who previously collaborated with director [[James Wan]] on the first installment as well as ''The Conjuring''. "Finding the right range and tone for the feeling is an important part," described Bishara on generating tension through sound. "James is very particular with sting placement along with Kirk, our editor on both ''Insidious'' films and ''Conjuring''. Silence can create a listening space, where rather than give you something else to listen to it enables you to hear things."<ref>{{cite web|last=Schweiger|first=Daniel|title=Interview with Joseph Bishara|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=11755|publisher=Film Music Magazine|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>
