==Plot==
<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. -->
The parents of twelve-year-old DJ Walters leave town for the weekend, leaving him in the care of his babysitter, Zee. DJ has been spying on his elderly neighbor Horace Nebbercracker, who confiscates any item landing in his yard. After DJ's best friend Charles "Chowder" loses his basketball on Nebbercracker's lawn, DJ is caught by Nebbercracker trying to recover it, but the enraged owner apparently suffers a heart attack and is taken away by an ambulance. That night, DJ receives phone calls from the house with no one on the other end. Eavesdropping on Zee's boyfriend Bones, DJ hears him tell Zee about losing his kite on Nebbercracker's lawn when he was a child and that Nebbercracker supposedly ate his wife. Later, Bones sees his kite in the doorway of Mr. Nebbercracker's house, but he is consumed by the house while retrieving it.

The next morning, a girl named Jenny Bennett is selling [[Halloween]] candy. DJ and Chowder see her going to Nebbercracker's house and rush out to catch her before she is eaten by it. Jenny calls the police but is not believed.
 
The trio seek advice from Reginald "Skull" Skulinski, a supposed expert on the supernatural. They learn that the house is a rare monster created when a human soul merges with a man-made structure, and that it can only be killed by destroying its heart. They conclude that the heart must be the furnace and Chowder provides a cold medicine-filled dummy that should cause the house to sleep long enough for them to douse the furnace. Police Officers Landers and Lester thwart their plan and they are arrested when Landers finds the cold medicine stolen from Chowder's father's pharmacy inside the dummy. When the officers go to examine the house, it eats them and the car in which DJ, Chowder and Jenny have been shut.

When the house falls asleep, the kids begin exploring. In the basement they find a collection of toys accumulated from Nebbercracker's lawn, as well as a door that opens to a shrine containing the body of Nebbercracker's wife, Constance the Giantess, encased in cement. The house realizes they are inside and attacks them. DJ, Chowder, and Jenny force the house to vomit them outside by grabbing its [[uvula]]. Nebbercracker arrives home alive, revealing that Constance's spirit is within the house and that he did not eat her but instead had given her some of the happiest times in her life. As a young man, he met Constance, then an unwilling member of a circus [[freak show]], and fell in love with her despite her [[obesity]]. After he helped her escape, they began building the house. One Halloween, as children tormented her due to her size, Constance tried chasing them away but lost her footing and fell to her death in the basement. Nebbercracker had finished the house, knowing it was what she would have wanted but, aware that Constance's spirit made the house come alive, he pretended to hate children so as to keep them away.

DJ tells Nebbercracker it is time to let Constance go, but the house overhears this. Enraged, it breaks free from its foundation and chases the group to a construction site. Nebbercracker attempts to distract the house so he can dynamite it, but the house notices and attacks him. Chowder fights it off with an [[excavator]] and DJ is given the dynamite. While Chowder distracts the house, DJ and Jenny climb to the top of a crane and DJ throws the dynamite into the chimney causing the house to explode. The trio then see Nebbercracker with Constance's [[ghost]] before she fades away. DJ apologizes to Nebbercracker for the loss of his house and wife, but Nebbercracker thanks the kids for freeing him and his wife from being trapped for 45 years. That night, children in their Halloween costumes are lined up at the site of the house, where DJ, Chowder and Jenny help return the toys to their owners. Jenny's mother picks her up and DJ and Chowder go trick-or-treating, which they previously felt they were too old for. Those who were eaten by the house emerge from the basement.

==Production==
The film was shot using [[performance capture]], in which the actors performed the characters' movement while linked to sensors, a process pioneered by [[Robert Zemeckis]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lostintheplot.com/blog/?p=47 | title=The Animation of Monster House | work=Lost in the Plot | accessdate=2007-06-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141635/http://www.lostintheplot.com/blog/?p=47 | archivedate=2007-10-08 | df= }}</ref> A [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[3-D film|3-D]] version of the film was created and had a limited special release in digital 3-D stereo along with the "flat" version.  It was released in approximately 200 theaters equipped for new [[REAL D Cinema]] digital 3-D stereoscopic projection. The process was not based on film, but was purely digital. Since the original source material was "built" in virtual 3-D, it created a very rich stereoscopic environment. For the film's release, the studio nicknamed it ''Imageworks 3D''.<ref>For more info on the 3D technology used for ''Sony ImageWorks Monster House'', visit: www.reald.com</ref>

==Reception==

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Monster House'' welcomes kids and adults alike into a household full of smart, monstrous fun."<ref name="RT">{{rotten-tomatoes|monster_house|Monster House}}</ref>

[[Ian Freer]], writing for ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', gave the film 4 out of 5 stars with the verdict, "A kind of ''[[The Goonies|Goonies]]'' for the Noughties, ''Monster House'' is a visually dazzling thrill ride that scales greater heights through its winning characters and poignantly etched emotions. A scary, sharp, funny movie, this is the best kids’ flick of the year so far."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=10518 | title=Review by Ian Freer (Empire) | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref> Jane Boursaw of ''[[Common Sense Media]]'' also gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote, "This is one of those movies where all the planets align: a top-notch crew (director Gil Kenan; executive producers Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis), memorable voices that fit the characters perfectly; and a great story, ingenious backstory, and twisty-turny ending."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/movie-reviews/monster-house | title=Review by Jane Boursaw (Common sense Media) | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref> Roger Moore of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' wrote, "This ''Monster House'' is a real fun house. It's a 3-D animated kids' film built on classic gothic horror lines, a jokey, spooky ''Goonies'' for the new millennium." He also gave it 4 out of 5 stars.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/movies/orl-db-moviereviews-searchresults,0,3279701,results.formprofile?turbine_cdb_lib__cdb_01_txt=Monster%20House&Find+it!=Submit+Query | title=Review by Roger Moore (Orlando Sentinel) | accessdate=January 1, 2013}}</ref> Scott Bowles of ''[[USA Today]]'' observed, "The movie treats children with respect.

O. Scott]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' commented, "One of the spooky archetypes of childhood imagination — the dark, mysterious house across the street — is literally brought to life in “Monster House,” a marvelously creepy animated feature directed by Gil Kenan."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/movies/21mons.html?_r=0 | title=Review by A.

Dissenting critics included [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', who praised director Gil Kenan as "a talent to watch" but berated the "internal logic [that] keeps changing.... DJ's parents are away, and the house doesn't turn monstrous in front of his teenage babysitter, Zee. But it does turn monstrous in front of her boyfriend, Bones. It doesn't turn monstrous in front of the town's two cops until, in another scene, it does."<ref>[http://filmjournal.com/filmjournal/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002877008 Monster House<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, "Alert "[[Harry Potter]]" fans will notice the script shamelessly lifts the prime personality traits of [[J. K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]]'s three most important young characters for its lead trio: Tall, dark-haired, serious-minded DJ is [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]], semi-dufus Chowder is [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] and their new cohort, smarty-pants prep school redhead Jenny (Spencer Locke), is [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]].... [I]t is a theme-park ride, with shocks and jolts provided with reliable regularity. Across 90 minutes, however, the experience is desensitizing and dispiriting and far too insistent."<ref>{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Todd|title=Monster House|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117931010?refcatid=31|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=Variety|date=4 July 2006}}</ref>
