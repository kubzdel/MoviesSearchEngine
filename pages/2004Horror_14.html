When a British tourist is among the girls murdered, policeman John Brennan (Cunningham) is assigned the case and quickly teams up with Italian detective Anna Mari (Rocca).

== Critical reception ==

''The Card Player'' received a negative response from critics.

Though it's based on a promisingly outrageous premise [...] the film unfolds as a tired, thoroughly conventional police procedural that might as well be titled ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI: Roma]]''."<ref>{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=Dave |date=6 October 2004 |title=The Game Is Poker; The Stakes Are Lives |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/movies/06card.html?_r=1&ex=1128657600&en=d03ea2c9a522bd18&ei=5083&partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> [[AllRovi|AllMovie]]'s review was unfavorable, writing, "''The Card Player'' offers a fair amount of suspense and at least one memorable [[setpiece|set piece]], but for those even remotely familiar with Argento's canon, there's the feeling that it's all been done before – and handled with much more style and confidence."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-card-player-v301242/review |title=The Card Player - Review - AllMovie |last=Buchanan |first=Jason |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> [[Maitland McDonagh]] also gave the film a negative review, criticizing the screenplay for being "perfunctory" and for going "to so little trouble to hide the killer's identity that even inattentive viewers will know who's to blame long before the police figure it out."<ref name=McDonagh>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/movies/the-card-player/review/137669/ |title=The Card Player - Review - TV Guide |accessdate=19 September 2016 |author=McDonagh, Maitland |date=2004 |work=TV Guide }}</ref>
