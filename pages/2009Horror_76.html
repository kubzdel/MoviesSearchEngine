Jordan Harris and Andrew Schrader both attended [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], where Harris did honors art studio work, and Schrader was a film and media studies major.  The university did not offer a film program in terms of production, so Schrader focused on film history, theory, and analysis.  As the writer/director team was leaving college they decided that it was either make a film or "settle" for a mundane job within the film industry. On the afternoon of their graduation from college, they traveled to [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] to begin pre-production on creating a 1970s style acid movie about Satanists.  The film was shot on locations in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Lakehead, California|Lakehead]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Ramona, California|Ramona]], and [[Santa Barbara, California]].  The film was created on a low budget over a two-year period,<ref name=fatallyyours1>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatally-yours.com/interviews/interview-with-fever-night-writerdirector-andrew-schrader/ |title=Interview With Fever Night Writer/Director Andrew Schrader |work=Fatally-Yours |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217090731/http://www.fatally-yours.com/interviews/interview-with-fever-night-writerdirector-andrew-schrader/ |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>  and had its world premiere on July 24, 2009 in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losangeles.com/indie-acid-fright-flick-fever-night-aka-band-of-satanic-outsiders-e641631 |title=Indie "Acid" Fright Flick - Fever Night aka Band of Satanic Outsiders World Premiere |work=LosAngeles.com |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713233158/http://www.losangeles.com/indie-acid-fright-flick-fever-night-aka-band-of-satanic-outsiders-e641631 |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>

''[[Film Threat]]'' found potential in the film, writing, "There is a great film in the first half of Jordan Harris and Andrew Schrader's ''Fever Night''", making special note that "the film's set up is brilliant", but they felt the potential was not fully met.<ref name=filmthreat>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/11864/ |title=''Fever Night'' review |last=Hall |first=Phil |date=August 31, 2009 |work=[[Film Threat]] |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref>  In a positive review, Quiet Earth wrote, "There's enough material, visually and semantically, in there to get you brain fried and scrambled, and leave you with a stupid contented face for hours."<ref name=quietearth>{{cite web|url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2010/06/14/Review-of-FEVER-NIGHT-aka-BAND-OF-SATANIC-OUTSIDERS |title=''Fever Night'' review |last=Ferret |first=Crystal |date=June 14, 2010 |work=[[Quiet Earth]] |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref> ''Fatally-Yours'' stated that they were so impressed with the film that they were initially at a loss for words and found it difficult to express the emotions engendered after having watched it.<ref name=fatallyyours2>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatally-yours.com/horror-reviews/fever-night-2009/ |title=''Fever Nights aka Band of Santanic Outsiders'' review |work=Fatally-Yours |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217052107/http://www.fatally-yours.com/horror-reviews/fever-night-2009/ |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df= }}</ref> 

''[[Fangoria]]'' wrote that the film's subtitle, ''Band of Satanic Outsiders'' was a favorite that "howls that this film is full of fun Mephistopilean escapades!".<ref name=Fangoria>{{cite news |last=McKendry |first=Bekah |title=Catch satanic "FEVER": Win the DVD! |url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/home/all-news/7051-catch-satanic-fever-win-the-dvd |accessdate=August 11, 2012 |newspaper=[[Fangoria]] |date=May 10, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69EQnVQxU?url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/home/all-news/7051-catch-satanic-fever-win-the-dvd |archivedate=July 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>  The ''Movies Made Me'' reviewer stated that he was "never big on the overly psychedelic style of film", but that the trailer "looked like it had a lot of fun to offer" and after having watched the film he found no reason to regret having done so, as the psychedelic aspects were selectively used.  Though he stated the acting was better than expected, he faulted the film's pacing in the last 30 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviesmademe.com/movie/review/2197 |title=''Fever Night AKA Band Of Satanic Outsiders'' review |date=December 14, 2009 |work=Movies Made Me |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref>  ''10,000 Bullets'' wrote that, from a production standpoint, "just about every aspect of Fever Night is pitch perfect. The direction is stylish, the film's ambient sounds capes are superbly realized and the acting fare exceeded my expectations," but by the film's finale, it began "to lose its way".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://10kbullets.com/reviews/f/fever-night-aka-band-of-satanic-outsiders/ |title=''Fever Night'' (aka Band of Satanic Outsiders) review |last=Boer |first=Michael Den |date=August 4, 2010 |work=10.000 Bullets |accessdate=13 October 2010}}</ref>
