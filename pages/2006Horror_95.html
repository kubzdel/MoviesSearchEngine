'''''Hillside Cannibals''''' is a 2006 [[United States|American]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Leigh Scott]] and produced by [[The Asylum]]. The film is a [[mockbuster]] of the film ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', another film released around the same month, but its plot also incorporates elements from other films, including ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' and ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]''.

==Plot==

In the year 1606, [[Sawney Bean]] ([[Leigh Scott]]), a ruthless psychopath, earned a notoriety as the world's most brutal serial killer, predating [[Jack the Ripper]] and [[William T. Anderson|Bloody Bill]] by several hundred years. In life, Sawney was a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]], who captured his victims and literally butchered them, feasting on their corpses afterwards.

His practices are continued in the modern day by his in-bred descendants, who dwell in vast caves on the coast and feed on the flesh of passers-by, as a group of teenagers soon discover whilst exploring the steep cliff-face where Sawney's descendants dwell in search of flesh.
