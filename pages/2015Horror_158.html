Plotkin served as the editor for the [[Paranormal Activity 2|second]], [[Paranormal Activity 3|third]], [[Paranormal Activity 4|fourth]] and [[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones|fifth]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/gregory-plotkin-directing-paranormal-activity-5/|title=Gregory Plotkin Scares up Directing Debut on 'Paranormal 5.'| last=Fleming Jr. | first=Mike| website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref> It is a sequel to ''[[Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones]]'' (2014) and the sixth and final installment in the [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|''Paranormal Activity'' series]]. The film was released on October 23, 2015. The film had grossed over $78 million worldwide on a $10 million budget.

==Plot==
The film opens with a scene from the end of ''[[Paranormal Activity 3]]'', set in 1988, where Katie and Kristi watch as Dennis' spine is crushed by a mysterious force. Grandma Lois takes the girls upstairs while the same entity takes the camera with them. They all go into a dark room where a man speaks to the girls about "Toby" and how they are critically important to his plan.

Twenty-five years later in 2013, Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray), his wife Emily (Brit Shaw), and their six-year-old daughter Leila (Ivy George) are about to celebrate Christmas, when Ryan's brother Mike (Dan Gill) moves in after breaking up with his girlfriend. Along with them, is Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley), who notices that Leila is talking to an imaginary friend named Toby. While setting up the house that day, Mike finds a box of old [[Paranormal Activity 3|video tapes]], dating from 1988 to 1992. In them contains videos of Kristi and Katie with their mother and her boyfriend Dennis in 1988, while others from 1992 are in Lois's house where the two are practicing supernatural abilities with the mysterious man. While watching one of the videos, Ryan and Mike notice that the girls are seemingly aware of the two's presence: they are able to foresee Ryan and Mike's every action as the pair simultaneously watch the video.

Leila's interactions with Toby coincides with Ryan using the old camera around the house, where he notices the camera picks up [[Spirit photography|spiritual beings]]. He later decides to roll the tapes overnight to see what weird things are occurring. One night, a black figure arises out of the ground and hovers over Leila for several hours, and she eventually talks to it. Soon, Skylar walks in and checks on Leila, only to be attacked by the spirit. The next night, Ryan tapes Leila sleeping, but a dark and demonic spirit appears on camera and forces him to drop the camera. The following day, Ryan and Emily go out for the night and leave Skyler and Mike to take care of Leila. After experiencing the entity outside, they discover a slab of concrete in the ground with Katie and Kristi and the year 1987 etched in it. They discover their house is built on the same property that Katie and Kristi used to live in before their house burned down in 1992. It is also revealed that the grown up Katie sold the house to the family and that it was built by the midwives.

Leila gradually becomes less talkative and this worries Ryan and Emily enough to call Father Todd (Michael Krawic). He interviews Leila, and as a result, Leila attacks him. Todd is convinced that 'Toby' is a demon linked to a cult called The Midwives. Ryan researches the cult, and realizes they killed [[Paranormal Activity 4|a family in Nevada]] related to a boy named [[Paranormal Activity 2|Hunter]], who was born on the same day as Leila. One of the tapes Ryan found also shows Leila with Kristi, Katie and Hunter in 1992, a few years before she was born. He also learns that Leila's blood is needed to finish Toby's transformation into a physical being. One night, Leila's interaction with Toby leads her to open a doorway to another realm into which she disappears. Ryan and Emily find her soon after, but flee with Leila to a hotel.

Father Todd comes back and attempts to cleanse the house. He decides to trap the demon, upon which the demon violently shakes the house. Todd is strangled and dragged away by Toby, leaving the family to finish the cleansing. Ryan entraps the demon in a white sheet and finishes reciting a prayer. Leila returns to normal and the demon disappears. After thinking the ordeal is over, Skylar starts to vomit blood all over Mike, but the blood burns him, killing them both. Leila then flees, and Ryan and Emily chase her upstairs, but Ryan is killed when a large arm impales through his chest. Leila sprints away into the "portal" in her room with Emily following her; she arrives at Kristi and Katie's mother's house in 1992, where she finds a young Katie and finally confronts the "human" version of Toby. Emily pleads with the demon to spare Leila, but is killed and her body is tossed at the camera as it flips over. Leila identifies the demon "Toby" and the two walk off as the camera cuts off, ending the film.

=== Alternate ending ===
In this film the same ending begins as Leila turns back to normal. Four months later the family begins to move to another house which contains all the boxes in the truck; Ryan drops a box and finds a VHS tape regarding young Katie and Kristi, but then decides to destroy the evidence to avoid sending the demon back to their residence. To another shock, Emily turns to find Leila with younger Katie and Kristi holding hands as she states: "Look, mommy, my friends are here!" The next scene shows a pregnant Emily lighting a birthday cake, which turns out to be set at Leila's birthday party and that she wishes for a baby brother. The man from the home ritual videos then appears, picks up Leila, and wishes her a happy birthday. Everyone celebrates by eating cake. The screenshots then cuts to black as the film ends.

In July, Paramount announced that it had struck a deal with [[AMC Entertainment]] and [[Cineplex Entertainment]] to make ''[[Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse]]'' and ''Ghost Dimension'' available digitally, 17 days after they drop below 300 theaters, as part of a larger experiment, and asked other theaters to join in. In return, Paramount will share an undisclosed portion of proceeds of the VOD revenues.<ref name="VOD"/> Per industry sources, Paramount is giving participating exhibitors an estimated 2-4% share of their digital revenue made between the time the film drops below 300 theaters and 90 days after its opening date.<ref name="VOD2">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/10/paranormal-activity-6-scouts-guide-to-the-zombie-apocalypse-paramount-vod-distribution-theaters-1201584566/|title=As Exhibs Snub ‘Paranormal Activity 6’ & ‘Scouts’ Guide’, Is Paramount’s Early VOD Experiment Bad Business?|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}</ref> Those agreeing to Paramount's formula includes AMC, Canada's Cineplex, [[National Amusements]] and [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema|Alamo Drafthouse]].

This is about the long-term health of the business, so there is not this long period of time when a consumer can't watch a movie."<ref name="VOD"/>
