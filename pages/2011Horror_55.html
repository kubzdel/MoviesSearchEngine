'''''Evil Calls: The Raven''''', also known as '''''The Legend of Harrow Woods''''' and simply as '''''Evil Calls''''', is a 2011 [[Cinema of United Kingdom|British]] [[horror film]] written, produced and directed by [[Richard Driscoll]], starring [[Rik Mayall]], [[Jason Donovan]], [[Eileen Daly]], [[Norman Wisdom]] and [[Robin Askwith]].

The film began production in 2002 under the original title "Alone in the Dark", but it was not completed and released until six years later.

== Synopsis ==
A group of students go to a haunted forest called Harrow Woods in New England for a weekend vacation to investigate the disappearance of horror novelist George Carney and his family who have been missing (presumed dead) for two years. Led by lecturer, Karl Mathers, the group embark on their investigation into the forest. They discover that in the 17th century the infamous witch, Lenore Selwyn, was burnt at the stake within Harrow Woods. As she struggled against the flames she cursed the land her ashes fell upon. The group are murdered one by one. The George Carney story appears in flashback as the students, particularly Anna, a psychic, investigate Harrow Woods and the abandoned log cabin where the Carney family was suspected to have been murdered two years previously.

== Production ==
=== Titles ===
Originally titled ''Alone in the Dark'', the title was changed to ''Evil Calls'' just before release to avoid confusion with the ''Alone in the Dark'' computer game and its movie adaptation. This is why in some interviews Richard Driscoll mentions it by this name. ''Evil Calls'' is the first in a pair or trilogy of Raven films, inspired by "[[The Raven]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].<ref>[http://www.horror-asylum.com/news/article.asp?item=6257 Raven: Evil Calls Pics & Date! | - | Horror Movie Entertainment]</ref> However, the film was released on DVD in 2011 as ''The Legend of Harrow Woods''.

=== Homage ===
The film derives material from, amongst others, ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' and ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' (teenagers go into the woods to film a project and are chased by someone trying to kill them);<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/content/articles/2008/02/11/aboutcornwall_evilcalls_feature.shtml BBC - Cornwall - Features - The Raven Trilogy]</ref> as well as uncredited footage from ''[[The City of the Dead (film)|The City of the Dead]]'' (1960), which is used to represent the death of Lenore Selwyn (Elizabeth Selwyn in the original).

== Reception ==
The British film critic [[M. J. Simpson]] has published a detailed analysis of the plot and structure of the film.<ref>http://mjsnewsblog.blogspot.com/</ref>
