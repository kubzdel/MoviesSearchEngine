==Plot==
Jacob ([[Doug Bradley]]) is an antiques dealer who sets off with his new young and pregnant wife Lauren (Grace Vallorani) and his stepdaughter, Rachel ([[Rita Ramnani]]) to a forest [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] in a hopeful effort to heal bonds between feuding family members. He also carries a large, mysterious and ancient [[Babylonia]]n mirror, smuggled out of the [[middle east]], which he plans to sell for profit.  Lilith (Natalie Celino), a sultry [[ornithologist]] appeares out of a [[bird hide]] by a noisy pair of friends hiking through the woods.  Gaining their confidence, she and one of the men, Travis (Scott North) go into the woods for a quick [[wikt:tryst|tryst]], but immediately there is a blood curdling scream. The other camper, Stanley (James Fisher), rushes toward the sound and finds his friend mutilated and near dead. Near Travis, Lilith explains to Stanley that the shadows had come to life and attacked them, and the two set off to seek help. When they end up at Jacob's cabin, the entire group comes under attack by supernatural forces of darkness. Rachel discovers [[Irish people|Irish]] cowboy Phelan (Jonnie Hurn) hanging out in their barn.  Phelan is a [[vampire]] and himself a former vampire hunter.  He tells Rachel that the real danger to everyone is [[Lilith]], and explains how Lilith had been [[Adam]]'s willful first wife who, since having been exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]], had been spawning demonic offspring in the world of man. Considered the mother to the [[Succubi]], ruler of shadows, slaughterer of children, and consort to the devil himself, she had been re-awakened by, and drawn to the location of, the occult power inherent in the mirror carried by Jacob. Phelan has been harboring a centuries-long grudge against her for she having "turned" him 120 years earlier, and he had been tracking her for decades, equipped with the one relic that might finally kill her... a bone splinter from the rib of Adam himself.

==Critical reception==
[[Dread Central]] described the film, Drew Cullingham's first directorial effort, as "ambitious", and that the film was an "eclectic mix of family melodrama, vampire action, supernatural horror and Western styling". The review stated that these diverse elements were its downfall, "leaving a wildly inconsistent yet occasionally promising piece of work,"  that it was not lacking in well-conceived individual elements, and the backgrounds of the characters are decently explored.  But the major problem was in the director's inability to deliver on the potential of those elements, with his efforts "cack-handed at best, and laughable at worst."  The reviewer appreciated his "eye for cinema" and his ability to make the film look like it cost more to produce than one might have expected from its small budget. Further, the cast "for the most part" performed admirably; Bradley "seems to be having a lot of fun in a 'normal' role" as opposed to his usual genre fare, and carried his character of a family man with aplomb.  His co-star Rita Ramnani was "effectively annoying and self-centered as Rachel", but was let down by the screenplay, not by any failing on her part. The review considered Jonnie Hurn's Phelan to be "the most interesting character here, both on page and screen," and a well-nuanced and suitably impressive anti-hero.  Natalie Celino as Lilith was faulted for her "constantly off-kilter, disinterested line delivery and a Scottish accent so thick it proves almost impenetrable."<ref name="Dread Central 1">{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/umbrage-first-vampire-uk-dvd | title=review: ''Umbrage: The First Vampire'' (UK DVD) | work=[[Dread Central]] | date=11 October 2011 | accessdate=22 October 2011 | last=Jones | first=Gareth}}</ref><!--for whole paragraph-->

''Quiet Earth'', in writing about iconic vampire characters, compared Jonnie Hurn's Irish cowboy vampire Phelan with ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' and called Drew Cullingham's ''Umbrage'' "a very unique type of horror film, if that's even what you want to call it."  The review stated that despite screening at [[Abertoir|Abertoir Horror]] film festivals, the film was more of a "supernatural/fantasy type of film, featuring plenty of banter and a playing against type performance from the legendary Doug Bradley," and it runs "against a lot of the horror genre's conventions, and also a lot of film conventions in general."  The director had explained to the audience that the film was "never really intended as a vampire film and stressed that neither is the word 'vampire' used anywhere throughout the film's duration", and that his intention was to "take the monster out of the genre and turn this particular type of horror creature into a proper, well developed character", creating a likable anti-hero.  Of Hurn's Phelan, the review stated that he gave "an outstanding, multi-dimensional performance" which "makes the character appear fascinating, entertaining and sexy", in a manner missing from [[Edward Cullen]] in the ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' series, and presents him with "the same kind of [[Clint Eastwood]] style presence on screen".<ref name="Quiet Earth">{{cite web | url=http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2010/04/13/Review-of-British-vampire-fantasy-UMBRAGE | title=Review of British vampire fantasy ''UMBRAGE'' | work=Quiet Earth | date=13 April 2010 | accessdate=22 October 2011 | author=Staff}}</ref><!-- for whole paragraph -->

[[MJ Simpson]] panned the film for not meeting its potential, stating that the film's trailer had him anticipating release of the feature, but the film itself was "disappointing, frustrating and ultimately unsatisfying," despite feeling that it did well in trying "to do something different".
Simpson wrote that it was a "good-looking movie", due to the cinematography of James Friend, the production design by Charlie Falconer, and the gore effects by [[Scott Orr]], but the main problem with the film is its script. Noting that Drew Cullingham was writer, director, producer, and editor, Simpson stated, "When a single individual has that much input into a film, there’s potential for a pure, unsullied, personal vision to shine through - but there’s equal potential for major problems to be glossed over or ignored."  Simpson described the "threat" in the film as "ill-defined", a serious flaw for any horror film. He wrote that none of the film's characters have a clear motivation for their actions. As examples, Simpson gave the lack of any logical reason why a husband and wife expecting their first child together would decide that the middle of winter would be a good time to move to an "isolated 17th century farmhouse 20 miles from the nearest town which has no telephone connection and no mobile signal"; why two adult men would decide to camp together in a wood in the middle of nowhere; why one would become so immediately enamored by a total stranger that he would follow her into the woods for a tryst; or why, after that friend is horribly maimed, the second man would abandon him and hike away with that same woman looking for help. Simpson noted that several more incongruous scenes served a purpose in progressing the plot, but had "no purpose within the reality of the film".  The repeated flaw, he stated, is that "[t]ime after time, characters behave in a way which is illogical, inexplicable or just downright nonsensical - but expedient. ... ''Umbrage'' is a mishmash of ideas that hasn’t been properly worked out."
Summarizing, Simpson stated, "If you want a British vampire western, this is probably the best you can pick. Doug Bradley buckles down to his usual reliable performance, some of the other acting is also good (some less so) and there are some clever moments. But Umbrage could have been so much better and its problems stem not from any unexpected snowfall or malfunctioning generator but from a poor script which was nowhere near ready to shoot."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/umbrage.html | title=DVD review: ''Umbrage: The First Vampire'' | work=[[MJ Simpson]] | accessdate=23 October 2011 | first=Mike|last=Simpson}}</ref><!-- for whole paragraph -->

''Umbrage'' received mixed reviews from critics which praised the acting talent of Jonnie Hurn. At Horrortalk.com, Charlotte Stear wrote, "Basically, this film tried too much to do lots all at once and with its obviously small budget, its main failure is how ambitious it is for what it can realistically do."<ref>{{cite web |first=Charlotte |last=Stear |date= 20 October 2011 | url=http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/1768-umbrage-the-first-vampire.html | title=''Umbrage, The First Vampire'' | work=horrortalk.com | accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref> Horrorphilia gave the film 5 stars out of 10 and referred its "unfortunate wasted potential."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.horrorphilia.com/2011/08/30/umbrage-the-first-vampire-2009-movie-review/ | title=''Umbrage: The First Vampire'' (2009) Movie Review | work=horrorphilia.com | accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref>
