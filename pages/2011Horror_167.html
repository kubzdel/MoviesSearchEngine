Starring [[film actor|actor]] [[Bill Oberst Jr.]]<ref name="Ad Age 10-24-11"/> as 'The Facebook Stalker', the film acts to personalize and underscore the dangers inherent in posting too much personal information about oneself on the [[internet]].<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11"/><ref name="Brand Channel 10-18-11">{{cite news|last=Shayon|first=Sheila|title=Take This Lollipop Spooks Facebook Users|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/Take-This-Lollipop-101811.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2012|newspaper=[[Brandchannel]]|date=October 18, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604064353/http://www.brandchannel.com/home/post/Take-This-Lollipop-101811.aspx|archivedate=June 4, 2012|df=}}</ref><ref name="Social Media Today  10-31-11">{{cite news|last=staff|title=Take This Lollipop Facebook App – Creepy Way to Visualize Your Privacy|url=http://socialmediatoday.com/lewis-bertolucci/378593/take-lollipop-facebook-app-creepy-way-visualize-your-privacy|accessdate=March 3, 2012|newspaper=Social Media Today|date=October 31, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809113555/http://socialmediatoday.com/lewis-bertolucci/378593/take-lollipop-facebook-app-creepy-way-visualize-your-privacy|archivedate=August 9, 2012|df=}}</ref>  The information gathered from a viewer's Facebook profile by the film's [[Application software|app]] is used once, and then deleted.<ref name="Brand Channel 10-18-11"/> The title is derived from the 1963 song  "[[Bobby Jameson#Singles|Please Little Girl Take This Lollipop]]", written and performed by singer-songwriter [[Bobby Jameson]], which is used in the film.

==Synopsis==
The interactive film first requests that viewers temporarily allow the application access to their Facebook account, and then incorporates information gleaned from the viewer's Facebook page to fill in details of the film itself.

Showing 'The Facebook Stalker' as a thin, creepy fellow, hunched over and typing at a computer keyboard, images provided from the accessed Facebook account begin to appear as the stalker types at his keyboard, and appears to search for the specific Facebook user who had granted access. The Stalker becomes more and more agitated as he scrolls through the discovered information, until he locates the home of the user, pulls up [[Google Maps]], and finds directions to the user's home from geographic data contained in his or her profile.  With the user's profile picture taped to its dashboard, the stalker is then seen driving in his car to the user's location, apparently to perform mayhem.

At the end of the film, a screen appears with an image of a red lollipop containing a razor blade. Below the image is the viewer's Facebook screenname and the name of the stalker's next victim as gleaned from the viewer's own profile.

==Production==

===Concept===
[[File:Bill Oberst Jr., October 28, 2011.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bill Oberst Jr.]] (''pictured'') portrays the ominous Facebook stalker in ''Take This Lollipop''.]]
The title comes from a parents' warning to children to avoid taking candy from strangers.<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11"/><ref name="CNN 10-28-11">{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Doug|title=Interactive video turns Facebook fears into 2 minutes of horror|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/27/tech/social-media/take-this-lollipop/index.html|accessdate=March 3, 2012|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>  The concept developed from director Jason Zada's attraction to horror films from his youth, his wish to do something serious within that genre, his experience as a digital editor, and his understanding that people place their personal information on the internet for anyone to find. He decided to create a project that would "get under people's skin without any gore or anything",<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11"/> and that would underscore its point by making it ''about'' the viewer in a quite personal manner.<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11">{{cite news|last=Indiewire staff|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_jason_zada_the_director_behind_that_creepy_take_this_lollipop_web|title=Interview: Jason Zada, The Director Behind That Creepy "Take This Lollipop" Website|accessdate=March 4, 2012|newspaper=[[Indiewire]]|date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>  The writer/director came up with the idea in September 2011, after waking up one morning and thinking about how he loved the Halloween season.<ref name="The New York Times 10-18-11">{{cite news|last=Wortham|first=Jenna|title=Mysterious Site Creates a Horror Movie, Starring You|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/mysterious-site-creates-a-horror-movie-starring-you/|accessdate=March 3, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> Zada explained, "I wanted to do something that messed with people and I wrote the script. Instantly, I knew there was something special about the idea."<ref name="Ad Age 10-24-11"/> He briefly toyed with the idea of using an "[[A-list]]" actor, but instead chose character actor [[Bill Oberst Jr.]] for both his look and his skill. He stated, "When I saw Bill's headshot, I knew he was the guy. It was a twist of a role and Bill was the right type and he'd done horror movies. Some actors would overdo it, the audience needed to see what you're doing without thinking. I wanted people to feel his anger and discomfort with minimal movements. Bill went deep. He trusted the process."<ref name="Ad Age 10-24-11"/>  Oberst himself spoke toward his development of 'The Facebook Stalker' persona, saying "It was easy to get into character.  The filming environment was an abandoned and reputedly haunted hospital, that helped and Jason's script and direction did the rest. Stepping onto the dressed and lit set and sitting at that desk, it was very easy to feel the vibe."<ref name="Ad Age 10-24-11"/>

An earlier viral video by Zada was the ''Elf Yourself'' project for [[OfficeMax]] which had been seen by 194 million people in its first six weeks.<ref name="FWA 9-8-10">{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Rob|title=Jason Zada - Tool|url=http://www.thefwa.com/interview/jason-zada-tool|date=September 8, 2010|publisher=Favorite Website Awards|accessdate=March 4, 2012}}</ref>  Being a fan of "exploring human interaction with media", Zada used similar techniques for ''Take This Lollipop'', but tapped into what he sees as the "larger collective fear we have now"<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11"/> toward personal information being on the internet.<ref name="Indiewire 10-20-11"/>

===Marketing===
The project had no real [[marketing]] at all, beyond its [[YouTube]] trailer and then an initial release on October 17, 2011 to a few personal friends, who then wrote about it on [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Zada|first=Jason|title=Wanna see something scary?

===Music===
Director Jason Zada revealed on his [[Twitter]] page that the music used in the video was "[[Bobby Jameson#Singles|Please Little Girl Take This Lollipop]]", a 1963 single by singer-songwriter [[Bobby Jameson]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Zada|first=Jason|title=@Robbie It's a fantastic track from 1963 by Bobby Jameson|url=https://twitter.com/jasonzada/status/131148175892414464|date=October 31, 2011|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> and according to music production company Little Ears, it was scored by Future Perfect and mistimed for creepy effect.<ref>{{cite web|last=Little Ears|title=Little Ears - Take This Lollipop|url=https://plus.google.com/107860627263428048860/posts/B6XQGpE5wUR|date=November 9, 2011|publisher=Google Plus|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Jameson wrote on his blog: "It took a lot of hard work to get the credit for the use of my song.

Though explaining that the film's application uses a viewer's Facebook data only once, and then deletes it, CNN offered that "the creepy results just might make you think twice about who else gets access to your online information."<ref name="CNN 10-28-11"/>  Director Jason Zada explained that the clip was intended to spur thought about how much information we share online.  He commented, "Our privacy was dead a while back and will never be the same.  Life as a whole has changed. If you look at the video, the scariest part is that your information is in the video. The piece is scary because a person is violating your privacy, not because it's bloody or there's anything jumping out."<ref name="CNN 10-28-11"/>  ''[[Daily Mail]]'' reported about Zada's concerns that people have worries about how their personal information might be exploited, and quoted him as saying "When you see your personal information in an environment where you normally wouldn’t, it creates a strong emotional response.

In discussing how parents must educate their children about the dangers inherent in a releasing of personal information about themselves to the internet, CNN wrote "Behind the litany of frightening facts and figures (not to mention fears like those preyed upon in viral-video ''Take This Lollipop'', an interactive horror film that incorporates text and images from your Facebook profile) lurks a disturbing truth."<ref name="CNN 2  12-1-11"/>
