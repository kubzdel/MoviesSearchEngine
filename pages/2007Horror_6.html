==Plot==
Following the events of [[Alien vs. Predator (film)|the previous film]], a [[Predator (alien)|Predator]] ship leaves Earth carrying [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] facehuggers, and the body of Scar, the Predator that defeated the Alien Queen. A chestburster with traits of both species erupts from Scar's body. It quickly matures into an adult [[Predalien]], makes its way onto a scout ship that is then detached from the Mothership, and starts killing the Predators on board. A Predator's weapon punctures the hull and the scout ship crashes in the forest outside of [[Gunnison, Colorado]], injuring or killing most of the Predators.

The Predalien and several facehuggers escape, implanting embryos into a nearby father and son who are out hunting in the forest, as well as several homeless people that live in the sewers. An injured Predator sends a distress signal before being killed by the Predalien. In the Predator homeworld, a skilled veteran Predator, Wolf, receives the signal and takes it upon himself to travel to Earth to hunt and kill the Aliens. He arrives and destroys the crashed Predator ship and uses a blue acid-like liquid to dissolve and erase evidence of the Aliens' presence.

Meanwhile, ex-convict Dallas Howard has just returned to Gunnison after serving time in prison. He is greeted by Sheriff Eddie Morales and reunites with his younger brother Ricky. Ricky has a romantic interest in his classmate Jesse, but is constantly harassed by her boyfriend Dale and his two friends. Kelly O'Brien has also just returned to Gunnison after serving in the military, and reunites with her husband Tim and daughter Molly. Darcy Benson, the wife of the murdered father, begins her search for her missing husband and son. Meanwhile, local waitress Carrie Adams discovers she is pregnant, but her police officer husband, Ray, is killed by Wolf after witnessing him dissolving the bodies of Darcy's husband and son while he was searching for them in the forest.

Wolf tracks several [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] in the sewer and defeats many of them, and as the battle reaches the surface, several of them disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant, where [[collateral damage]] from his plasma caster weapon causes a citywide [[power outage]]. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool, but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out and an Alien enters the pool, killing Dale's friends. Another Alien invades the O'Brien home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. After the fry cook at the local diner where Carrie works is attacked by the Aliens, Carrie is also attacked after hearing the cook's screams and is impregnated by the Predalien with bellybusters and killed. Darcy discovers her body in horror but Sheriff Morales arrives and brings her with him.

Kelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the [[Colorado Army National Guard]] arrive, but are quickly killed by the Aliens. Wolf briefly captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure the Aliens, but Dallas escapes. Several Aliens arrive and Wolf handily defeats them. Dale is killed by an Alien during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma casters is damaged. He removes his remaining one and modifies it into a hand-held blaster.

As the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly are skeptical, as going to the center of town would cause them to become surrounded by the Aliens, and they along with Ricky, Jesse, Molly and a few others, go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives at the hospital where he dispatches more Aliens and during the battle, Jesse is accidentally killed by one of Wolf's [[Shuriken]] weapons, Ricky is injured by the Predalien, and Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster after the Predator is attacked by an Alien (while being distracted by Ricky's gunfire after Jesse's death) and both tumble down an elevator shaft.

Dallas, Ricky, Kelly and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Aliens before escaping in the helicopter, while Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien on the roof in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|military jet]] arrives. Rather than a rescue airlift, it executes a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] strike that levels the entire city. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani. Yutani tells him that the world is not yet ready for this kind of advanced technology.

==Production==
Inspired by ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', brothers Colin and Greg Strause moved to Los Angeles to break into the film business. After an unsuccessful attempt to find employment at [[Industrial Light & Magic]], the brothers worked on [[The X-Files (film)|''The X-Files'' film]] in 1998 and founded their own special effects company, [[Hydraulx]]. The company produced special effects for films such as ''[[Volcano (1997 film)|Volcano]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Poseidon (2006 film)|Poseidon]]'' and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' and the brothers began a career directing commercials and music videos. Colin believes Hydraulx secured a strong relationship with [[20th Century Fox]], which owns the ''Alien'' and ''Predator'' franchises.<ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back">{{cite web|title=AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back Page 1|author=Mclean, Thomas|publisher=''Vfxworld''|date=December 21, 2007|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3501|accessdate=February 21, 2008}}</ref>

The brothers unsuccessfully pitched an idea for the first ''Alien vs. Predator'' film and Fox almost bought a film titled ''Wolfenstein'' suggested by the brothers, "When the script came up for this movie, they thought we'd be perfect for it because it's an ambitious movie for the budget that they had and they knew that having our visual effects background was going to be a huge thing."<ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back"/> The brothers were hired to direct the sequel to ''Alien vs. Predator'' in late spring 2006 and had limited time to start filming in the fall.<ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back"/> The film's original title was ''Alien vs. Predator: Survival of the Fittest'', but was later dropped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/91651-alien-vs-predator-2-update|title=Alien vs. Predator 2 Update|publisher=SuperheroHype|date=July 31, 2006|accessdate=May 12, 2018}}</ref>

Colin estimates Hydraulx produced 460 of the 500 visual effects shots including the nuclear explosion which was created using [[Maya (software)|Maya]] fluids and BA Volume Shader. The interior of the Predator ship was created using CGI, as the brothers felt it would be more cost effective than building a set.<ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2"/> The visual effects team peaked at 110 people for several months and averaged 70, almost all of the entire Hydraulx staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back Page 3|author=Mclean, Thomas|publisher=''Vfxworld''|date=December 21, 2007|url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3501&page=3|accessdate=February 21, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306040032/http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&id=3501&page=3| archivedate= 6 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Using their knowledge in visual effects and making use of principal photography, the brothers tried to film as much as they could on camera without resorting to CGI, Colin said "other than the exterior spaceship shots, there are no pure CG shots." CGI was used for the Alien tails and inner jaws, whereas they required puppeteers and wire removal on previous films. The main visual effects of the film included set design, a nuclear explosion, the Predator's ship crashing and the Predator cloak, about which Colin stated "We wanted to make sure it didn't look too digital." <ref name="AVP-R: The Strause Brothers Strike Back 2"/>

As a side-note, in the DVD commentary the brothers explained that they want actor [[Adam Baldwin]] to reprise his role as Garber in ''[[Predator 2]]'', but unable to do so, instead using Robert Joy as a new character. Additionally, while the previous installment attracted casual moviegoers as well as fans of the franchises, the film catered exclusively to ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'' fans with many references to the previous films appearing in the film.

===Music===
{{Main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (soundtrack)}}
Composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], was hired to the score for the film. The film's main theme track is a clash of two main themes, one consisting of the Predator type theme (bongos and basses) and the second of the Aliens (high pitched violins, violas and flutes). The directors Colin and Greg Strause wanted to take a new direction from [[Harald Kloser]]'s ''Alien vs. Predator'' score and wanted Tyler to use some reference to the three films' original score pieces, such as the horrific violas and percussion from [[James Horner]]'s ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' and the primitive tribal percussion from [[Alan Silvestri]]'s ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''Predator 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmzene.net/read.php?u=interju_brian_tyler_english_2.html|title=Rambo vs. Predator|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=August 23, 2009|work=Filmzene.net|author=Hubai, Gergely}}</ref> Tyler also referenced composer [[John Frizzell (composer)|John Frizzel]]'s ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' into the score, in the tracks of "National Guard" and "Taking Sides". "Grim Discovery" and "The Chopper", the two tracks from ''Predator'' was listed in the film's end credits, both written and composed by Silvestri.

===Critical response===
Based on 70 reviews, the film scored a 11% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the consensus states: "The increased gore and violence over the first ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' can't excuse ''Requiem''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s disorienting editing, excessively murky lighting, and lack of new ideas." <ref name="Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem - 20th Century Fox">{{cite web|title=Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem ‚Äî 20th Century Fox|publisher=''[[Metacritic]]''|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/avprequiem?q=Alien%20vs.%20Predator|accessdate=February 20, 2008}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 29 out of 100, indicating ‚Äúgenerally unfavorable reviews‚Äù. Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore">{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com|title=CinemaScore|work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

A few critics called the film "a fun [[B movie]]."<ref name="AVp-R fresh">{{cite web|title=''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' fresh reviews|publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes''|url=http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/avp2/?critic=approved&sortby=fresh&name_order=asc|accessdate=February 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206061138/http://au.rottentomatoes.com/m/avp2/?critic=approved&sortby=fresh&name_order=asc|archivedate=December 6, 2008}}</ref> Josh Rosenblatt of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' dismissed the film stating it was "An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy and slobbering carnage designed to bore straight into the pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave the rest of us wondering when the movies got so damn loud."

Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt it was a "B movie that truly earns its B," and gave it a grading of "B" on an A to F scale. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' contributor Joe Leydon said it "Provides enough cheap thrills and modest suspense to shake a few shekels from genre fans before really blasting off as homevid product," and Ryan Stewart of ''Cinematical'' said he "can't recommend it as a good movie on its own merits, stocked as it is with cardboard cutout characters and a barely coherent plot, but it's miles more interesting than the last ''Alien vs. Predator'' film."

There was the occasional positive review; Neil Genzlinger of the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated "It may not be classic sci-fi like the original ''Alien'', which it has in its DNA, but it‚Äôs a perfectly respectable next step in the series." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' called it "Slam-Bang-Horror Action!" and ''MovieWeb.com'' said "A cool new monster...over-the-top violence...''AVP-R'' is a lot of fun!"<ref name="Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem - 20th Century Fox"/>
