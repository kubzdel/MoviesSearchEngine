'''''Creepshow 3''''' is a 2006 American [[horror film]], and a [[sequel]] to [[Stephen King]] and [[George A. Romero]]'s horror anthology classics ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982) and ''[[Creepshow 2]]'' (1987). Like its predecessors, the film is a collection of tales of light-hearted horror: "Alice", "The Radio", "Call Girl", "The Professor's Wife" and "Haunted Dog", although there is no [[EC Comics]] angle this time around.

==Plot==
===Wraparound story===
Unlike the first two ''Creepshow'' installments, in which the wraparound element linking the stories was a [[Horror comics|horror comic]], ''Creepshow III'' takes an approach similar to [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', in which characters from each story interact with each other during the film. There is also a hot dog stand as a common element in the movie. Brochures, ads and other things from the hot dog stand are peppered throughout.

===Alice===
Alice (Stephanie Pettee) is a stuck-up, snotty teenager who comes home to find her father meddling with some kind of universal [[Remote control|remote]]. Whenever he presses one of the buttons on the device, the whole family except for Alice changes [[ethnicity]] (i.e., the "Color and [[Hue]] Settings" button makes her family turn [[African Americans|African-American]], and the "[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]]" button makes her family turn [[Hispanic]]). During this, Alice gradually mutates into what is supposedly her "true form".

Just when Alice thinks everything is back to normal, her father presses another button, revealing Alice's true form. Her family is absolutely horrified at the sight of Alice. The story ends with Professor Dayton, the mad scientist from down the street, using another remote control to turn Alice into a white [[rabbit]].

===The Radio===
Jerry ([[A. J. Bowen]]) is a part-time security guard who buys a [[radio]] from a homeless street [[vendor]] to replace his old one which has stopped working; however, this mysterious new radio is far from ordinary as it can have a [[conversation]] with Jerry. Very soon Jerry is stealing [[money]] and murdering people, all at the whim of his new radio. After escaping with a hooker who lives in his building, Jerry is told by the radio to kill the hooker or she will kill him. He refuses and destroys the radio.  Right after, the hooker finds his gun in the car and shoots Jerry, killing him. Moments after she kills him and wipes the gun clean, she is shot in the head. The shooter is revealed to be the pimp living in the same building as Jerry. When the pimp returns to his car, another radio tells him to go and start a new life.

===Call Girl===
Rachel, a murderous [[call girl]], receives a request from a shy man named Victor, her newest client. Rachel thinks he will be just another easy victim. When Rachel gets there, scenes of a murdered family with their necks ripped out are flashed on-screen, and there is no evidence of Victor living in the house. Rachel then chains him to the bed and proceeds to stab him in the chest, places a pillow over his face, and then has a quick shower. She then keeps hearing Victor's voice saying, "You killed me." Rachel removes the pillow and reveals a gruesome creature with a large, toothy mouth. It is then revealed that Victor is an actual vampire. He kills Rachel and hangs her in the room with the house owners whom he's already killed. Blood starts pouring down her neck in a strange way indicating she will become a vampire. 

===The Professor's Wife===
Two former students come to visit Professor Dayton and meet his fiancee, Kathy. Having been victims of his practical jokes in the past, they suspect that Kathy is actually a [[robot]], which the professor has supposedly spent the last 20 years working on in his [[laboratory]]. She also behaves like a robot and does not eat or drink, which further indicates that she is probably mechanical. When the professor is out of the house, they decide to dismantle Kathy to see what she looks like on the inside. To their utter [[Horror and terror|horror]], they learn that Kathy really was a human being after all and that she was a mail order bride. The professor later buys an 'advanced' [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] kit from the homeless street [[vendor]] to put Kathy back together in time for the [[wedding]].

===Haunted Dog===
A cruel, miserly [[physician|doctor]], Dr. Farwell, is working a 30-day [[court]]-ordered sentence at a [[free clinic]], where he is very insolent and rude towards his patients. He even goes as far as to show no sympathy towards a young girl with a [[brain tumor]] and mocks an elderly woman who is going [[Blindness|blind]]. One day, he buys a [[hot dog]].

Dr. Farwell accidentally drops it on the ground. He sadistically decides to give the dirty hot dog to a [[Homelessness|homeless]] man who has been bothering him for some spare change. The homeless man dies after taking one bite, and he returns to haunt the cruel doctor. The story ends with the doctor having a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] from having had too many encounters with his ghostly stalker.

The homeless man can be heard muttering, "Thanks for the good dog" to Dr. Farwell throughout the segment. Also, it is revealed that the street vendor/homeless man got the two radios from the professor in "The Professor's Wife". After this tale ends, it then shows The Professor at his wedding with his resurrected wife (who is bandaged up from being murdered in "The Professor's Wife") with a huge crowd around them. It shows the professor and his wife drive off, then it zooms in on the back of the hot dog guy's head. He turns around, revealing that he was the Creep all along.

==Release==
The film was released in 2006, in the United States by [[HBO]] through their parent company [[Warner Home Video]]. The film was released in the United Kingdom on October 20, 2008, by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay UK]].
