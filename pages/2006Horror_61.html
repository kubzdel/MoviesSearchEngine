'''''Dek hor''''' ({{lang-th|เด็กหอ}}, also '''''Dorm''''' or ''My School'') is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai]] [[horror film|horror]]-[[drama film]].

==Plot==
In Thailand, young Ton Chatree (Trairat) is sent to a [[boarding school]] by his father to get good grades and does not tell his mother about his father having an affair. Once in the school, Ton feels like an outcast and misses his family and friends. His new schoolmates tell ghost stories about a boy who died in the school swimming pool and a young pregnant woman who committed suicide.  The stories frighten him, thereby exacerbating Ton's difficulties adjusting to the school. However, Ton becomes close friends with another lonely boy, Vichien (Chienthaworn), who Ton later discovers is the boy who drowned, and his death repeats every night. Ton finds a way to help his friend rest in peace.

At the same time, Ms. Pranee (Sukapatana), the school administrator, is deeply troubled by Vichien's death because she believes incorrectly that Vichien committed suicide and that it was partly her fault.  At the end of the movie, Ton tells Pranee the truth, that Vichien's death was an accident and that Pranee should not blame herself.
