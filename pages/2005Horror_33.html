'''''A Conversation with Norman''''', produced and directed  by [[Jonathan M. Parisen]], is a [[horror film]] [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.

It took six years on and off for the filmmaker to get the film made due to problems with sets and [[casting]].  It premiered at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in [[New York City]] on June 13, 2005, just three days before the forty-fifth anniversary of the New York premiere of ''Psycho''.
Parisen announced on premiere night that the film would play that night and never be shown again. Parisen promised that the film would never make it to [[VHS]] or [[DVD]] and would never be shown on television. He said he was doing this to make the premiere night more of an event for the viewing audience. To date Parisen has kept that promise.
