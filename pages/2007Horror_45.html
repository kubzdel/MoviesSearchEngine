'''''Centigrade''''' is a 2007 [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] short film starring [[Colin Cunningham]], [[Daniel Brodsky]], and [[Bernhard Lachkovics]] about a man trapped in a trailer.  It won [[Leo Award]]s and awards at [[Method Fest Independent Film Festival]] and [[Cinequest|Cinequest Film Festival]].  The producers are working to turn the short into a feature film.

==Plot==
A Man ([[Colin Cunningham]]) awakens one morning with a hangover to discover that he has been taken hostage aboard his old, run down trailer which is being towed down the highway by a mysterious black truck; he desperately tries to find a way out of the sealed vehicle before he burns inside.
[[Colin Cunningham]] describes the movie as follows: "''Centigrade'', in a nutshell, is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated, busted-up trailer. There's no wheels on it. It's just laying dead in the weeds. [The owner] does a bad thing, and he wakes up in the morning and [the trailer is] rolling down the highway. It's being towed by a big, black pickup truck.  The doors won't open and the windows won't break and he can't get out. That's essentially what it's about. It's about a man trapped."<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/08/cunningham_heats_up_with_centigr.shtml GateWorld - August 29, 2008]</ref>

==Production==
The part of the main character was originally to go to another actor, but difficulties forced [[Colin Cunningham|Cunningham]] to take the part himself.  The script was written 17 years ago; [[Madison Graie]] suggested to Cunningham that they apply for the [[Directors Guild of Canada]]'s "Kickstart Program" to make ''Fahrenheit'' (''Centigrade'''s original title).  The pair won one of the five Kickstart awards and used the $20,000 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] prize to make the film.<ref name="The Elevator Pitch - May 24, 2008">[http://www.elevationpr.com/news/2008/05/24/centigrade-rocks-the-leo-awards/ The Elevator Pitch - May 24, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918055351/http://www.elevationpr.com/news/2008/05/24/centigrade-rocks-the-leo-awards/ |date=September 18, 2008 }}</ref>
