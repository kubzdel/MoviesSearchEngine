The film received a much more positive response than its predecessor. A second sequel, ''[[ABCs of Death 2.5]]'', was released in late 2016.

==Plot==
Exactly like the first film, the sequel is divided into twenty-six individual chapters, each helmed by a different director assigned a letter of the alphabet. The directors were then given free rein in choosing a word to create a story involving death. The varieties of death range from accidents to murders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/10/abcs-of-death-2-interviews/|title=Permanent Midnight: What’s Crazier Than "ABCs of Death 2"?

==Content==
The movie begins with a creepy stop-motion storybook that opens showing children doing a variety of fun activities that end up being very deadly (i.e. a jump rope slices a girl in half, children playing ball with a boy's head and a girl on a swing made from a boy's intestines.) Throughout the film, a teacher with a skeleton face presents the titles to all the segments with each of the segments ending and beginning with a focus on, or a fade into, the color black.

As they leave, one of the ghouls swats and crushes a louse, and from its remains a giant louse soon emerges. This louse consumes the dead man's hand, creating a living copy of him who then beheads his killers. He takes their heads and shoves them into the insect's abdomen only for his head to get stuck in the hole. He pulls it out, but his neck gets distended.
