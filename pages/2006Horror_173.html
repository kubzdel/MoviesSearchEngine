===13th Floor===

====Overview====
Bearwin Meily and Keanna Reeves lead the cast of the first episode of Shake Rattle, Roll 8: 13th Floor. It tells the story of birthday planners who plan a party at the 13th floor of the house. Dismissing the superstition of [[Friday the 13th]], they went on. Along with them are Joseph Bitangcol, Roxanne Guinoo, Janus Del Prado, singers Robert Seña and Isay Alvarez, and child actors, Jolina "Krystal" Reyes and Aaron Junatas. It was directed by Rahyan Carlos.

====Plot====
On October 14, 1986, a fire triggered by a burning paper destroys an orphanage, killing many of the orphans including their matron Jene. Twenty years later, a high-rise apartment building stands on the site of the orphanage. In one of the apartment's penthouse suites resides Alex ([[Krystal Reyes]]) and her parents, Diana and Oscar ([[Isay Alvarez]] and [[Robert Seña]]).

For Alex's birthday, which happens to fall on the 20th anniversary of the orphanage fire, Diana and Oscar plan to throw a party and hires a group of party organizers. Upon arrival, the group led by Sonny ([[Bearwin Meily]]) consists of head caterer and chef Marge ([[Keanna Reeves]]), the assistants Gino ([[Joseph Bitangcol]]) and Alyson ([[Roxanne Guinoo]]) and the magician/clown Jun ([[Janus Del Prado]]), examines the building and begins to feel the presence of lost souls, which was first felt during their elevator ride.

Upon stepping at Alex's suite, the group again experiences strange phenomena but dismisses them to set up for the party. After inviting some children with their matron, they begin Alex's birthday party. Unknown to any of them, the children and the matron they invited were the souls of the orphans and their matron who died in the aforementioned fire.

The presence of the souls disrupted the party into chaos. The spirits manifested themselves altogether and the original 14th floor where the party was held was changed to 13. After the chase, the lost souls reappeared in the form of the orphans and Jene. Jene reveals the truth to the family and the party organizers: Alex herself has a connection to them as she was born on October 14, 1995, the ninth anniversary of the incident. Jen also reveals that two of the party organizers, Sonny and Jun, are both the only survivors and the reason why the orphanage was burned. Eventually, the souls forgive the organizers and depart for Afterlife.

His fears and suspicions were realized when he witnessed Cecil attempting to eat his infant sister with her long tongue just as he was about to sleep, revealing Cecil as an ''aswang'' (demon vampire).

At school the next day, a determined Benjo sought help from his teacher Mel ([[TJ Trinidad]]), telling him everything about his Cecil's demonic nature and the attempt that happened last night to his sister. Mel reveals to Benjo that garlic is only weapon to repel aswangs.

The train travels into an abandoned station which the passengers thought that this was the final stop.  Exploring the station, they find out that everything was shut down and the gates were closed locked. After several minutes of annoyance, the passengers decided to find a telephone booth to call for help.
