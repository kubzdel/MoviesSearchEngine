'''''Evil Eyes''''' is a 2004 [[direct-to-DVD]] horror film produced by [[The Asylum]], directed by [[Mark Atkins (director)|Mark Atkins]], and starring [[Adam Baldwin]].

==Plot==
The film centres on Jeff Stenn ([[Adam Baldwin]]), a successful writer who is happily married to his wife, Tree ([[Jennifer Gates]]). Jeff, due to a shortage of money, accepts a job to write a [[screenplay]] about a real-life homicide that happened 35 years earlier.  A seemingly psychotic director ([[Udo Kier]]) who believed that creativity had unleashed dark forces, killed his pregnant wife and in-laws for no apparent reason before committing suicide.

As Jeff continues to work on the screenplay, several accidents occur around him that directly mirror events in his script. Jeff begins to think that his writing has the power to affect reality, and must question whether finishing the script will bring about the death of his own family.
