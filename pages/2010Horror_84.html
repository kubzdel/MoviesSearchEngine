==Plot==
Novelist [[Jennifer Hills]] ([[Sarah Butler]]) travels from [[New York City]] to [[Louisiana]] to work on her next book in privacy. When she becomes lost while searching for the cabin she has rented, she becomes lost and stops for gas. The attendant, Johnny ([[Jeff Branson]]), gives her directions and tries to flirt with her, to no avail.  

Around the cabin, Jennifer spends the following days writing, tanning, hiking, smoking [[marijuana]] and drinking [[alcohol]]. When the cabin's plumbing becomes clogged, it is fixed by Matthew ([[Chad Lindberg]]), who has a bad stutter and social interaction disability. She rewards him with an abrupt kiss of gratitude. Matthew then tells Johnny and his friends Andy ([[Rodney Eastman]]) and Stanley ([[Daniel Franzese]]) about his visit. Johnny, whose ego was bruised after gas station incident, decide that Jennifer is snobbish and needs to be "taught a lesson".

That night, the four men sneak into Jennifer's cabin and assault her, although Matthew refuses to participate directly. She escapes into the woods and bumps into Sheriff Storch ([[Andrew Howard]]) and Earl [[Tracey Walter]], who owns the cabin she is renting. Storch takes Jennifer back to the cabin, but when he finds her drugs and alcohol, he assaults her too. When Johnny, Matthew, Andy and Stanley return, all of the men take turns raping her—including, reluctantly, Matthew. Stanley records everything on his video camera. Afterward, just as Storch is about to shoot her, Jennifer falls in the water and escapes. When they cannot find her, Storch tells the others to destroy any evidence of their crimes, including Stanley's videotape.

Jennifer begins to stalk her rapists to learn details of their lives. Stanley tells Andy and Johnny that his camera has been stolen—along with the tape of their assault on Jennifer, which had never been destroyed. Later that night, Johnny hears noises outside his house and finds evidence that suggests Matthew had been hiding in the yard. Storch intercepts a tape sent to his wife, and confronts Stanley, Andy and Johnny to find out who sent it. Johnny and Andy suspect Matthew but they do not know where he is. Afterwards, when they go hunting, Storch kills Earl with his shotgun, saying that he is taking care of "loose ends".

Matthew returns to the cabin, where he finds Jennifer. He attempts to apologize to her, but she tells him it's not enough and strangles him. She next captures Stanley in a [[Animal trapping|bear trap]], smears fish guts in his face, then uses his camera to record crows pecking out his eyes. Jennifer then drowns Andy in a bathtub full of water mixed with lye. Next, she uses pliers to pull out Johnny's teeth and a pair of shears to cut off his penis, leaving him to bleed to death. 

After killing Johnny, Jennifer visits Storch's family, posing as their daughter's new teacher. She takes the daughter to the park and, when Storch tracks her there, Jennifer knocks him unconscious and kidnaps him. When he wakes, Jennifer anally rapes him with his shotgun and reminds him that she was just as innocent as his own daughter. She has attached one end of a string to the trigger and the other end to the wrist of the unconscious Matthew, who is seated in front of Storch. When Matthew wakes up, and his movements trigger the shotgun, which fires a round that tears through Storch's body and blows apart his face before hitting Matthew in the chest, leaving both men dead. When Jennifer, who is sitting outside, hears the gunshot, she smiles.

==Critical reception==
Critical reaction to the film has been generally negative, with a 33% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|i_spit_on_your_grave_2010|I Spit on Your Grave}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film was assigned a rating of 27% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/movie/i-spit-on-your-grave</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a zero-star rating (the same one he'd given the original) and described it as the "despicable remake of the despicable 1978 film". He claimed that it added "a phony sense of moral equivalency", stating "If I rape you, I have committed a crime. If you kill me, you have committed another one. The ideal outcome would be two people unharmed in the first place." While he allowed that the movie was made "professionally," as opposed to the original version that was devoid of any kind of skills or artistry, he considered this largely in the service of the truly offensive material, the rape scenes, later summarizing "this [version] is more offensive, because it lingers lovingly and at greater length on realistic verbal, psychological and physical violence against the woman, and then reduces her 'revenge' to cartoonish horror-flick impossibilities."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101006/REVIEWS/101009983 |title=I Spit on Your Grave :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 2010-10-06|accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=the Your Movie Sucks™ files |url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/your-movie-sucks.html |title=the Your Movie Sucks™ files - Roger Ebert's Journal |publisher=Blogs.suntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624124437/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/your-movie-sucks.html |archivedate=2011-06-24 |df= }}</ref>

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "In addition to all the obvious things that are disgusting about this movie, ''I Spit on Your Grave'' is trying to get us to hate each other. Hate it instead. It makes more sense and the hatred is much more deserved."<ref>{{cite news|author=Mick LaSalle, Chronicle Movie Critic |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/10/07/MV4E1FP5P6.DTL |title=Review: 'I Spit on Your Grave' |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> Critic Andrew O'Hehir also denounced the notion that the film has a message, writing that it "just piles imaginary atrocities on top of real ones, and then halfheartedly claims that it means something. Well, it doesn't."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/10/07/spit_on_grave/story=/ent/movies/andrew_ohehir/2010/10/07/spit_on_grave|title="I Spit on Your Grave": Bogus feminist torture porn lives!|author=Andrew O'Hehir}}</ref>

Some support for the film in mainstream press came from ''[[The New York Times]]'', which wrote, "Female-empowerment fantasy or just plain prurience, 'Grave' is extremely efficient [[grindhouse]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Catsoulis |first=Jeannette |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/movies/08spit.html?ref=movies |title=Movie Review - 'I Spit on Your Grave' - An Exploitation Film, Remade - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> V.A. Musetto, from the ''[[New York Post]]'', also offered some support for the film, stating, "If you can handle it, see it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/grave_expectations_in_redneck_country_zOdjIyUNQfOdOLyttnhpOI |title='I Spit on Your Grave' movie review |publisher=NYPOST.com |date= 2010-10-08|accessdate=2011-02-13 |first=V.A. |last=Musetto}}</ref>

Like the original, the film did find limited cult support. ''[[Fangoria]]'' magazine wrote that ''I Spit on Your Grave'' "...is just as raw and upsetting in its onscreen brutality as the original. Perhaps more so, since the acting is significantly better this time around".<ref>{{cite web|author=<!--Posted on--> Oct 08, 2010 |url=http://fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2271:i-spit-on-your-grave-film-review&catid=50:movies-tv&Itemid=181 |title="I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE" (Film Review) |publisher=Fangoria.com |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref>

==Sequels==
A sequel, ''[[I Spit on Your Grave 2]]'', directed by Steven R. Monroe, was produced and was given a limited theatrical release on September 20, 2013. The film's plot concerns a young aspiring model named Katie (Jemma Dallender) who accepts an offer to have photos taken for her modeling portfolio. Unfortunately for Katie, little does she know the event turns into a nightmare of torture, rape and kidnapping. The story has a rape-revenge plot similar to the first film.

In March 2015 [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] announced ''[[I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine]]'', the third installment of the [[I Spit on Your Grave|franchise]].<ref>[http://bloody-disgusting.com/exclusives/3337017/anchor-bay-acquires-spit-grave-vengeance-mine-exclusive/ Anchor Bay Acquires ‘I Spit On Your Grave: Vengeance is Mine’! ]</ref> [[Sarah Butler]] returned to her role as  Jennifer Hills and R.D.
