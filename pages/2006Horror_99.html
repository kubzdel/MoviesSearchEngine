'''''The Host''''' ({{ko-hhrm|괴물||Gwoemul}}; lit. "Monster") is a 2006 South Korean [[monster film]] directed by [[Bong Joon-ho]] and starring [[Song Kang-ho]], [[Byun Hee-bong]], [[Park Hae-il]], [[Bae Doona]] and [[Go Ah-sung]]. 

The film concerns a monster kidnapping a man's daughter, and his attempts to rescue her. According to the director, his inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Yang|first=Seung-cheol|title=That river creature is his baby: Meet the maker of ''Host''|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2751906|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|accessdate=2013-09-05|date=16 July 2006}}</ref>

It won several awards including Best Film at the [[Asian Film Awards]] and at the [[Blue Dragon Film Awards]].

==Plot==
In 2000, an [[United States Forces Korea|American military]] [[pathologist]] ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) orders his Korean assistant (Brian Lee) to dump 200 bottles of [[formaldehyde]] down a drain leading into the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]]. Over the next several years, there are sightings of a strange amphibious creature in the waterway, and the fish in the river die off. A suicidal man, just before jumping into the river, sees something dark moving in the water.

In 2006, a slow-witted young man named Park Gang-du ([[Song Kang-ho]]) runs a small snack-bar in a park near the River with his father, Hee-bong ([[Byun Hee-bong]]). Other family members are Gang-du's daughter, Hyun-seo ([[Go Ah-sung]]); his sister Nam-joo ([[Bae Doona]]), a national medalist [[archery|archer]]; and his brother, Nam-il ([[Park Hae-il]]), an alcoholic college graduate and former political activist.

While Gang-du is delivering food to some customers, a huge creature (voiced by [[Oh Dal-su]]) emerges from the Han River and begins attacking people. Gang-du sees his daughter in the crowd and tries to grab her and run. As he realizes he has grabbed the wrong girl, he sees the creature snatching Hyun-seo and diving back into the river. After a mass funeral for the victims, government representatives and the American military arrive and quarantine people who had contact with the creature, including Gang-du and his family. It is announced that the creature is not only a direct danger, but also the host of a deadly, unknown virus.

Gang-du is in a hospital when he receives a phone call from Hyun-seo. She is on the phone long enough to explain that she is trapped somewhere in the sewers with the creature, but her phone stops working shortly after.  Gang-du tries to explain this to others, but his claims go ignored by all except his family. The four of them escape the hospital. Hee-bong buys a truck, weapons, and a map of the sewers to look for Hyun-seo. They find a snack bar, have a meal and rest. Upon waking up, they encounter the creature. Soon, they discover their gun only serves to anger it, and Hee-bong is killed buying time for his children to escape. Gang-du is captured by the Army. Nam-il and Nam-joo escape but are separated from each other.

Two homeless boys, Se-jin (Lee Jae-eung) and Se-joo (Lee Dong-ho), are searching for food when they are attacked and swallowed by the creature. It returns to its sleeping area in the sewer, a large hole, and regurgitates them. Only Se-Joo is alive. Hyun-seo helps Se-Joo hide in a spot the creature cannot reach.

Nam-il meets an old friend ([[Yim Pil-sung]]) to trace the location of Hyun-seo's call. He learns that the government has placed a bounty on his family. The friend tries to capture Nam-il, but he manages to escape after obtaining Hyun-seo's general location. He texts the location to Nam-joo and Gang-du. He meets a homeless man ([[Yoon Je-moon]]) who knows about the quarantine but decided to stay in the city. After learning of Nam-il's intentions, the man decides to help him. Gang-du overhears an American scientist (Paul Lazar) discussing the fact that there is no virus; it is all made up to distract people from the creature's origin. The scientists decide to lobotomize Gang-du to silence him. Gang-du escapes by taking one of the nurses ([[Go Soo-hee]]) hostage and continues searching for his daughter.

Back in the sewers, while the creature is sleeping, Hyun-seo makes a rope from old clothes and uses it to get out of the hole. She realizes too late that the creature only feigns sleep to lure her out of her hiding spot. Hyun-seo and Se-joo are swallowed by the creature.

The government announces the plan to release a chemical called Agent Yellow into the river and the surrounding area, hoping it will kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees no one there. As Gang-du climbs down to the hole, the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm hanging out of its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.

As the creature attacks the crowd, Agent Yellow is released, which appears to stun the creature. Gang-du pulls Hyun-seo out of its mouth and sees her still clutching Se-joo; Hyun-seo is revealed to have died protecting him.

Gang-du, enraged at his daughter's death, attacks the creature as it wakes up, but is knocked to the ground. Nam-il and the homeless man come to Gang-du's aid. While Nam-il throws Molotov cocktails at the creature, the homeless man pours gasoline onto it. Nam-il accidentally drops his last bottle. Nam-joo picks up the flaming cloth from the bottle with one of her arrows and fires it at the creature, setting it on fire. Before the creature can escape into the water, Gang-du impales it with a metal pole, finally killing it. As Nam-il and Nam-joo hold Hyun-seo, mourning her death, Gang-du revives Se-joo and takes him to safety.

In the final scene, Gang-du has adopted Se-joo. The two live in his food stand, and he still watches over the river. They have a meal together, ignoring a news broadcast about the aftermath of the incident, on Se-joo's encouraging that they concentrate on eating.

==Production==

===Background===
The film was the third feature-length film directed by Bong Joon-ho. Following the positive reaction to the director's debut, ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]'', coupled with the critical acclaim and box-office success of his previous work, ''[[Memories of Murder]]'', the film was given a generous production budget of around {{SK won|10 billion}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://twitchfilm.com/2006/07/k-film-spotlight-bong-joon-ho-talks-the-host.html| title=Bong Joon-Ho Talks 괴물 (The Host) | work=[[Twitch Film]]| date=26 July 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> (just over {{USD|10 million}}), huge by local industry standards.<ref name="koreanfilm">[http://www.koreanfilm.org/kfilm06.html#thehost "The Host"]. ''Koreanfilm.org''. Retrieved 2007-01-12.</ref>

===Filming===
Some of the filming took place in the real sewers near the Han River, rather than on a set. The stars and crew were inoculated against [[tetanus]] by the medical officer. During filming, the crew had to deal with the effects of changes in weather and ambient temperature. This including the sewage water freezing in cold temperatures, so that it had to be broken up and melted; and during hot and windy periods, the water evaporated and the silt turned to dust, which blew around in the breeze and into the faces of the crew.<ref>{{cite video | title = The Host DVD (additional features) | medium = DVD | publisher = Optimum Home Entertainment | date = 2007}}</ref>

===Special effects===
The director had to work around the budget-imposed restrictions, especially when it came to special effects. The creature was designed by Chin Wei-chen, the modeling was done by [[New Zealand]]-based [[Weta Workshop]] and the [[animatronics]] were by [[John Cox (special effects artist)|John Cox]]'s creature Workshop.<ref name="Tiff interview">{{cite web| url=http://www.cinematical.com/2006/09/13/tiff-interview-the-host-director-bong-joon-ho/ | title=TIFF Interview: The Host Director Bong Joon-ho | author=Scott Weinberg | work=Cinematical | date=13 September 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>
The [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the film was done by [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], which also did some of the visual effects in ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://features.cgsociety.org/story_custom.php?story_id=3678 | title=Oh Strange Horrors! | author=Barbara Robertson | work=CGSociety | date=27 July 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

The monster was designed with some specific parameters in mind. According to the director himself the inspiration came from a local article about a deformed fish with an S-shaped spine caught in the Han River.<ref>Giuseppe Sedia (October 2007). [http://www.koreanfilm.org/bongjh.html "An Interview with Bong Joon-ho"]. ''Koreamfilm.org.'' Retrieved 2009-11-23.</ref>
Therefore, the director's wishes were for it to look like an actual mutated fish-like creature, rather than have a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two fishermen presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still small enough to fit in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film.<ref name="Tiff interview" /> For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only about the size of a truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reverseshot.com/article/host | title=The Host ...With the Most | author=Adam Nayman | work=Reverse Shot | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>

==Political background==
The film was in part inspired by an incident in 2000, in which a Korean mortician working for the U.S. military in [[Seoul]] dumped a large amount of [[formaldehyde]] down the drain. In addition to its environmental concerns, this caused some antagonism toward the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://in.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&storyID=2006-09-07T064102Z_01_NOOTR_RTRJONC_0_India-266323-1.xml | title=South Korean movie monster gobbles up box office | author=Jon Herskovitz | work=[[Reuters]] | date=7 September 2006 | accessdate=2006-11-02}}</ref> The American military stationed in South Korea is portrayed as uncaring about the effects their activities have on the locals. The chemical agent used by the American military to combat the monster in the end, named "Agent Yellow" in a thinly-veiled reference to [[Agent Orange]], was also used to satirical effect.<ref name="Tiff interview" /> The director, Bong Joon-ho, commented on the issue: "It's a stretch to simplify ''The Host'' as an anti-American film, but there is certainly a metaphor and political commentary about the U.S."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bilaterals.org/article.php3?id_article=5825 | title=Korean filmmakers take center stage to bash trade talks | author=Heejin Koo | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | date=7 September 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>

Because of its themes, which can be seen as critical of the United States, the film was lauded by [[North Korea]]n authorities,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/Engnews/20061116/670000000020061116113602E4.html | title=North Korea lauds S. Korean movie ''The Host'' for anti-American stance | work=[[Yonhap|Yonhap News]] | date=16 November 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> a rarity for a South Korean blockbuster film.

The film features a satirical portrayal of the South Korean government as bureaucratic, inept, and essentially uncaring. Korean youth protesters are featured satirically in the film, in a mixed way, partially heroic and partially self-righteous and oblivious. According to Bong Joon-ho, the Park Nam-il character is a deliberate anachronism, a reference to South Korea's troubled political history, which involved violent protest. "When you look in terms of this character, it's sort of like the feeling of time going backwards. [...] You could say that he is the image of the college protester back ten years ago; it doesn't exist in the present day."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hollywoodgothique.bravejournal.com/entry/24485 | title=The Host: Monstrous Political Satire | work=Hollywood Gothique Daily Journal | date=7 March 2007| accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>
