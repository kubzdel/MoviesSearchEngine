The film deals with a grieving mother, Martha (Barbeau), trying to uncover the terrifying secret jeopardizing her family. With her son (Brendon), Martha becomes entwined in a conspiracy involving a fabled witch, Nazi occultists, and the United States of America (U.S.) government.

The film purports to be inspired by an actual military document. The document is viewable on the movie's website by simply clicking on the interactive image of the document. Following [[World War II]], a classified U.S. military document was uncovered that recounted a Nazi experiment of an occult nature smuggled into an underground facility in [[Downingtown, Pennsylvania]]. The film's website purports to "have provided the only known copy of a portion of that document ... we strongly advise that you do not download it;" however, the document can be found on the same website.
