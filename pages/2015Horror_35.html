== Reception ==
Dominic Cuthbert of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated it 4/10 stars and wrote that both the script and acting are terrible, but it could have been salvaged if Perez had not taken himself so seriously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/11071-the-burning-dead|title=The Burning Dead|last=Cuthbert|first=Dominic|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=2015-02-07|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>  Mark L.

Anyone else should probably avoid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horrorsociety.com/2015/03/05/review-the-burning-dead/|title=Review: The Burning Dead|last=DeFillipo|first=Michael|work=Horror Society|date=2015-03-05|accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>
