'''''Deuteronomium - Der Tag des jüngsten Gericht''''' is a 2004 Swiss [[horror film]] written and directed by Roger Grolimund and co-written by Franziska Lehmann. Released [[direct-to-video]], it stars Samuel Binkert as a down on his luck loser who begins punishing "[[sin]]ners" at the behest of an [[angel]] played by Denise Meili.

== Plot ==

Michael Luhser, a lifeless [[Misanthropy|misanthrope]], returns home from his [[dead-end job|dead-end]] office job to find a woman waiting for him. The woman, who claims to be an [[angel]], informs Michael that he has been chosen by [[God]] to enact His will on Earth by smiting those who break the [[Ten Commandments]]. Michael initially refuses to believe the woman, but after she displays supernatural powers he reluctantly goes out in search of a victim, finding one in the form of a purse-snatching drug addict who he stabs and disembowels. With the angel's encouragement, Michael commits more murders, butchering his unscrupulous boss and the man's lover, and then a [[dominatrix]] and her married client. When Michael begins to lose his resolve and become remorseful, the angel coerces him into continuing his rampage by having sex with him, and later by allowing him to drink her divine blood.

Michael subsequently breaks into a [[laboratory]], where he guns down a scientist who has been performing unethical experiments on animals. While fleeing the scene, Michael gets into an altercation with a drunk, who beats him. A bystander rushes to the dazed Michael's aid, but runs away upon noticing that his bag is full of weapons. After filing a report with the police, the woman returns to her apartment, which Michael has broken into. Michael proceeds to chase the woman out of the building and into the surrounding woods, where he slits her throat. After killing the woman, Michael goes on a [[Binge drinking|bender]] and eventually passes out at home, only to be awakened by a policeman barging into his room. As the officer orders him to drop his gun and surrender, a boastful Michael commits suicide by shooting himself in the expectation that he will ascend to [[Heaven]]. Michael is instead condemned to [[Hell]], and the film ends with him going into hysterics as he is taunted by the angel, who was in reality a [[demon]] all along.

== Reception ==

''Deuteronomium'' was judged to be an "above average" film that was technically competent and impressively gory, pros which offset shortcomings like its mediocre story and its not very multifaceted script, by Dennis Pelzer of ''Gory News''.<ref> {{cite magazine|author = Dennis Pelzer|title = Review-Ecke|magazine = Gory News|location = Germany|publisher = Yazid Benfeghoul|date = July 2005|access-date = 16 January 2018|language = German|volume = 1|issue = 21|page = 35}} </ref> Horror News also praised [[Olaf Ittenbach]]'s gore effects, which they concluded were the only worthwhile aspect of the film, its potentially interesting plot having been squandered by inept execution; in summation, the website wrote, "I wanted so much for this movie to be good, at least along the lines of a [[Mario Bava]]/[[Lucio Fulci]] movie, something with some teeth in it that can make it a worthwhile watch for people who want to see good gore. And yeah, I guess, if that's all you're in it for, you can be in for a nice treat. You just have to ignore literally everything else in the movie, and you'll have a good time."<ref> {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/110068/film-review-deuteronomium-2004/|title = Film Review: ''Deuteronomium'' (2004)|last = Horror|first = Rev|publisher = Horror News|date = 30 July 2016|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 18 January 2018}} </ref>
