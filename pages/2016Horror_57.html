==Plot==
Teenage pranksters Brady Mannion, Sam Fuller, Mosley, and Roy, a.k.a. “PrankMonkey69,” successfully convince Mrs. Kolbein that an intruder is in her house and her daughter is in danger. The video of the prank phone call goes viral and the boys become YouTube famous. Sam is upset over trouble with his girlfriend Peyton. With Sam home alone for the weekend, Brady comes over and the two of them make more prank phone calls. One of their pranks involves ordering a pizza for Sam’s neighbor Larry. Mosley, who delivers the pizza from the shop where he works with Peyton, becomes upset with his friends for involving him in the prank. A man who identifies himself only as Mr. Lee begins repeatedly calling the boys, insisting that they do not hang up on him. Sam and Brady are initially dismissive until Mr. Lee reveals that he knows their names, addresses, and intimate details of their lives. Peyton delivers a pizza that Sam and Brady did not order. Peyton reveals that Mosley disappeared after making his earlier delivery. Sam and Peyton have an uncomfortable conversation about their relationship before Peyton leaves. Mr. Lee begins texting Sam and Brady in addition to calling. Video footage he sends them reveals that Mr. Lee is holding Brady’s parents prisoner at the Mannion residence. Mr. Lee prevents the boys from calling 911 by hijacking their cellphone lines. He also takes control of the house’s electrical power. A video feed shows masked Mr. Lee suffocating Roy to death with a plastic bag tied around his head. Sam finds Mosley similarly bound with a plastic bag and tied to the backdoor. Mosley dies soon after Sam cuts him loose. While Sam is occupied, Mr. Lee makes Brady an offer to kill Sam in exchange for releasing Brady’s parents. Mr. Lee sends footage showing that he captured Peyton. Sam deduces that Brady had a private conversation with Mr. Lee, leading to a physical fight between the two of them. Brady is knocked unconscious. Mr. Lee shows Sam live footage of Peyton held prisoner. He promises to let Peyton go if Sam kills Brady. Sam restrains Brady by securing his wrist to the banister with a zip tie to prevent him from leaving. A clue of a child’s image and the name Izzy leads Sam to check a previously ignored social media friend request. The Izzy account reveals that Mr. Lee had been stalking the pranksters for over a year. Sam also finds a sex video revealing that Brady had been sleeping with Peyton. Sam beats Brady. Sam notices from a clock in the background that the video of Brady’s parents is two hours behind the current time. Sam frees Brady. New video shows that Mr. Lee already killed Brady’s parents. Assuming that Peyton is probably dead too, the boys plan to escape and contact authorities. However, once Sam is outside, Brady locks the front door and remains behind. Sam finds a surveillance van outside in the rain. Inside the van, Sam finds Peyton and rescues her. Back in the house, Brady steps over Mosley’s covered body to go out the backdoor. In the backyard, Brady finds Mosley’s body. Brady realizes that Mr. Lee switched places with Mosley and hid in the house. Mr. Lee catches Brady off guard and attacks. Sam has Peyton go for help while he looks for Brady. Sam follows Peyton’s screams to the backyard. A masked man suddenly lunges at Sam and Sam stabs him. The man turns out to be Brady, tied up and gagged to look like Mr. Lee in a mask so that Sam would kill him by mistake. With Sam and Peyton defeated, Mr. Lee explains his identity. When the four boys previously called Mrs. Kolbein, she dropped her phone and did not hear the revelation that she had been pranked. Still convinced there was an intruder in the home, Mrs. Kolbein recovered a gun and accidentally shot her daughter Izzy. Upon realizing what she had done, Mrs. Kolbein killed herself. We find out that Mrs. Kolbein and the young girl were Mr. Lee's wife and daughter, and that he wanted to avenge their deaths. Mr. Lee knocks Sam unconscious. When Sam wakes, he finds Peyton shot in the head. Holding a knife in one hand and a gun in the other, Sam is arrested by cops arriving at the scene. Mr. Lee successfully framed Sam for killing Peyton and Brady as jealous revenge, as well as being responsible for the other murders.

In the epilogue, Mr. Lee begins targeting a new teen prankster.
