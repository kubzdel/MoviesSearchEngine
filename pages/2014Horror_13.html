==Plot==
In 1967 in [[Santa Monica]], John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage porcelain doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.

That night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot the man dead while the woman commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.

In the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter. The next night, Mia is haunted by a malevolent presence in her apartment and believes it to be Annabelle's ghost. During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the building's basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.

Mia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to [[Evocation|summon supernatural beings]]. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], which summoned a [[demon]] who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|the Warrens]] for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.

The priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her own life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As the Forms are reunited, the demon and the doll disappear.

Six months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the [[The Conjuring|first film]].

The film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film ''[[The Conjuring]]'', focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film.

===Critical response===
''Annabelle'' received generally negative reviews from critics, the majority of which felt the film inferior to its [[The Conjuring|predecessor]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-annabelle-movie-reviews-critics-20141002-story.html | title = 'Annabelle': Horror prequel scares up lackluster reviews | author = Oliver Lackluster | publisher = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' | date = October 3, 2014 | accessdate = January 16, 2015}}</ref> The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 29% based on 122 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.4/10.

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the film for its cheap production and screenplay, but was positive towards the performances of the cast and saying, "the film is ultimately so scary and formulaic that you won't forget it."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/annabelle/review/737562 | title = 'Annabelle': Film Review | author = Frank Scheck | publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | date = October 2, 2014 | accessdate = January 16, 2015}}</ref>

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling the film "inspired" but periodically cheap. He added "a cut-rate spinoff from James Wan's superlative haunted-house hit ''The Conjuring'' that (partly) makes up in crude shock effects, but lacks in atmosphere. Designed mainly as a starring vehicle for the eponymous, creepy-as-hell doll (who easily outclasses her human co-stars), this WB/New Line quickie is the thirst of die-hard genre fans and is by the far the best horror movie of the year".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-annabelle-1201319522/|title=Film Review: 'Annabelle'|first=Scott|last=Foundas|work=Variety|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>

Pete Hammond of ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' gave the film a positive review and said that the scary doll show has left him pining for [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] in ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''.
