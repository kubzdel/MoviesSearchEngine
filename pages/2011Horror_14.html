The film features a type of aswang called "Abwak". It  can transform from human to a raven-like creature that could fly and move underground as it stalks its victim. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, praising its cinematography and narrative, particularly  [[Lovi Poe]]'s performance.

==Plot==
Gabriel and Ahnia are on the run from a trio of hitmen who killed their family. The kids attempt to go to their relatives' place to seek help but get lost along the way. They arrive at the wrong town, one that is being constantly attacked by unknown creatures. During one such attack, they are saved by Hasmin, the resident of a local private plantation in the outskirts of town. She takes the kids to her blind elderly friend and foster mother, Guada, who explains to them what the creatures are.

The creatures are called Abuwaks - a type of aswang that look like normal humans but can burrow underground to attack and transform into raven-like birds. It is later explained that the town's corrupt mayor and the Abuwaks have an agreement of sorts wherein the abuwaks pay him money in exchange for keeping the town underdeveloped and misinformed.

The three hired killers, Gido, Queenie and Daniel, arrive at the same town later on to finish their job. Daniel, a reluctant member due to his family being held hostage by their boss Eddie, meets Hasmin, who he tends to run into from time to time.

With the killers finding them, Hasmin decides to slip the kids into the plantation to avoid capture. However, the plantation turns out to be the nest of the Abuwaks, and Hasmin is one of them although she is benevolent towards humans and defiant of her heritage.

The hired killers then track the kids to the plantation and infiltrate the place. Queenie is able to find Gabriel and Ahnia, but she is caught and tortured by the Abuwaks while the kids escape. Hasmin is forced by their leader Moises to eat Queenie alive but she instead breaks her neck in defiance. Gido and Daniel encounter the other Abuwaks, forcing them to retreat. Gido calls Eddie for backup, which will arrive the next day.

Hasmin is able to find Gabriel and Ahnia, but they are caught during their escape. Moises decides that the kids will be eaten the next day - the day when Hasmin will be married to him.

The next day, Hasmin meets with Daniel to seek his help in getting the kids out of the plantation. Shortly afterwards, two Abuwaks enter the town to find Daniel and Gido. Hasmin changes into an Abuwak to cause panic and distraction, allowing Daniel to escape and Gido to kill the two creatures. The townsfolk evacuate in fear of further attacks - an event which aggravates the Abuwaks' existence due to their own dwindling numbers.

Gido, together with his expected backup, enter the plantation and attack. The attack allows Daniel to rescue Gabriel and Ahnia, and at the same time disrupts Hasmin's wedding.

During their escape, however, Daniel is mortally wounded by an Abuwak pursuer and Ahnia is captured. Hasmin arrives and a dying Daniel says that he is not ready to die as he still needs to save his family from Eddie. Hasmin, the only Abuwak with the power to turn humans into Abuwaks, reluctantly turns Daniel into one to allow him to live.

Daniel and Hasmin then attack Moises who is holding Ahnia hostage. They are able to defeat him and escape outside the plantation.

Gido and his team are overwhelmed by the Abuwaks, although they are able to kill most of them. Gido commits suicide by releasing a grenade as he is being eaten.

Daniel, Hasmin, Gabriel and Ahnia are cornered by Eddie outside the plantation. Eddie reveals that he has already ordered some of his men to kill Daniel's family, and that he plans to kill the four of them. Daniel and Hasmin attack and kill Eddie and his henchmen. Gabriel and Ahnia stay with Guada as Daniel and Hasmin travel back to Daniel's hometown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horrorpedia.com/2013/12/23/aswang-2011/|title= ''Aswang'' 2011 Film|publisher= Horrorpedia|access-date=5 April 2016}}</ref>
