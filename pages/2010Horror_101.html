==Plot==
{{more plot|date=July 2016}}
While on their way to Asia to close a business deal, five friends (Anna, Tom, Joe, Alexis, and Chris) rescue a man that's been left to drift at sea. Injured and in shock, the stranger overrides the yacht's autopilot and attempts to change the vessel's course, but instead wrecks the boat on a rock and the vessel sinks. The castaways wash ashore on the beach of an uncharted island and attempt to contact the Coast Guard over the yacht's radio. Before the Coast Guard can arrive, the body of the stranger vanishes from the grave the other survivors had laid him to rest in. Needing some time to himself, Tom wanders into the jungle and is attacked by an unseen assailant. During the attempt to find Tom the next day Alexis is killed by the jungle's inhabitants and Chris is taken. Joe and Anna discover a nefarious plot by the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to cover up a research team's discoveries on the island before Joe is murdered by an assassin sent by the [[Catholic Church]]. Anna is then left by herself to survive on the island and uncover its secrets.

==Production==
''The Lost Tribe'' was preceded by an earlier 2009 filmed version of the story, originally produced as ''[[After Dusk They Come|The Tribe]]'', that was directed by Jorg Ihle, and which starred [[Jewel Staite]], [[Justin Baldoni]], and [[Kellan Lutz]].<ref name="DC-review1">{{cite web |author=Foywonder |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/10922/tribe-the-2009/ |title=Tribe, The (2009) |work=Dread Central |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref> After the completion of filming ''The Tribe'', the producers did not like the initial edited cut, and could not get the original cast back to do further reshoots.  As a result, the production crew concluded that they had produced a movie that did not live up to their original expectations, and that it would not do well.  Thus, they decided to remake the movie under the name ''The Lost Tribe'', but with an entirely new director, script and cast.<ref name="DC-review2" /><ref name="DC-review1" />  
==Release==
Ultimately, ''The Lost Tribe'' was not theatrically released either, and was instead released straight to DVD by "[[Image Entertainment]]" in 2010.<ref name="allmoviereleases">{{cite web|title=The Lost Tribe (2009) - Roel Reiné|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-lost-tribe-v498393/releases|website=AllMovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> The movie was rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] for "some violence/gore".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mpaa-ratings-sept-15-2010-27868 |title=MPAA ratings: Sept. 15, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref>
==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Critical reception for ''The Lost Tribe'' has been mostly negative. [[Dread Central]] awarded the film a score of 2 out of 5, criticizing the film's daytime setting, and decision to show more of the film's monsters which they called a poor choice. The reviewer also criticized the film's finale as being too simplistic.<ref name="DC-review2">{{cite web |author=Foywonder |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/18190/lost-tribe-the-2010/ |title=Lost Tribe, The (2010) |work=Dread Central |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=2015-09-19}}</ref>
