== Plot ==
<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], film plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words long.  This is 697 words long. -->
In a forest, mercenaries Reeves and Karlsson rejoin the rest of their squad – Gantz, Capper, Evans, commanding officer Smith, along with two hooded and bound captives. Reeves reports fleeing from a group of hostiles, as Karlsson sedates Capper, whose leg is badly wounded. Evans reports a farm and jeep nearby, and Smith orders them to investigate. At the farm, Reeves vomits after seeing a mysterious orange powder. Evans, already nervous, becomes increasingly erratic after finding the jeep's engine has been sabotaged in a gruesome manner. As Karlsson sedates Evans and tends to Capper, Reeves and Gantz explore the farm.

Reeves and Gantz find mercenaries, whom they refer to as "group D", and two other captives, all decapitated, in a barn. As they return, they hear music from a storage container. They find a woman inside, who panics when they turn off the music. Karlsson sedates her and Smith orders her brought along. An enemy flare is shot off, and Smith orders a retreat, leaving Capper behind. Gantz and Evan fire at a hooded figure before retreating, but Evan returns as Capper calls out. The rest flee through a field until they encounter an abandoned tank. Seeking refuge, they throw out its cargo while Gantz fires at another hooded figure. One of the prisoners stabs Gantz, and Reeves kills her.

Once inside the tank, they hear noises from outside as attackers attempt to open the door, which  Gantz then jams. Karlsson gives them tranquilizers to help them sleep. Smith orders Gantz to fix the tank. Gantz finds a rotting corpse in the front of the tank, but fails to start the tank's engine. He sees another strange figure outside the viewport. Searching the tank for tools, they find bottles of orange powder labelled "Kratos". Annabella, the surviving prisoner, claims to be a teacher and explains it means "strength and power" in ancient Greek. She secretly pockets a flare gun from a toolcase.

Reeves dreams of the monster Gantz saw and an argument between Smith and the others about the notebook he constantly writes. He awakens and questions Annabella, who claims to not remember why she is there. The next morning, the argument Reeves dreamt occurs, but Smith refuses to show the notebook. Gantz attempts to repair the engine again, but cannot reach it. He reports an orange powder on the engine, before seeing a monstrous, gasmask-wearing enemy outside the tank. After being calmed, he refuses to return, and Karlsson sedates him. Smith orders Reeves to attempt to fix the engine next. Karlsson begins looking through files stored in the tank, and finds they are dossiers on the mercenaries and their captives, identifying them as dead, including Smith. Smith expresses disbelief, saying he did not expect that many casualties, but claims he doesn't know anything. Reeves inspects the corpse in the front of the tank, and finds that the dog tags are for Evans.

As Reeves attempts to fix the engine, Capper appears and taunts them, refusing to open the hatch. He suggests Smith knows what is going on, and asks Karlsson if she knows what she has been injecting everyone with. As Smith and Karlsson argue, Annabella shoots Smith with the flare gun, killing him. Karlsson kills her, before realizing she was accidentally shot by Smith when he was attacked. Before Karlsson dies, she reads through Smith's mission notes, finding that Smith has been recording the dosages of the red-tinted sedative. 

Reeves is able to start the engine. Egged on by Capper, who ingests Kratos, Reeves attempts to run him over with the tank. Capper eventually trips and falls, and challenges Reeves to run him over, which Reeves does. Later, after Reeves has stopped the tank, the rescued woman wakes and discovers everyone but Reeves dead. She finds that the tank's hatch is no longer jammed, and flees. Figures in hazmat suits and gas masks arrive, along with a gas masked man in a suit. Finding a survivor in the tank, he declares "It worked, good." before ordering Reeves killed. The forest from the start is shown again, as a loudspeaker announces that an experiment is about to begin, and a soldier emerges from a white box.

== Production ==
Writer-director Nick Gillespie had collaborated with executive producer [[Ben Wheatley]] on several films previously, including ''[[Kill List]]''.  Smiley had also appeared in that film.  Besides Wheatley, Gillespie cited [[Clive Barker]] as an influence.  Although the film was not meant to be deeply political, Gillespie used imagery reminiscent of the [[Abu Grahib Prison Scandal]] to subvert viewer expectations about the prisoners.  When they are revealed to be young women, Gillespie said it is meant to signify that "something's not quite right there".  Of the film's plot, Gillespie said it was designed to allow viewers to come to their own conclusions, as he found it more interesting to offer clues than direct answers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rue-morgue.com/single-post/2016/11/25/Exclusive-interview-TANK-432-creators-talk-military-horror-and-exec-producer-Ben-Wheatley|title=Exclusive interview: TANK 432 creators talk military horror and exec producer Ben Wheatley|last=Gingold|first=Michael|work=[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]|date=2016-11-25|accessdate=2017-04-07}}</ref>
