Soon she's forced into solitary confinement, and within there she accidentally makes contact with Shadow's disturbed spirit.  Prior to this, Shadow and Solitaire encountered each other, when Solitaire was a little girl, as Shadow desired to sacrifice her in a satanic ritual. As a result of his death however, Shadow never managed to do so.  Now as Shadow realizes that Solitaire is not only alive but also within the prison,  he gathers up an army of the demonic zombie, who were the prisoners killed 20 years ago, to storm the prison, kill everyone else, and bring Solitaire to him.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/shadow-dead-riot]</ref>
