'''''D-War''''' (Korean: 디워, released in North America as '''''Dragon Wars: D-War'''''), is a 2007 South Korean [[Action adventure film|action-adventure]] [[fantasy film]] written and directed by [[Shim Hyung-rae]], and starring [[Jason Behr]], [[Amanda Brooks]], [[Robert Forster]], and [[Elizabeth Peña]].

At the time of its release, it was the highest-budgeted South Korean film of all time.<ref name="kh">[http://my.dreamwiz.com/insight/movie.htm Yang Sung-jin. ''The Korea Herald'' (July 25, 2007): "D-War upgrades computer graphics"]</ref> The film was a box office success, grossing almost $100 million worldwide.<ref name=mojo/> It received generally negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
The story follows the adventures of Ethan Kendrick ([[Jason Behr]]), charged in his childhood by the enigmatic Jack ([[Robert Forster]]) to protect the Yuh Yi Joo, an individual born able to change an [[Imoogi]] chosen by [[heaven]] into a Celestial Dragon, from a corrupt Imoogi identified as "Buraki", who was prevented from obtaining it in the past by Ethan and Jack's previous incarnations. To this end, Jack gives Ethan a [[medallion]] formerly belonging to Ethan's previous incarnation Haram, and reveals that the reincarnated Yuh Yi Joo is Sarah Daniels ([[Amanda Brooks]]), whom Ethan will find in Los Angeles.

15 years after this revelation, Buraki invades the city, bent on capturing Sarah; whereupon Ethan, now a television news anchor, rescues her, conveys the knowledge of her purpose, and attempts to save her from Buraki, during which they eventually regain the memories of their past lives. During the resulting chase, Buraki's "Atrox Army" enters the city and engages the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Air Force]], and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in battle. Here, the Atrox Army is shown to consist of black-armored, humanoid knight warriors; [[theropod]]-like [[cavalry]] called "Shaconnes"; small, winged [[Western dragon]]s called "Bulcos"; and immense, slow-moving reptiles carrying [[rocket]]-launchers on their backs, identified in the dialogue as "Dawdlers". Despite losses, this army overwhelms the human forces, while Ethan and Sarah escape the city, but are subsequently captured by the Bulcos and taken to a menacing fortress in the midst of a darkened desert landscape. There, as Buraki emerges from the fortress to consume Sarah, Ethan's medallion unleashes power that destroys the Atrox Army. Ethan then attempts to prevent Buraki from consuming Sarah, but he is knocked away, whereupon the chosen Good Imoogi emerges from the fortress and attacks Buraki. The two Imoogi, good and evil, engage each other in a duel that Buraki appears to win after seemingly snapping the Good Imoogi's neck. Having won the fight, Buraki again approaches Sarah; but having offered herself to him, she instead gives her power to the injured Good Imoogi who absorbs it. Sarah faints, and the Good Imoogi becomes the Celestial Dragon, continuing the duel until it finally destroys Buraki.

After Buraki is destroyed, Sarah dissolves into a [[spirit]] form, and the Celestial Dragon permits her to speak to Ethan, whom she promises to "love...for all eternity"; then withdraws Sarah into its body and ascends to the heavens. Jack appears behind Ethan, reminding him that the two of them "have been given a great honor" to take part in this transformation, and vanishes, presumably never to be seen again. After whispering "Goodbye old man", Ethan walks away into the desert.

==Production==
Originally titled ''Dragon Wars'' (and still referred to by this title in publicity material), ''D-War'' has a long production history in South Korea. The film was announced in 2002 by director [[Shim Hyung-rae]] as his follow-up project to 1999's ''[[Yonggary (1999 film)|Yonggary]]''. The budget was set at 30 million [[South Korean won|won]] (approximately US$35 million),<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/business/worldbusiness/10dragon.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Barnes, Brooks. ''The New York Times'' (Sept. 10, 2007): "New Tactics Aim to Make Korean Film a Hit in the U.S."]</ref> but ultimately went over budget in order to create the various creatures in the film, with some outside estimation as high as $US75 million dollars. The DVD release confirmed that it did indeed cost US$99 million.<ref name="kh" />

As with ''Yonggary'', Shim opted for a mostly American cast. Veteran actor [[Robert Forster]] landed a pivotal role and [[Jason Behr]] and [[Amanda Brooks]] were cast as the two young leads.

The next three years were spent creating the creature effects, all of which were done in house by Shim's Younggu-Art Movies company.  The completed film premiered at the [[American Film Market]] in early 2007. The film was released in South Korea on 1 August 2007. In the U.S., the film was released on 14 September 2007 by [[Freestyle Releasing]].

On 7 August 2007, South Korea's [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]] (MBC) ''Morning Live TV Show'' broadcast the film's final scene on TV without the permission of the studio, causing a controversy. A few days later the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (South Korea)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]] released a statement in which they said that the incident did not violate South Korean copyright laws.<ref>{{cite news | first= Jung |last=Jinho | title = On MBC's D-War Controversy | publisher = Joynews | date = 14 August 2007 | url =http://joynews.inews24.com/php/news_view.php?g_menu=701100&g_serial=277602 | accessdate=2007-08-14}}</ref>

==Release==
A 110-minute cut was shown at the American Film Market on November 4, 2006 and at the Berlin Film Market on February 8, 2007. The film's final cut was edited down to 92 minutes for its South Korean and American release, after getting feedback from preview screenings. The film was released in South Korea on August 1, 2007. Freestyle Releasing released the film in the United States on September 14, 2007 on 1,500 screens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2007/07/25/d-war-becomes-dragon-wars-for-september-us-release/|title=D-War Becomes Dragon Wars for September US Release|last1=Aiken|first1=Keith|last2=Song-ho|first2=Kim|work=SciFi Japan|date=July 25, 2007|accessdate=August 31, 2017}}</ref>

===Reception===
The film received mostly negative reviews upon release in the U.S. and was not screened in advance for many critics. Up to 22 September 2014, 29% of the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 35 reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/d_war/ |title=Dragon Wars – Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2014-09-22 |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> while the film scored a 33 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/dragonwars?q=Dragon%20War|title=Dragon Wars (2007): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref> Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', reviewing it at the [[Berlin Film Festival]]'s market section, called it "visually entertaining, and superior to helmer Shim Hyung-rae's last monster movie (''Yonggary'' in 1999)", while also saying the film had a "Z-grade, irony-free script," and "likely to end up the most expensive cult movie on DVD."<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932736.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0 Elley, Derek. ''Variety'' (review posted Feb. 9, 2007)]</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Frank Scheck said, "the CGI effects are undeniably impressive" but that "the laughable story line, risible dialogue and cheap humor ... seriously detract from the fun."<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=9847 Scheck, Frank. ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (review posted Sept. 17, 2007)]</ref> Luke Y. Thompson in ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' derided the film as one "for connoisseurs of the 'totally preposterous crap' school of fantasy cinema... You know who you are: You have all the Warlock sequels on Laserdisc [and] the complete Leprechaun series on DVD" and says it's "funnier when it tries to be serious than when it goes for the gag."<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film-reviews/film-reviews-king-of-california-mr-woodcock-shadow-company/17215/ Thompson, Luke Y. ''L.A. Weekly'' (review published Sept. 12, 2007)]</ref>

Within nine days of its South Korean release, ''D-War'' attracted five million viewers, setting a national box office record for an opening week.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The seemingly positive reaction from the Korean population, as indicated by the movie's box office success in Korea, was widely attributed to the film's appeal to Korean nationalism;<ref name="latimes">{{Cite news  | last=Wallace | first=Bruce | title=In South Korea, patriotism rears its dragon-like head | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=15 October 2007 | url=http://www.latimes.com/la-fg-deewar15oct15,0,1373498.story?coll=la-home-center  | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> a logical impression drawn from Shim's message at the end of the Korean version of this film, "''D-War'' and I will succeed in the world market without fail," accompanied by the Korean folk anthem, "[[Arirang]]."  However, despite box office success, ''D-Wars'' was far from critically acclaimed by either Korean critics or Korea's general public. Korean film critic Kim Bong-sok said, "They want it to be successful in the U.S. because it's Korean, not because it's good" and called the film "immature and poorly made" and "below criticism". Other reactions from Korean critics have been 
similar.<ref name="latimes"/><ref>{{cite news | first= Chun |last=Su-jin | title = "D-War" scores with nationalism | publisher = JoongAng Daily | url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2879348}}</ref>

''D-War'' set a record of grossing US$20.3 million in South Korea in its first five days of release. As of 1 September, the film has grossed US$44 million in Korea and another US$10 million in other countries, totaling a worldwide gross of US$54 million as of 16 September. In North America, the film grossed US$5 million on 2,275 screens in its opening weekend. As of 25 November 2007, the film has grossed US$10,977,721 in North America,<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dragonwars.htm Dragon Wars (2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> making it the highest-grossing Korean-made film released theatrically in North America.

Since then, ''D-War'' has been released theatrically in Malaysia and China, both with moderate critical reaction. China was the only one to live up to the South Korean release record, spawning 3,000,000 admissions and a premiere including pop idol Libing Chen. The movie was a box office failure in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Sequel==
In March 2016, it was announced that a sequel entitled ''D-War II: Mysteries of the Dragon'' would be co-financed with China’s H&R Global Pictures. The film's release date is to be determined.<ref>{{cite news | first= Patrick |last=Frater | title = China Finance For Sequel to Korean Disaster Movie ‘D-War’ | publisher = Variety | url=https://variety.com/2016/film/asia/china-finance-for-d-war-sequel-1201734811/}}</ref>
