'''''Hansel & Gretel''''' is a 2013  [[Cinema of the United States|American]] [[horror film]] produced by [[The Asylum]] and directed by [[Anthony C. Ferrante]]. A modern take of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[Hansel and Gretel|fairytale of the same name]], the film stars [[Dee Wallace]], Brent Lydic and Stephanie Greco. The film is a [[mockbuster]] of the [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] film ''[[Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters]]''.

== Plot ==
Teen siblings Hansel and Gretel Grimm are abducted by an elderly recluse named Lilith and witness the horrors of her home in the woods. Lilith and her moronic sons are involved in a conspiracy to fatten up children before she eats them and the local population to serve in meat pies in her local shop "the Gingerbread House". The plot revolves around their attempts to escape the clutches of this old age pensioner, and her mute sons.

== Cast ==
* [[Dee Wallace]] as Lilith
* [[Brent Lydic]] as Hansel Grimm
* [[Stephanie Greco]] as Gretel Grimm
* [[Steve Hanks]] as Brandon Grimm
* [[Sara Fletcher]] as Jane
* [[Clark Perry]] as Kevin
* M. Steven Felty as Sheriff Woody Meckes
* [[Adrian Bustamante]] as Deputy Gerry Carter
* [[Jasper Cole]] as John

== Production ==
Director Anthony C. Ferrante personally asked Dee Wallace to join the production. Wallace was drawn to her character because it was more than just a stereotypical witch. Wallace found the shooting grueling; besides issues with the budget and time limitations, temperatures rose to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and there was no air conditioning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/exclusive-dee-wallace-talks-hansel-and-gretel-and-lords-salem|title=Exclusive: Dee Wallace Talks 'Hansel and Gretel' and 'Lords of Salem'|last=Wax|first=Alyse|work=[[Fearnet]]|date=2013-02-07|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>  Wallace performed her own stunts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailydead.com/exclusive-interview-dee-wallace-talks-hansel-gretel-the-lords-of-salem/|title=Exclusive Interview: Dee Wallace talks Hansel & Gretel, The Lords of Salem|last=James|first=Jonathan|work=DailyDead.com|date=2013-02-16|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>

== Release ==
The film was released [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] on January 8, 2013. In the tradition of The Asylum's catalog, ''Hansel & Gretel'' is a [[mockbuster]] of the [[Paramount Pictures]]/[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]/[[MTV Films|MTV]] film ''[[Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'', which it preceded by five days.<ref name="Dread Central"/>

== Reception ==
Scott Foy of [[Dread Central]] rated it 3/5 stars and called it "a perfectly okay horror movie" after seeing a misleading pull quote of his comments in a previous article used as ad copy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/hansel-gretel-blu-ray-dvd|title=Hansel & Gretel (Blu-ray / DVD)|last=Foy|first=Scott|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2013-01-25|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>  Mark L. Miller of [[AICN]] wrote that the film has "a few worthwhile and creative scenes of grue and gore" but frequently descends into tedious [[torture porn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/60579#7|title=HANSEL & GRETEL (2012)|last=Miller|first=Mark L.|work=[[AICN]]|date=2013-01-28|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>  Dave Pace of ''[[Fangoria]]'' rated it 2/4 stars and called it "a good evening of entertainment" that, outside of one shocking and imaginative hallucinatory scene, lacks ambition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/hansel-gretel-movie-review/|title="HANSEL & GRETEL" (Movie Review)|last=Pace|first=Dave|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2013-01-02|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>  Rod Lott of the ''[[Oklahoma Gazette]]'' wrote that it is "still technically a bad movie, but leagues above the label's usual level of dreck."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-17315-hansel-gretel.html|title=Hansel & Gretel|last=Lott|first=Rod|work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|date=2013-01-07|accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>
