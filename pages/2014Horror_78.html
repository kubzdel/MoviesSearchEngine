'''''Finders Keepers''''' is an American [[horror film]] starring [[Jaime Pressly]] as Alyson Simon and [[Kylie Rogers]] as Claire Simon.

==Plot==
Alyson Simon and her husband Jonathan ([[Patrick Muldoon]]) have recently separated, and Alyson purchases a new home with her daughter Claire. Upon their arrival, accompanied by the real estate agent, Claire sees a figure in an upstairs window. When she looks again, the figure is gone.

They go into the kitchen, and Claire asks "Did something happen here?" She goes upstairs to her new room, looks around, and starts hanging up her clothes when she hears a screw in the floor vent pop out of its hole. In the vent, she finds a doll which she names "Lilly" and becomes infatuated with her immediately.

Shortly thereafter, strange occurrences begin and Claire's behavior changes dramatically. She refuses to go to school, and insults her mother. Alyson finds her singing while pulling the wings off of flies. The neighbor's cats are found dead, and what appear to be children's footprints are found nearby.

Alyson is having a leaky pipe checked when the plumber finds a picture of a young boy and his family inside the same floor vent. The boy is holding the same doll. The plumber informs Alyson that the doll is known as a Mexican Muneca quitapena, and that it is bad luck to find someone else's Muneca.

This leads Alyson to investigate the house's past and discovers that a 9-year-old boy named Zachary brutally murdered his entire family in the house five years ago. Only when the doll's eyes are removed is the spell broken. In the meantime, everyone who comes in contact with the doll is brutally murdered. In the end Zachary is shown as Alyson and Claire moves away and then shortly after Claire begins singing the song of the doll.
