'''''The Prophecy 3: The Ascent''''' is a 2000 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Horror film|horror]]-[[thriller film]], and the third installment in [[The Prophecy (franchise)|''The Prophecy'' series]]. [[Christopher Walken]] and [[Steve Hytner]] reprise their roles as the [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]] and the coroner Joseph, respectively. As the war in [[Heaven]] and on [[Earth]] rages on, [[Puriel|Pyriel]] ([[Scott Cleverdon]]), the Angel of Genocide, arises with the intention of destroying all humankind; the only one who can stop him is Danyael (Dave Buzzotta), a [[Nephilim]] born of an angel and a human woman. However, Danyael is unaware of his purpose until he learns it from Gabriel (who became a human at the end of ''[[The Prophecy II]]''). Gabriel acts as Danyael's guardian while [[Jophiel|Zophael]] ([[Vincent Spano]]) seeks out Danyael. The fate of humankind hangs in the balance as Danyael sets out to confront Pyriel and fulfill his destiny.

==Plot==
Danyael Rosales is a street preacher who thinks [[God]] does not care about anyone because of the death of his parents, Valerie Rosales and the angel Danyael from the previous film. He is then forced to face his destiny. As a [[Nephilim]], he has some of the angels' abilities, such as regeneration, and can only be killed if his heart is removed.  One night, a blind assassin shoots Danyael as he preaches before a crowd, but the assassin is driven off before he can take out Danyael's heart. As punishment for his failure, Zophael kills the assassin and goes after Danyael himself with an extendable weapon with a blade that can be turned into a three-pronged hook. However, Danyael is protected by Gabriel, a now-human fallen angel who killed Danyael's father and performed many misdeeds. After being defeated by Danyael's mother, Gabriel was turned into a human as punishment. Having spent years as a human, he now realizes how wrong he was in the past.

Zophael convinces Danyael's girlfriend Maggie to work with him to stop Danyael, but when she becomes suspicious of his motives, she shoots the angel. It has little effect on Zophael, and he tells her what he is. Frightened and confused, Maggie agrees to help him, and the two catch up to Danyael on a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservation, where he is going to confront Pyriel, another angel who wants to overthrow God. Danyael briefly meets Mary, a Native American woman (first introduced as a child in the [[The Prophecy|first film]]).  Mary informs Danyael that she dreamed of his coming, and that she believes he will be victorious against Pyriel.  After parting from Mary, Danyael is attacked by Zophael, crashing Maggie's truck and badly injuring her. He then faces off against Danyael in battle and seemingly defeats him by impaling his chest with a motorcycle tailpipe, but the angel gets back up and uses his weapon to impale Danyael from behind. Before Zophael can remove Danyael's heart, Maggie empties her gun into him, stunning him.  Danyael takes his chance and removes Zophael's heart through the hole he created earlier, finally killing him.

Danyael heads off to face Pyriel, armed with Zophael's weapon while Gabriel watches over Maggie. He confronts Pyriel, but is no match for him, although he succeeds in impaling him with Zophael's weapon. Danyael is about to lose when God seemingly sends down a [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]], electrocuting the weapon and, through it, Pyriel, weakening him. Danyael extends the blade into its [[Tine (structural)|prong]] form and removes Pyriel's heart with it, killing him and apparently ending the war in Heaven. He returns to Gabriel and Maggie, who is on the verge of death. Maggie is saved when Gabriel's angelic powers return to him and he heals her wounds on his way back to Heaven.
