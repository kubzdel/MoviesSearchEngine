'''''Antichrist''''' is a 2009 English-language Danish [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Lars von Trier]], and starring [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1650-all-those-things-that-are-to-die-antichrist |work = Criterion |title = All Those Things That Are to Die: Antichrist |accessdate = 17 March 2013 |author = Christie, Ian }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.allmovie.com/movie/antichrist-v375451 |work = Allmovie |title = Antichrist (2009) |accessdate = December 8, 2012 |author = Southern, Nathan }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/17/charlotte-gainsbourg-antichrist-lars-von-trier |work = [[The Guardian]] |title = 'I like the idea of never being too stable' |author = Shoard, Catherine |accessdate = December 8, 2012 |date = July 17, 2009 }}</ref> It tells the story of a couple who, after the death of their child, retreat to a cabin in the woods where the man experiences strange visions and the woman manifests increasingly violent sexual behaviour and [[sadomasochism]]. The narrative is divided into a prologue, four chapters and an epilogue. The film was primarily a Danish production and [[International co-production|co-produced]] by companies from six different European countries. It was filmed in Germany and Sweden.

After premiering at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], where Gainsbourg won the festival's award for [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress]], the film immediately caused controversy, with critics generally praising the film's artistic execution but strongly divided regarding its substantive merit. Other awards won by the film include the [[Robert Award]] for best Danish film, [[The Nordic Council Film Prize]] for best [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] film and the [[European Film Awards|European Film Award]] for best cinematography. The film is dedicated to the Soviet filmmaker [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] (1932–86).

''Antichrist'' is the first film in von Trier's unofficially titled "Depression Trilogy". It was followed in 2011 by ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'' and then by ''[[Nymphomaniac (film)|Nymphomaniac]]'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/03/20/nyphomaniac-volumes-i-and-ii-reviewed-lars-von-triers-sexually-graphic-pairing-will-titillate-but-fails-to-satisfy/ |title = ''Nyphomaniac'', ''Volumes I'' and ''II'', reviewed: Lars von Trier’s sexually graphic pairing will titillate, but fails to satisfy |last = Knight |first = Chris |date = 20 March 2014 |publisher = ''[[National Post]]'' |accessdate = 15 August 2014 }}</ref>

==Plot==

===Prologue===
A couple makes passionate love, as their toddler, Nic, climbs up to the bedroom window and falls to his death.

===Chapter One: Grief===
The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with [[Complicated grief disorder|atypical grief]]. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with [[psychotherapy]]. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her.

===Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)===
During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-[[Disembowelment|disemboweling]] fox that tells him "chaos reigns."

===Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)===
In the dark attic the man finds the woman's thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible. She reveals that while writing her thesis, she came to believe that all women are inherently evil. The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear.

Through the autopsy and old photos, he becomes aware that she had been systematically putting Nic's shoes on the wrong feet, resulting in pain and deformity. She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then masturbates the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole at the base of the dead tree. Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.

===Chapter Four: The Three Beggars===
Night falls; now remorseful, she unburies him but cannot remember where the wrench is. She helps him back to the cabin, where she tells him she does "not yet" want to kill him, adding that "when the three beggars arrive someone must die." In a flashback  she watches Nic climbing up to the window, but she does not act, thus displaying her essential evil much like her hypothesis. In the cabin she cuts off her clitoris with scissors. They are visited by the crow, the deer, and the fox. A hailstorm begins; earlier it had been revealed that women accused of witchcraft had been known to have the power to summon hailstorms. Finding the wrench under the floorboards, he is stabbed by her with the scissors, but is able to unbolt the grindstone. Finally free, he shows a vicious face, and strangles her to death. He then burns her on a funeral pyre.

===Epilogue===
He limps from the cabin, eating wild berries, as the three diaphanous beggars look on. Reaching the top of a hill, under a brilliant light he sees hundreds of women in antiquated clothes coming towards him, their faces blurred.

* [[Willem Dafoe]] as "He": Dafoe, who had previously worked with Lars von Trier in ''[[Manderlay]]'' from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what he was working on at the moment. He received the script for ''Antichrist'', although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, so if you have the opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it."<ref name=movieline>Bourgeois, David (2009-05-20).

* [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] as "She": French actress [[Eva Green]] was initially approached for the female lead. According to Trier, Green was positive about appearing in the film, but her agents refused to allow her. The unsuccessful casting attempt took two months of the pre-production process. Eventually Gainsbourg turned up, and by Trier's words she was very eager to get cast: "Charlotte came in and said, 'I'm dying to get the part no matter what.' So I think it was a decision she made very early and she stuck to it. We had no problems whatsoever."<ref>Crocker, Jonathan (2009-07-22).

==Production==

===Development===
''Antichrist'' started with the idea of making a horror film. Trier thought it was a good idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because "the genre [is such] that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had recently seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]'' and ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', from which he drew inspiration.<ref name=filmmaker>{{Cite journal|last=Macaulay |first=Scott |year=2009 |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2009/antichrist.php |title=Civilization and its discontents |work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |volume=18 |issue=Fall |publisher=[[Independent Feature Project]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |issn=1063-8954 |accessdate=2011-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306063602/http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/issues/fall2009/antichrist.php |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref> Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: "At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell."<ref name=hatewomen /> In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether ''Antichrist'' really could be classified as a horror film, because "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [the horror genre] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it."<ref name=filmmaker />

The title was the first thing that was written for the film.<ref name=independent /> ''Antichrist'' was originally scheduled for production in 2005, but its executive producer [[Peter Aalbæk Jensen]] accidentally revealed the film's planned revelation: that earth was created by [[Satan]] and not by [[God]]. Trier was furious and decided to delay the shoot so he could rewrite the script.<ref>Vestergaard, Jesper (2005-04-08). [http://www.cinemazone.dk/news.asp?id=4590&area=3 "Lars von Trier dropper Antichrist"] (in Danish). ''CinemaZone''. Retrieved 2009-06-01.</ref>

In 2007 Trier announced that he was suffering from depression, and that it was possible that he never would be able to make another film. "I assume that ''Antichrist'' will be my next film. But right now I don't know," he told the Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]''.<ref name=politiken1>Møller, Hans Jørgen (2007-05-11). [http://politiken.dk/kultur/article304505.ece "Von Trier: Jeg kan ikke lave flere film"] (in Danish). ''[[Politiken]]''. Retrieved 2009-05-26.</ref> During an early casting attempt, English actors who had come to [[Copenhagen]] had to be sent home, while Trier was crying because his poor condition did not allow him to meet them.<ref name=politiken2>Thorsen, Nils (2009-05-17). [http://politiken.dk/kultur/article712947.ece "Lars von Trier: Det hjemmelavede menneske"] (in Danish). ''[[Politiken]]''. Retrieved 2009-05-26.</ref>

The post-depression version of the script was to some extent written as an exercise for Trier, to see if he had recovered enough to be able to work again. Trier has also made references to [[August Strindberg]] and his ''[[Inferno (Strindberg novel)|Inferno]]'' Crisis in the 1890s, comparing it to his own writing under difficult mental circumstances: "was ''Antichrist'' my Inferno Crisis?"<ref name=independent>Aftab, Kaleel (2009-05-29).

Production was led by Trier's Copenhagen-based company [[Zentropa]]. Co-producers were Sweden's [[Film i Väst]], Italy's Lucky Red and France's Liberator Productions, Slot Machine and Arte France. The [[Danish Film Institute]] contributed with a financial support of [[United States dollar|$]]1.5 million and Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen in Germany with $1.3 million. The total budget was around $11 million.<ref name="variety.com" />

===Pre-production===
Props for the more violent scenes were provided by the company Soda ApS, and made in their workshop in [[Nørrebro]], Copenhagen. [[Plaster cast]]s were made of Willem Dafoe's leg and the female "porno double's" sexual organ. A plastic baby with authentic weight was made for the opening sequence. Pictures found using [[Google Image Search]] had to serve as models for the stillborn deer, and a nylon [[stocking]] was used as [[caul]]. The vulva prop was constructed with its inner parts detachable for easy preparation if several takes would be needed.<ref name=politiken4>Fyhn, Mikkel (2009-05-23).

Retrieved on 2009-05-31.</ref> Czech animal trainer Ota Bares, who had collaborated with parts of the crew in the 2005 film ''[[Adam's Apples]]'', was hired early on and given instructions about what tasks the animals must be able to perform. The fox, for example, was taught to open its mouth on a given command to simulate speaking movements.<ref name=amv>[http://www.avm.dk/artikel/visartikel.php?artikelnummer=5211&fv=2 "Samlejescene med masser af håndarbejde"] (in Danish).

To get into the right mood before filming started, both Dafoe and Gainsbourg were shown [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|The Mirror]]'' from 1975. Dafoe was also shown Trier's own 1998 film ''[[The Idiots]]'', and Gainsbourg ''[[The Night Porter]]'' to study [[Charlotte Rampling]]'s character.<ref name=politiken3>Bo, Michael (2009-05-23).

===Filming===
Filming took 40 days to finish, from 20 August to the end of September 2008. The film was shot in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. Locations were used in [[Rhein-Sieg-Kreis]], part of the [[Cologne (region)|Cologne region]], and [[Wuppertal]]. It was the first film by Trier to be entirely filmed in Germany.<ref>[http://www.filmstiftung.de/News/settermine/antichrist.php "Lars von Trier dreht ''Antichrist'' in NRW&nbsp;– Ein Settermin"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529140937/http://www.filmstiftung.de/News/settermine/antichrist.php |date=May 29, 2009 }} (in German). Filmstiftung Nordrhein-Westfalen. Retrieved 2009-12-06.</ref> The fictional setting of the film however is near Seattle, USA. The film was shot on digital video, primarily using [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red One]] cameras in 4K [[display resolution|resolution]]. The slow motion sequences were shot with a Phantom V4 in 1,000 frames per second. Filming techniques involved [[camera dolly|dollys]], hand-held camerawork and computer-programmed "motion control", of which the team had previous experience from Trier's 2006 film ''[[The Boss of It All]]''. One shot, where the couple is copulating under a tree, was particularly difficult since the camera would switch from being hand-held to motion controlled in the middle of the take.<ref name=amv />

Trier had not recovered completely from his depression when filming started. He repeatedly excused himself to the actors for being in the mental condition he was, and was not able to operate the camera as he usually does, which made him very frustrated.<ref name=politiken2 /><ref name=politiken3 /> "The script was filmed and finished without much enthusiasm, made as it was using about half of my physical and intellectual capacity," the director said in an interview.<ref name=independent />

===Post-production===
[[File:Chaos-reigns-wireframe-trier.png|thumb|Except for the eyes and ears, the face of the fox was generated by computers.]]

Post-production was primarily located in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], and [[Gothenburg]], Sweden. Over the time of two months, the Poles contributed with about 4,000 hours of work and the Swedes 500.<ref name=amv /> The film features 80 shots with [[computer-generated imagery]], provided by the Polish company Platige Image. Most of these shots consist of digitally removed details such as the collar and leash used to lead the deer, but some were more complicated. The scene where the fox utters the words "chaos reigns" was particularly difficult to make. The mouth movements had to be entirely computer-generated in order to synchronise with the sound.<ref>Unlisted author (2009-06-02).

Two versions were available for buyers at the Cannes film market, nicknamed the "Catholic" and "Protestant" versions, where the former had some of the most explicit scenes removed while the latter was uncut. The uncut version was released theatrically to a general audience on 20 May 2009 in [[Denmark]].

The film received a limited theatrical run in Australia followed by a basic DVD release in early 2010. Sale of the DVD was strictly limited in [[South Australia]] due to new laws that place restrictions on films with an R18+ classification.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/industry-alarm-at-r-rated-cover-up/story-e6frg6nf-1225819431495 "Industry alarm at R-rated cover-up"]. ''The Australian''. Retrieved 2011-02-03.</ref> A notable feature of the Australian release was the creation of a critically acclaimed poster that made prominent use of a pair of rusty scissors that had the actor's faces fused into the handles. The poster received much international coverage at the end of 2009 and was used as the local DVD cover.

This film was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of [[The Criterion Collection]] on 9 November 2010.

The film was not submitted to the [[MPAA]] because the filmmakers feared that it would receive an NC-17 rating for its graphic violence and sex.

==Versions of the film==
According to a correspondence between an Amazon.com Customer Reviewer and Karen Mesoznik, staff member at [[The Criterion Collection]], the version released by Criterion Collection on Blu-ray and DVD is in fact the uncut, so-called "Protestant Version" which has a run time of 108 minutes. The cut, so-called "Catholic Version", has a run time of between 100 and 104 minutes (approximately). The long rumored, 120 minute version (supposedly released in France) is nothing more than a packaging misprint on the French DVD release.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9MM9F69DJY3K "Reviews by A.

{{quote|"Von Trier, who has always been a provocateur, is driven to confront and shake his audience more than any other serious filmmaker.

We are at least convinced we're watching a film precisely as he intended it, and not after a watering down by a fearful studio executive. That said, I know what's in it for Von Trier.
