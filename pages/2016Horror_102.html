==Production==
In 2010, producer Kesavan decided to finance a film directed by Sathish, a contestant from the reality show Naalaiya Iyakkunar. Sathish subsequently selected his friend, [[Bobby Simha]], then a small-time actor, to portray a negative role in the film. The shoot for the film was primarily completed in a week-long schedule at Tiruchengode. During the making of the film, Sathish and Bobby often disagreed with Kesavan and after an alcohol-fuelled incident, Kesavan reported Sathish to the police, following which the director left the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Bobby-Simhaa-denies-involvement-in-upcoming-film-director-says-otherwise/articleshow/52290608.cms|title=Bobby Simhaa denies involvement in upcoming film; director says otherwise - Times of India|publisher=}}</ref>

In May 2016, the production team suddenly started promoting the film through posters in newspapers after having completed the film with extra scenes involving actress [[Monica (actress)|Monica]]. After finding the promotional material, Bobby Simha complained to the [[Nadigar Sangam]] claiming that he did not recall starring in such a film and that the producers had used pictures from his previous film, ''[[Urumeen]]'' (2015). He had previously made similar claims against the makers of another film, ''[[Chennai Ungalai Anbudan Varaverkirathu]]'' (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/bobby-simha-complains-to-nadigar-sangam-regarding-meera-jaakirathai-issue.html|title=Bobby Simha complains to Nadigar Sangam regarding Meera Jaakirathai issue|date=15 May 2016|publisher=}}</ref>
