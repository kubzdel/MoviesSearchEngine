'''''American Mary''''' is a 2012 Canadian [[horror film]] starring [[Katharine Isabelle]], [[Antonio Cupo]], and [[Tristan Risk]] and written and directed by [[Soska sisters|Jen and Sylvia Soska]].  Isabelle plays a medical student desperate for money who begins taking clients from the extreme [[body modification]] community in an effort to solve her financial troubles.

==Plot==
Surgical student Mary opens the film suturing extra wings onto a raw turkey.
Destitute and desperate for funds, Mary applies for work at a strip club, where she meets Billy Barker, the club owner. Billy is in need of a medical professional to patch up a man bleeding in his club's basement, the obvious victim of illegal dealings, and offers Mary $5,000 to perform emergency surgery, no questions asked. Mary accepts the money, but spends the next few days terrified the criminal activity she got involved in will follow her home. 

In a way, it does. Mary is approached by Beatress Johnson, a stripper at the club where Mary applied. Beatress has had extreme plastic surgery to make herself resemble [[Betty Boop]]. Beatress offers Mary a large sum of money to perform illegal surgery on a friend of hers, Ruby Realgirl, in a veterinary clinic. Ruby wishes to be transformed into a human doll, and has been unable to find a surgeon willing to complete the last step in her transformation: removing her nipples, all external genitalia, and partially suturing her [[vulva]] shut. Mary performs the surgery because she needs the funds and is convinced Ruby's desire is genuine. Follow up on Ruby's website introduces Mary to the world of extreme body modification.

Mary begins her residency in the surgical specialty, and her teachers and mentors praise her promising skills. Mary is invited to what she believes is a networking party with several of the head surgeons at her hospital. It is not. Mary was the only young resident invited, and the surgeons commit lewd acts on the others in attendance, who are obviously escorts. Mary is drugged, choked, and raped at the party by her former teacher, Dr. Alan Grant, who films the assault. None of her teachers or mentors express guilt or remorse for her attack, and Mary drops out of her residency.

Mary hires Billy and his enforcers from his club to kidnap Grant and deliver him to her apartment for her revenge, which includes involuntary surgery. 

Mary goes into consensual [[body modification]] surgery full-time, with word quickly spreading through dark web channels that "Bloody Mary" is a surgeon of great skill, willing to perform any extreme surgery desired. She establishes herself in Billy's strip club and uses his contacts for her new business. 

A police detective, Detective Dolor, approaches Mary about the disappearance of Dr. Grant and the collection of disturbing tapes found in his apartment. Dr. Walsh, the surgeon who had invited Mary to the party, gave Mary's name to the detective on a long list of women who might bear a grudge against Dr. Grant.

Mary has actually been keeping Dr. Grant alive and using him as "practice" material for her extreme surgeries, using pictures of his modifications as the portfolio she's based her business on. Mary kills a security guard who came across Dr. Grant, and Billy, who has become attached to Mary, kidnaps and beats Dr. Walsh on her behalf. 

Detective Dolor approaches Mary again, hoping to help her since he's learned about the sex parties the two missing doctors used to throw and believing she had been a victim of one. The police circle closer, suspicious about the second disappearance of a surgeon from her residency and Mary's recent wealth.

Mary begins to unravel from the police interest, worry that a tape of her rape will be found, and over the death of her grandmother. The disgruntled spouse of one of Mary's transformed patients attacks her with a knife. Mary is able to suture her own wound shut, but bleeds to death in her operating room, to be discovered by the police.
