'''''The Woman''''' is a 2011 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Lucky McKee]], adapted by McKee and [[Jack Ketchum]] from Ketchum's novel of the same name. This movie is a sequel to the film ''[[Offspring (2009 film)|Offspring]]''. The film stars [[Pollyanna McIntosh]], [[Angela Bettis]], [[Sean Bridgers]], [[Lauren Ashley Carter]], Carlee Baker, and Alexa Marcigliano, and introduces Zach Rand and Shyla Molhusen.

The film was released as part of the [[Bloody Disgusting|Bloody Disgusting Selects]] line.

==Plot==
A feral woman ([[Pollyanna McIntosh]]) circles what appears to be her child. A [[Gray wolf|wolf]], apparently tamed by the feral woman, circles the infant as well, but does it no harm. Although it is not referenced in the film, the woman is the last remaining member of a cannibalistic tribe that has roamed the northeast coast for decades (as seen in the 2009 film ''[[Offspring (2009 film)|Offspring]]'').

Chris Cleek (Sean Bridgers), a country [[lawyer]], sits at a local barbecue with his family. His oldest daughter, Peggy (Lauren Ashley Carter), sits off to the side, upset. His only son, Brian (Zach Rand), watches as a couple of boys abuse and push a small girl into a corner. He makes no effort to save her. While out hunting, Chris happens upon the woman, who is bathing. He returns with a net in an effort to capture her. He knocks her out and returns home with her, restrains her in a cellar, and directs his family to participate in "civilizing" her. 

Over the following days, the family is revealed to be dysfunctional. Brian enjoys causing pain to others, Peggy is withdrawn and afraid of her father, who gives the appearance of a smart, charming man. Chris' first attempt to approach the woman results in her biting off and eating the end of his ring finger. Chris and his wife, Belle ([[Angela Bettis]]), argue, and the youngest daughter, Darlin (Shyla Molhusen), attempts to befriend the imprisoned woman. Chris' will prevails and he orchestrates a violent series of civilizing measures.

Chris bathes the woman with boiling water and later decides to bathe her with a high-pressure power washer. Belle watches in horror, but Peggy rushes to the woman's aid and turns off the washer. Peggy is forced into the house, while Belle and Chris move the woman back into the cellar. Later, Chris rapes the woman while Brian secretly observes. The next day, Brian also violates the woman and is caught by Peggy. Belle, unable to stand it anymore, announces her intention to leave Chris and take their two daughters, but not their "rapist" son. Chris knocks Belle unconscious just before Peggy's teacher, Ms. Raton (Carlee Baker), rings the doorbell. Ms. Raton tells Chris that she believes Peggy is pregnant. He becomes angry, knowing that she will somehow expose the family's secret, and hits her. He and Brian tie her hands and drag her to the barn where he keeps [[German Shepherds]]. Peggy protests, but Chris subjects her to a vicious verbal assault.

In the barn, Chris and Brian lock Ms. Raton in the dog's cage. The cage is shown to also contain an eyeless girl named "Socket" (Alexa Marcigliano) who behaves like the two dogs. Socket and the dogs kill and eat Ms. Raton. Peggy releases the imprisoned woman from the cellar. The woman attacks and kills Belle, gnawing off most of her face. She then kills Brian, severing his torso, and rips Chris's heart out and eats it. A terrified Peggy attempts to escape with her little sister. The woman does not attack the girls. Instead, she takes Darlin and they walk away from the house together, along with Socket acting as a dog, apparently forming a new family. Peggy, resistant at first, follows the new family at a distance as the screen cuts to black.
