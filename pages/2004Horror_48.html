==Plot synopsis==
The story is based on a Khmer tale. A man goes abroad for business. While he is away, his wife falls ill and dies. Her vengeful spirit begins to haunt the people of the village. The husband returns and believes his wife's ghost is actually his living wife until her ghost’s arm grows unnaturally long. He flees the house for help, but, even after a proper Khmer burial, his wife’s ghost follows him to a [[Buddhist]] monk’s house, where he has sought safety. As he recites prayers, his wife’s ghost climbs one of the many nearby banana trees to enter the house through a window. (It is traditionally considered inauspicious by the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] to grow banana trees close to a house, especially near a window.) She kills her husband, and the film ends with the couple’s spirits flying to begin their next life together.

== Origins ==
The film is based on a [[Cambodia]]n legend traceable to at least the 16th century. A folk belief, which many Khmer still follow, stems from this legend, forbidding people from planting banana trees next to their houses as a ghost spirit could enter the house by climbing in on a banana leaf. If there was already a banana tree growing close by, all of the banana tree's leaves touching or near the house would be cut off for safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khmer.org/product/0,prod,0,0,0,2947,0.htm|title=ghost of a banana tree: |accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=Khmer.org}}</ref> This centuries-old tradition is most common in more remote areas today.
