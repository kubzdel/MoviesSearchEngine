'''''Reel Zombies''''' is a  2008 Canadian [[zombie film]] directed by [[David J. Francis (actor)|David J. Francis]] and Mike Masters.<ref>[http://festivals.carolinatheatre.org/nevermore/films.php Nevermore Film Festival - February 20-22, 2009]</ref>  It is the third film in a loose trilogy that includes ''[[Zombie Night (2003 film)|Zombie Night]]'' and ''[[Zombie Night 2: Awakening]]''.  Shot in documentary style, it depicts a film crew that attempts to follow up on their low budget zombie films during an outbreak of a real zombie apocalypse.

== Synopsis ==
When a zombie outbreak erupts, zombie films are made illegal.  Undeterred, a low budget film crew set out to create the sequel to their two previous, unsuccessful zombie films, reasoning that once zombie plague ends, there will once again be a market.  The filmmakers attempt to film around the hostile zombies, while also using them as extras in their film.
