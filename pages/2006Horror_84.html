As stated by Takashi Shimizu, the film is not a [[remake]] of any Japanese film and follows a different storyline.<ref>{{cite web | author= Sci Fi | date=September 10, 2006| title= Grudge 2 not a remake | work= Sci Fi| url= http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=35283| accessdate=2006-09-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060627054207/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=35283 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-27}}</ref> Like its predecessor, the film features a plot that is told through a [[nonlinear narrative|non-linear]] sequence of events and includes several intersecting [[subplot]]s. The three main subplots include: Karen's younger sister Aubrey coming to Japan after finding out about Doug's death, a schoolgirl named Allison being hunted by the ghosts after entering the house with two of her classmates and a young boy named Jake whose apartment building is haunted by the ghosts of the Saeki family. 

The film was announced after the release of the previous film in October 2004, due to its financial success. Shimizu was announced to return as director on January 2005 and casting begun on December, with the announcement of Gellar returning.

==Plot==
In Japanese society, it is said a [[curse]] is created when a person dies in the grip of a powerful [[rage (emotion)|rage]] or sorrow. Those who encounter the evil supernatural force are consumed by it, the curse is born repeatedly and spreads. The original victims of the curse, the Saeki family, haunt their Tokyo suburban house as ghosts and kill anyone who enters. Housewife [[Kayako Saeki]] was murdered by her husband [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]] after he discovered she loved another man, their son [[Toshio Saeki|Toshio]] and pet cat Mar also being murdered, before Takeo was hanged by Kayako’s ghost. In the first film, American [[social worker]] Karen Davis tried to burn the house down to stop the curse, but failed, finding herself hospitalised and haunted by Kayako. The film's chronology is told in a non-linear fashion, taking place in 2004 and 2006 respectively.

Karen's younger sister Aubrey is summoned by their bed-ridden mother who informs Aubrey of Karen's situation and sends her to [[Tokyo]] to retrieve her. In Japan, Aubrey struggles to communicate with the hospital staff but a [[journalist]] named Eason aids her. Aubrey briefly speaks with Karen, who quickly panics, and has to be restrained. Karen later escapes her restraints and flees through the hospital stalked by Kayako, until she makes it to the roof which Kayako throws her off in front of Aubrey and Eason. Eason explains the curse to Aubrey, revealing he rescued Karen from the house fire, and has been investigating the Saeki murders and surrounding events. The two go to the house to retrieve Kayako’s diary, but Toshio drags Aubrey inside to curse her.

Eason takes the diary to an associate, who explains Kayako’s mother Mrs. Kawamata was an [[itako]] who [[exorcism|exorcised]] evil spirits from visitors and fed them to her daughter. Aubrey and Eason plan to visit Mrs. Kawamata the next day, but Eason develops photographs he took of the Saeki house and Kayako emerges from a photo to murder him. Aubrey discovers his body in the morning and travels alone to Mrs. Kawamata's remote rural home. Kayako's mother warns her the curse is irreversible, and is suddenly killed by her daughter. Aubrey ventures to the house, following an image of Karen inside but encounters Takeo's ghost who plays out the night he discovered his wife's disloyalty, and snaps Aubrey's neck.

Two years later, school girls Allison Fleming, Vanessa, and Miyuki, break into the house on a dare but Allison is locked in the closet and encounters Aubrey's ghost but the girls escape. After Miyuki and Vanessa are consumed by the curse, Allison speaks with school counsellor Ms. Dale about the curse, but Dale denies its existence, revealing she went to the house and is actually a ghost herself. Allison is haunted by the ghosts of her friends, and she eventually flees back to [[Chicago]], where she stays with her parents.

The Kimbles move into an apartment block in Chicago. A young boy named Jake is disturbed by a strange presence in the building brought about by a hooded stranger who covers windows with newspaper. Jake's father Bill and stepmother Trish are influenced by the curse, Bill accusing his wife of having an affair but she bludgeons him with a [[frying pan]]. Jake and his sister Lacey return from school, but Jake finds his family are all dead. He runs into the hooded person, revealed to be Allison, who explains the curse followed her. Kayako appears in Allison's hood, finally taking her, and then emerges to attack Jake.

The film was later placed into [[Development hell|production hell]] for almost a year until December 2005, when the first few cast ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] and [[Teresa Palmer]]) members were announced.

[[Film director|Director]] [[Takashi Shimizu]] said in an [[interview]] with [[Syfy#Blastr|Sci Fi Wire]]: "For ''The Grudge 2'', I was going for this mystery that was never there in ''[[The Grudge]]'', and I think that's going to fulfill the audience. ... There's a secret about Kayako's childhood life, so that's part of the big mystery. And the other mystery is this grudge will never stop, and it's going to ... spread. And how is it going to get spread? That's another mystery."<ref name="Sci Fi September 10, 2006">{{cite web | author= Sci Fi | date=September 10, 2006| title= Director discusses Grudge 2 | work= Sci Fi| url= http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=35283| accessdate=2006-09-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060627054207/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&id=35283 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-06-27}}</ref>

He also clarified that:
"''The Grudge'' was a complete [[remake]] of ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge|Ju-on]]'', meaning the storyline was very similar. Basically, it's the same. But ''Grudge 2'' is actually different from ''[[Ju-on: The Grudge 2]]'', and I don't think I would have accepted this job if it was going to be the same storyline. And because it was a different story, you know, my motivation was a bit higher, and I actually enjoy doing this."<ref name="Sci Fi September 10, 2006"/>

===Marketing===
[[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] employed various methods to promote ''The Grudge 2''. On April 1, 2006, a teaser [[Website|site]] was launched with details revealing the October 13 release date. Many [[Internet forum|forum]] sites such as [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] were swamped with claims that [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] was playing an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's joke]]. A few days later, the site's authenticity was proven, and claims that it was a [[hoax]] were dismissed.

On September 10, 2006, Sony released a [[missing person]]s file on its official [[blog]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Official Blog |date=September 10, 2006 |title=Missing Person File for Jason C |work=Sony |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |accessdate=2006-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318141237/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/blog/ |archivedate=2009-03-18 |df= }}</ref> stating a student filmmaker known as "Jason C" (Jason Cutler) disappeared a few weeks after visiting the set of the film. The blog originally broadcast interviews with the film's stars including [[Amber Tamblyn]], [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] and [[Jenna Dewan]] but has been taken over by his [[roommate]] who filed the report.<ref>{{cite web|author=Coming Soon |date=September 10, 2006 |title=Details regarding Jason C |work=Coming Soon |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/grudgenews.php?id=16391 |accessdate=2006-09-10 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On September 19, 2006, [[Yahoo!]] Movies was the first site to release three [[Short subject|short films]] titled ''Tales from the Grudge'' with an introduction from one of the producers of ''The Grudge'', [[Sam Raimi]]. The series of short expands on the story of the Saeki curse.<ref>{{cite web | author= Yahoo Movies | date=September 20, 2006| title= Yahoo Movies screening 3 short films| work= Yahoo Movies| url= https://movies.yahoo.com/feature/thegrudge2.html | accessdate=2006-09-10}}</ref> The shorts also appear on the film's official site [http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/site/ Sony Pictures Entertainment]; fans who volunteered their mobile phone number received surprise calls from Kayako or Toshio. The films also became available on other film and horror-related websites as part of a wide-reaching and unique [[Internet marketing|digital marketing strategy]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Counting Down | date= October 5, 2006 | title= Films designed as a marketing strategy | work= Counting Down | url= http://www.countingdown.com/movies/3578583/news?item_id=3906279 | accessdate= 2006-10-05 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203734/http://www.countingdown.com/movies/3578583/news?item_id=3906279 | archivedate= September 27, 2007 | df=  }}</ref>

The shorts were directed by [[Toby Wilkins]] (director of ''[[The Grudge 3]]''), and written by [[Ben Ketai]].

* '''Part 1, "Hotel":''' The first in the series of shorts. It introduces Ross (played by Daniel Sykes) as he wakes up in a Tokyo hotel room and coughs up quantities of Kayako's black hair. He wakes from this [[nightmare]] to the sound of the [[mobile phone]] and answers it. The caller is his girlfriend Abby (played by Stefanie Butler), who is safe at home in the US. Ross explains that his attempts to investigate ''the house'' and ''the woman with long black hair'' have led to a dead end. When the phone call ends, we stay with Ross as he takes a photo of himself with his mobile phone. He does not notice as Kayako passes by behind him at the precise moment he takes the shot. He then sends the picture to Abby. Ross then goes to brush his teeth and finds black hair in his toothbrush before being grabbed through the mirror by Kayako.
* '''Part 2, "School":''' The second short film in which we follow the story of Abby as she ends the phone call from the first short. Abby then proceeds to call her friend, Brooke (played by Ginny Weirick), to ask about plans that evening. When the call ends, Abby receives a [[Multimedia Messaging Service|photo message]] from her boyfriend Ross (from the first short). When Abby looks closer at the image, she sees that Kayako is in the hotel room with Ross. Abby attempts to call her boyfriend and warn him, but she only hears Kayako and then it hangs up. Abby looks over at the girl that was sitting beside her to see Kayako.
* '''Part 3, "House":''' The third short film that overlaps during the events in "School". The film opens with Brooke (as introduced in the second short) receiving a phone call from Abby. As the call ends, Brooke agrees to play [[hide and seek]] with the child, Josh, whom she is [[babysitting]] and chooses a walk-in closet as her hiding place. Brooke soon finds herself trapped and is dragged violently into the [[underworld]] by Kayako. Josh then gets up and says "Come out, come out, wherever you are," before Brooke's cell phone begins ringing.

It placed number 1 at the box office, beating out ''[[The Departed]]''. The film showed poor staying power and earned $39.1 million in North America, making it the first ever film to open over $20 million yet gross less than 50% of its earnings after opening weekend. It also easily set the record for lowest gross of a $20 million opener. It earned an additional $30 million internationally.<ref name="mojo" /> The movie made $70 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film was one of three films not shown to [[Film criticism|film critics]] on the release date (others included ''[[The Marine]]'' and ''[[One Night with the King]]'').<ref>{{cite web | author= Rotten Tomatoes| date=October 13, 2006| title= Grudge 2 not screened for critics | work= Rotten Tomatoes| url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/comments/?entryid=369285

The film was criticized by several critics for its confusing plot. Keith Phipps from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote, "While The Grudge 2 deserves some credit for creating and sustaining a [[Setting tone|creepy atmosphere]], it doesn't matter much when the plot doesn't go anywhere."<ref>{{cite web | author= A.V.

The film has also been criticised as being [[Attractiveness|eye candy]]. Terry Lawson from the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' judged, "''The Grudge 2'' is just a [[mélange]] of images, some mildly disturbing, but mostly just variations on a theme."<ref>{{cite web |author=Detroit Free Press |date=October 13, 2006 |title=Detroit Free Press review |work=Detroit Free press review |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061013/NEWS99/61013029 |accessdate=2006-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110842/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20061013%2FNEWS99%2F61013029 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df= }}</ref>
