== Production ==
The project began to take shape in 2011, when producer Amanda L. Manuel approached director Michael Todd Schneider to direct her first short film. Amanda L. Manuel and Michael Todd Schneider filmed a segment titled, "Manna" together. The project began to snowball after Amanda signed on Uwe Boll and Michael Todd Schneider's associate [[Masters of Horror]] writer [[Scott Swan]] about developing several segments for the film based on Amanda L. Manuel's story concepts, as well as a wrap-around script she wrote with published novelist Ray Garton.   

In March 2012, it was announced that [[Uwe Boll]] had finished directing a short horror story for the anthology.<ref>[http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/166063-uwe-boll-contributes-to-the-profane-exhibit-first-pics Uwe Boll Contributes to The Profane Exhibit, First Pics]</ref>

Producer Amanda L. Manuel shot the majority of the footage for The Profane Exhibit between 2012-2016, giving a sneak preview of the film at the Housecore Horror Film Festival in October. Housecore, which is run by Philip H Anselmo and Corey Mitchell, was the first event at which several segments were shown although the project continued to successfully grow it was still a work in progress.

Amanda L. Manuel cancelled production on ''The Book'', an Italian collaborative project which brings together a number of Giallo and Italian Horror directors.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/new/ruggero-deodato-umberto-lenzi-lamberto-bava-italian-genre-anthology-the-book/ Italian Genre Maestros unite for anthology “THE BOOK”]</ref> 

''The Profane Exhibit'' was finally released and distributed in 2013.

== Reception ==
While the film's international premiere is set for the [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]] in 2014, a great deal of magazine and radio coverage has been generate in the run up to the release.

[[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre Magazine]] ran extensive coverage of the feature, calling it "The Biggest Cult Film Ever".<ref>[http://horrorunlimited.blogspot.com/2012/09/profane-exhibit-extreme-international.html Horrorunlimited]</ref>

Diabolique Magazine published a nine-page article in Issue No. 19 (Jan/Feb 2014) entitled The Gatekeepers.<ref>[http://diaboliquemagazine.com/product/diabolique-magazine-19-janfeb-2014/ Diabolique Magazine No. 19 (Jan/Feb 2014)]</ref> The feature, written by Colin McCracken, contained an exclusive interview with Amanda L. Manuel, in which the project was explained in full to Greg Petaloudis. 

The article stated, ''"With no jokey cameos, self-referential post modernism or internalised jibing taking place, it appears that a sense of thoughtful insight and craftsmanship has made a return to the genre."''{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The leading genre website Zombiehamster.com ran an exclusive "first look" review of the film on January 27, 2014,<ref>[http://zombiehamster.com/reviews/indie/profane-exhibit-2014/ The Profane Exhibit (2014) Zombie Hamster]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417123818/http://zombiehamster.com/reviews/indie/profane-exhibit-2014/ |date=April 17, 2014 }}</ref> in which it was described as ''"De Sade for the digital age"''. The film was given a score of 85% and the overall reception was positive and enthusiastic.

Preston Carnell of Film Bizarro, after attending a screening of five the film's segments, gave a negative critique of the anthology, writing, "What was shown was far from impressive. What was shown was bland and dull, to be honest. Only [[Uwe Boll]]'s and [[Nacho Vigalondo]]'s contributions were interesting but even they were simplistic and lacked any sort of impact. They weren't a punch to the gut like they could have been."<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.filmbizarro.com/profanepreview.php|title = A Profane Preview|last = Carnell|first = Preston|publisher = Film Bizarro|date = November 4, 2013|website = filmbizarro.com|accessdate = November 7, 2013}}</ref>
