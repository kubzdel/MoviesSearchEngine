It is soon realised that the only way for them to escape is to solve the mystery behind this horrific secret.<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton |first=Steve |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/34416/diagnosis-death-dvd-trailer-hits |title=Diagnosis Death DVD Trailer Hits |publisher=Dread Central |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2015-12-01}}</ref> Eventually, they find out that the nurse in charge of the facility, Nurse Bates, murdered her sister and nephew in the facility and covered it up as a murder/suicide. In an attempt to keep them quiet, Nurse Bates tries to kill Andre and Juliet, but ghosts of her victims return and take vengeance, killing Bates by impaling her with a stool. Andre and Juliet are later cured of their ailments, despite the fact that they were given [[placebo]]s in the trial. They then go off to take advantage of the second chance they have been given in life.
