A group of archeologists go into a ghost village that is cursed by its past. They ignore the warnings of the natives, but soon after they arrive, terror strikes. Weird bugs come out of flames to bite Cemil, Ayadan is raped by an invisible force (she awakes from it like a dream), babies are heard crying in the air, and more unnerving incidents occur. After the unexpected murder by decapitation of Cemil, the group finally bands together to try to take on the evil forces lurking around every corner.
