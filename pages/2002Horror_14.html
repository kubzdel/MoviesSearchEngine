'''''Cabin Fever''''' is a 2002 American [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Eli Roth]] (in his directorial debut) and starring [[Rider Strong]], [[Jordan Ladd]], James DeBello, [[Cerina Vincent]], [[Joey Kern]], and [[Giuseppe Andrews]]. The story follows a group of college graduates who rent a cabin in the woods and begin to fall victim to a [[flesh-eating virus]]. The inspiration for the film's story came from a real life experience during a trip to [[Iceland]] when Roth developed a skin infection.

==Plot==
A [[hermit]] walking in the woods encounters his dog, who has died of a bloody infection, and the hermit becomes infected. Meanwhile, college students Jeff, Marcy, Paul, Karen and Burt take a vacation to a remote cabin to celebrate [[spring break]]. Burt leaves to shoot squirrels but shoots the now disfigured and bloody hermit. Despite the hermit's pleas, Burt flees and remains silent about the incident.

The group gather around a campfire that night, where they are joined by a friendly [[drifter (person)|drifter]] named Grimm and his pet dog, Dr. Mambo. When it rains, Grimm leaves with his dog to pack up his belongings. While the friends wait for Grimm indoors, the hermit returns, begging for help. When Burt shuts the door on the sick hermit, he tries stealing the group's car while vomiting blood. When the hermit approaches Marcy and Karen, Paul accidentally sets him on fire. While seeking help the next day, Jeff and Burt encounters a butcher but leave after learning she is the dead hermit's cousin. Paul receives assistance from police Deputy Winston, who promises to send up a tow truck. Paul tries comforting Karen, who is upset over the killing of the hermit. After calming her down, Paul attempts sex with her; as he reaches between her legs, he discovers an infection in her groin. The group isolates her in a shed.

After fixing the truck, Burt coughs up blood but does not tell the others. Burt drives off after Paul and Jeff discover he has caught the disease. Jeff takes the remaining beer and leaves, terrified of becoming infected. Burt seeks help at a convenience store but incurs the wrath of the owner after his son, Dennis, bites him. Burt flees, chased by Dennis's father and two friends. At the cabin, Marcy worries that they will all contract the disease. When Paul comforts her, they impulsively have sex. Regretting the affair, Paul leaves while Marcy takes a bath, crying; as she shaves her legs the flesh begins to peel off and she runs outside in a panic, where she is mauled by Dr. Mambo.

Paul discovers the hermit's corpse floating in a reservoir and realizes the infection is spreading through the drinking water. Racing back to the cabin, Paul finds Marcy's remains and Dr. Mambo feeding on Karen. After killing Dr. Mambo with Burt's gun, he bludgeons Karen with a shovel out of mercy. A dying Burt returns to the cabin pursued by Dennis's father and his two companions. The posse shoots and kills Burt, and Paul kills all three of them. Paul looks for Jeff; he instead finds Grimm's corpse. Paul takes the convenience store's truck, and, while driving, discovers he is infected before hitting a deer. He reunites with Deputy Winston, who is partying with underage drinkers. Paul requests a ride to the hospital, but before the group departs, Winston is ordered to kill on sight several infected people on a killing spree. With the group turning on him, Paul attacks and infects several of Winston's friends before knocking Winston out. A passing truck drops off Paul at a hospital, where he weakly discusses how he caught the disease. The doctors inform the sheriff that Paul must be transferred. Laying in the back of Winston's squad car, Paul unsuccessfully warns him about the contaminated drinking water; Winston dumps him at the edge of a creek.

Jeff, who has been hiding out and drinking in the woods, returns to the cabin the next day. Initially crying after seeing the remains of his friends, he becomes ecstatic upon realizing he is the only survivor. As he raises his arms in victory, Winston shoots him and burns his body with the others. At the convenience store, several children sell lemonade, which they have made with the water from the creek Paul was dumped in, to the same police officers. A large truck filled with bottles of water taken from the creek can be seen leaving the store.

==Production==
===Writing===
[[Eli Roth]] co-wrote ''Cabin Fever'' with friend and former [[New York University|NYU]] roommate Randy Pearlstein in 1995 while Roth was working as a production assistant for [[Howard Stern]]'s ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35838/eli-roth-talks-cabin-fever-hostel-3-endangered-species-thanksgiving-and-more|title=Eli Roth Talks Cabin Fever, Hostel 3, Endangered Species, Thanksgiving and More!|accessdate=December 22, 2013|archivedate=December 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228130559/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35838/eli-roth-talks-cabin-fever-hostel-3-endangered-species-thanksgiving-and-more|work=Dread Central|date=February 11, 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Early attempts to sell the script were unsuccessful because studios felt that the horror genre had become unprofitable.<ref name="RothCommentary">Roth, Eli. ''Cabin Fever'' [[DVD]], [[Lions Gate Entertainment]], 2004, [[audio commentary]]. ASIN: B0000ZG054</ref> In 1996, the film ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' was released to great success, leading studios to once again become interested in horror properties. Roth still could not sell his script, as studios told him that it should be more like ''Scream''.<ref name="RothCommentary" /> Many potential financiers also found the film's content to be unsettling, including not only the gore but also the use of the word "[[nigger]]" early in the film.

Roth was inspired to write the script based on his own experience with a skin infection he transmitted while traveling abroad. Various elements of the script were inspired by Roth's favorite horror films, including ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974), ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite book|title=Consuming Gothic: Food and Horror in Film|author=Piatti-Farrell, Lorna|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn= 978-1-137-45051-7|p=39}}</ref>

===Casting===
The auditions for the character of Marcy had been scheduled to take place on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].<ref name="RothCommentary" /> The scene the producers had chosen for the auditioning actresses was the build-up to Marcy's sex scene with Paul. In the scene, Marcy is convinced that all the students are doomed and despite Paul's reassurances, she describes their situation as "like being on a plane, when you know it's gonna crash. Everybody around you is screaming 'We're Going Down! We're Going Down!' and all you want to do is grab the person next to you and fuck them, because you know you're going to be dead soon, anyway." Eli Roth and the producers tried to cancel the Marcy auditions, but the general chaos caused by the attacks made it impossible for them to reach many of the actresses who were scheduled to try out for the role.

===Filming===
Roth originally wanted [[Cerina Vincent]] to show her naked buttocks during her [[Sex in film|sex scene]] with [[Rider Strong]]. Vincent, who had previously played a nude [[foreign exchange student]]  in ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'' was afraid that exposing too much of herself would lead to being typecast as a nudity actress and vehemently refused to bare her buttocks. At the peak of this stand-off between actress and director, Vincent told Roth that if he wanted the shot so badly, he would need to re-cast the role of Marcy with another actress. But they managed to reach a compromise - Cerina would bare exactly one inch of her buttocks on camera, no more, no less. Eli Roth brought a ruler along to the filming<ref name="Cerina's One Inch">{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/cerina-refused-to-do-nude-scene| author=WENN| title= Cerina Refused To Bare Rear|  work=[[Contactmusic.com]]| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref> and measured Cerina's buttocks, to be sure he got his one inch. Bedsheets were then taped to Vincent's backside at the designated level and the scene was filmed. Only the second (behind-the-back) shot features this one inch, in the first (over-the-shoulder) shot, the bedsheets cover Cerina's buttocks completely.

===Musical score===
Composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] agreed to compose some [[Film score|musical themes]] for the film out of enthusiasm for the material. However, the bulk of the film's score was composed by Nathan Barr, who has gone on to score both of Eli's [[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]] films. 

Some of the music selected for the film was deliberately chosen by Roth for their connection to other horror films; in the opening scene for example, while the main characters are driving to the cabin, "The Road Leads to Nowhere", a song written and recorded for ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972), is playing on the radio.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Lerner, Neil|title=Music in the Horror Film: Listening to Fear|p=110|author=Tompkins, Joe|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn= 978-1-135-28044-4}}</ref>
