=== Reviews ===
Emine Yıldırım, writing for ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', states, ''Surely the film does not present anything new to the genre, but it at least does not smell like a rotten Hollywood rip-off thanks to its spatter of local motifs and cultural references without the usual misogyny of female torture.'' ''The strong and weak points of “Ses” seem to stem from the same place -- its high regard for illustrating an intelligent and psychological thriller of depth where the expected scares serve the purpose of the main human story of dysfunctional and traumatized families -- yet the scenes which specifically highlight the drama and not the suspense tend to perform weakly as the emotional dynamic between the characters could have been more engaging,'' the reviewer adds, before going on to state, ''For the most part, the film’s real theme (which cannot be revealed at this point for spoilers) is so familiar to Turkish culture that it achieves in portraying a remarkable zeitgeist that no other films of related genres have been able to present.'' The reviewer concludes, ''All things considered, Ünal brings a well-crafted tale of agony (the kind of agony that’s worth pondering) with the help of astounding cinematography from Türksoy Gölebeyi, tight editing from Çiçek Kahraman and Natalin Solakoğlu, mesmerizingly painful art direction from Elif Taşçıoğlu and not to mention the powerful sound design (which holds the motif skeleton of the film) by Burak Topalakçı and Sascha Walker. Kudos to the cast and crew, who bring a film catering to all tastes, mainstream and independent.''<ref name="TZ01">{{cite web |title=‘Ses’ The Wisdom of Your Inner Voice? |first=Emine  |last=Yıldırım |coauthors= |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-203468-112-ses-the-wisdom-of-your-inner-voice.html |work=twitch |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10 }}</ref>

Emrah Güler, writing for ''[[Hürriyet Daily News and Economic Review|Hürriyet Daily News]]'', calls the film, ''One of the most anticipated Turkish films of the year,'' and recommends it to, ''Those who have become sick of Turkish horror movies with Islamic motifs and poor stories and want to try a fresh look at the genre.''<ref name="HDN01" />

Todd Brown, writing for ''[[Twitch Film]]'', describes the film as, ''An atmospheric thriller with dark supernatural overtones,'' that is, ''The latest title to try'' ''to be a true breakout hit to put Turkey on the map for genre film lovers,'' and comments that it, ''boasts a very aggressive trailer that promises good things.''<ref name="twitch01">{{cite web |title=Turkey Gets Creepy with Supernatural Thriller Ses (Voice) |first=Todd |last=Brown |coauthors= |url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2010/03/turkey-gets-creepy-with-supernatural-thriller-ses-voice.php |work=twitch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18 }}</ref>
