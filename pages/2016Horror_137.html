==Reception==
''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave the film three and a half out of four skulls saying "The film doesn’t capture that same success that the first film had, but it’s still a worthy follow-up for those who enjoyed the original."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3423605/review-stake-land-ii-worthy-flawed-follow/ |title= Indie [Review] ‘Stake Land II’ Is A Worthy (But Flawed) Follow-Up |last=Torfe |first=Pat |date=2017-02-06 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref> ''[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]'' said "While Stake Land II is clearly working on a small budget, the filmmakers do all they can to deliver a fast-moving post-apocalyptic “quest” movie full of gory vampire attacks, colorful stock character archetypes, and a slyly surly attitude."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nerdist.com/stake-land-ii-is-another-slice-of-post-apocalyptic-vampire-horror-review/ |title=Stake Land II is Another Slice of Post-Apocalyptic Vampire Horror (Review) |last=Weinberg |first=Scott |date=2017-02-14 |website=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] |access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref> ''[[Dread Central]]'' found the film mildly disappointing saying "Overall, the film acts as a serviceable addition to the story, but the regrettable element is that it could have been so much more – still is worth a watch for fans who sharpened their fangs on the first movie."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/213443/stake-land-ii-2017/ |title=Stake Land II (Blu-ray/DVD) |last=Boiselle |first=Matt |date=2017-02-08 |website=[[Dread Central]] |access-date=2017-10-04}}</ref>
