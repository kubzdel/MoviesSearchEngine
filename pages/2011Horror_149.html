'''''Scream 4''''' (stylized as '''''SCRE4M''''') is a 2011 American [[slasher film]] and the fourth installment in the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' series]]. Directed by [[Wes Craven]] (his final feature film before his death in 2015) and written by [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] (who returned to the series after writing the first two films), the film stars an [[ensemble cast]], which includes [[David Arquette]], [[Neve Campbell]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Emma Roberts]], [[Hayden Panettiere]], [[Anthony Anderson]], [[Alison Brie]], [[Adam Brody]], [[Rory Culkin]], [[Marielle Jaffe]], [[Erik Knudsen]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Marley Shelton]], [[Nico Tortorella]], [[Aimee Teegarden]] and [[Britt Robertson]] . The plot involves [[Sidney Prescott]] returning to Woodsboro after ten years, as part of her book tour. As soon as she arrives, [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High.

Originally, the series was intended to be a [[trilogy]], but film production for a fourth installment was approved by [[Bob Weinstein]]. Filming took place in and around [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], from June 2010 to September 2010, with re-shoots in early 2011.

''Scream 4'' was released on April 15, 2011 and grossed $97 million against its $40 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many noted it as an improvement over ''[[Scream 3]]''.

==Plot==
<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before expanding the plot.  Film plots should be 400–700 words long. -->
On the fifteenth anniversary of [[Scream (1996 film)|the original Woodsboro massacre,]] high school students [[List of Scream characters#Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper|Jenny Randall]] and [[List of Scream characters#Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper|Marnie Cooper]] are attacked and brutally murdered by a new [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]].

The following day, [[Sidney Prescott]] returns to Woodsboro to promote her new book with her publicist [[List of Scream characters#Rebecca Walters|Rebecca Walters]]. After evidence is found in Sidney's rental car, Sidney becomes a suspect in the murders and must stay in town until the murders are solved. Sidney's cousin, [[List of Scream characters#Jill Roberts|Jill]], who is dealing with the betrayal of her ex-boyfriend, [[List of Scream characters#Trevor Sheldon|Trevor Sheldon]], gets a threatening phone call from Ghostface, as does her friend [[List of Scream characters#Olivia Morris|Olivia Morris]]. Jill and Olivia, alongside their friend [[List of Scream characters#Kirby Reed|Kirby Reed]], are questioned about their calls by [[List of Scream characters#Dewey Riley|Dewey Riley]], who is now the sheriff, while one of his deputies, [[List of Scream characters#Deputy Judy Hicks|Judy Hicks]], assists him in the case. Meanwhile, Dewey's wife, [[Gale Weathers|Gale Weathers-Riley]], is struggling with [[writer's block]] and decides to investigate the murder instead.

Sidney stays with Jill and her aunt [[List of Scream characters#Kate Roberts|Kate Roberts]]. Later that night, Olivia, who lives next door to Jill and Kate, is attacked and killed by Ghostface as Jill and Kirby watch in horror. Sidney and Jill rush in to save Olivia, but the killer injures them and gets away; Sidney and Jill are taken to the hospital. In the hospital's parking garage, Ghostface murders Rebecca. Gale, trying to solve the murders, enlists the help of two high school movie fanatics, [[List of Scream characters#Charlie Walker|Charlie Walker]] and [[List of Scream characters#Robbie Mercer|Robbie Mercer]], who explain that the killer is using the rules of movie remakes. Charlie concludes that the killer will likely strike at a party being held that night.

Gale goes to the party to investigate. Ghostface injures her but flees when Dewey arrives. Dewey takes her to the hospital. At Jill's house, Sidney discovers that the policemen assigned to guard the house are dead. She also discovers that Jill has left the house and gone to Kirby's. Sidney goes down to tell Kate, but the killer appears, kills Kate, and disappears again. After Deputy Judy Hicks arrives, Sidney rushes to Kirby's house to save Jill on her own. 

Jill, Kirby, Charlie, Robbie and Trevor are at Kirby's house when Ghostface appears and murders a drunken Robbie. Sidney arrives at the house. Kirby is forced to answer horror movie trivia to save Charlie, who is tied up and gagged outside. Sidney goes upstairs to find Jill, promising to return to Kirby. After Kirby answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to untie Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as Ghostface, before leaving her for dead. Sidney is confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is revealed as Jill. Jill explains that her motive was out of anger and jealousy because of the fame that Sidney had received for surviving the murders, and that they intend to frame Trevor as Ghostface; she then pulls a bound and gagged Trevor out of a closet and shoots him in the head. Jill then betrays Charlie and kills him, too, to pin him as Trevor's accomplice and to make herself the sole survivor. Jill stabs Sidney in the stomach and mutilates herself to make it seem as if Trevor attacked her. Later, Dewey, Judy, and the rest of the police stumble upon the carnage.

Sidney and Jill are then taken to the hospital. After discovering that Sidney had survived, she goes to Sidney's hospital room and attempts to finish her. Dewey, Gale, and Judy intervene, having been clued by a detail about Gale's injury that Jill somehow knew. Jill subdues Sidney's rescuers, which gives Sidney the chance to shoot her in the chest, finally killing her. Dewey calls in all police units, as media reporters outside confirm Jill as "the new Sidney Prescott", a title that would be short lived.

==Production==
===Development===
''Scream 4'' was announced by [[The Weinstein Company]] in July 2008,<ref name="Fletcher2008"/> with [[Wes Craven]] saying that he would not mind directing the film if the script was as good as ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''.<ref name="Paste"/> In March 2010 it was confirmed that he would indeed direct.<ref name="Dread1"/> 

In May 2010, [[Cathy Konrad]], who produced the first three films in the series, filed a $3 million lawsuit against The Weinstein Company, alleging that they violated a written agreement that entitled her company, Cat Entertainment, first rights to produce all films in the series.<ref name="Reuters" /> The Weinsteins argued that this contract required Konrad's services be exclusive to the franchise, which Konrad calls "false pretext", claiming the previous film did not require this condition.<ref name="Reuters" /> The suit accuses the Weinsteins of surreptitious behavior and "a scheme to force Plaintiffs to walk away from the ''Scream'' franchise without compensation,"<ref name="Reuters" /> enabling them to cut costs by hiring someone else to produce (Craven's wife, Iya Labunka, not named in the suit).<ref name="the wrap" /> In April 2011, it was reported that the Weinsteins had settled out of court with Konrad, the details remaining confidential, though it was claimed that she would receive a cash payment plus a percentage of the profits from ''Scream 4''.<ref name="ConradScream4"/>

===Writing===
Craven stated that within the ten years that have passed between ''Scream 3'' and ''Scream 4'', there have been no "real life" [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] murders but have been numerous sequels to the [[Story within a story|film-within-a-film]] ''Stab''. He also commented on the life status of Sidney Prescott, "She's done her best to move on from the events that occurred in the previous films, even releasing a successful book". Craven said that endless sequels, the modern spew of remakes, film studios, and directors are the butts of parodies in the film. The main characters have to figure out where the horror genre is in current days to figure out the modern events happening to and around them.<ref name="EW"/>

In an early draft of the script, Gale and Dewey had a baby, but this was changed after it was decided bringing a baby into the film would make shooting "impossible". In another early form of the script, the opening scene had Sidney go head-to-head with Ghostface and be left for dead. There would have been a two-year gap in the story while she recovered; however, Bob Weinstein feared it would slow the pace of the story and bringing in young characters would work out best.<ref name="EWScripChanges"/>

''[[Scream 3]]'' writer [[Ehren Kruger]] was brought in during production to do re-writes. Craven said, "Look, there was a bumpy period when things shifted over from Kevin to Ehren. I signed up to do a script by Kevin and unfortunately that didn't go all the way through the shooting. But it certainly is Kevin's script and concept and characters and themes".<ref name="TotalFilm"/> Additional rewrites were made by [[Paul Harris Boardman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alumni.jhu.edu/event/hopkins-hollywood|title=Hopkins in Hollywood {{!}} Johns Hopkins Alumni|website=alumni.jhu.edu|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://filmhub.net/people/KXDydB|title=Paul Harris|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref> It was reported that the actors were not given the 140-page script<ref name="cameo"/> past page 75 in order to protect the identity of the Ghostface killer.<ref name="the wrap2"/>

===Casting===
[[File:Emma Roberts 2011 alt2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Emma Roberts at the film's premiere at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]].]]
In September 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Neve Campbell]], [[David Arquette]], and [[Courteney Cox]] would return.<ref name="variety"/> Craven briefly explained their roles in a later interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', saying "It's a total integration of those three and new kids. The story of Sid, Gale, and Dewey is very much a part of the movie."<ref name="EW"/> At a [[press conference]] for ''[[Repo Men]]'', [[Liev Schreiber]]—who played [[Cotton Weary]] in the first three films—stated there were no plans for his reprisal.<ref name="BD1"/> In an interview with [[FEARnet]], Williamson continued to deny a rumor of [[Jamie Kennedy]] returning, "I would love nothing more than to have Jamie Kennedy in the film. However to have Randy in the film, it sort of just takes it... I mean ''Scream 2'' was a lie, you know? It's a false move. So I just won't do it. I can't do that. I just won't do it."<ref name="FEARnet"/> In April, over 12 casting sides were released to the public to buy for auditions of the film.<ref name="Showfax"/>

In May 2010, [[Hayden Panettiere]] and [[Rory Culkin]] signed on.<ref name="variety2"/> [[Ashley Greene]] was offered the role of Sidney's cousin, Jill, but the role later went to [[Emma Roberts]].<ref name="AshleyGreene"/> [[Lake Bell]] was to play Deputy Judy Hicks, but dropped out four days before filming due to scheduling conflicts, causing the role to ultimately go to [[Marley Shelton]].<ref name="DS2"/> [[Nancy O'Dell]] reprises her role from the second and third films as a [[List of Scream characters#Reporter|reporter]].<ref name="zap2it"/> [[Roger L. Jackson]] returned as the voice of [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]].<ref name="BD2"/> [[Lauren Graham]] was to play Kate Roberts, the mother of Roberts' character, but dropped out a few days into principal photography.<ref name="Fearnet"/><ref name="DS"/> Craven, like in the previous three films, has a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] and took to his [[Twitter]] to ask fans to pick his role (the cameo was, however, deleted from the final cut of the film).<ref name="dread2"/> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that [[Anna Paquin]] and [[Kristen Bell]] have [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]s in the beginning of the film akin to [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] in the first and second ''Scream''.<ref name="cameo"/> [[Shenae Grimes]] and [[Lucy Hale]] also have cameos in the film.<ref name="cameo2"/>

===Filming===

[[File:Scream 4 filming.jpg|thumb|Cast of movie on the set in July 2010]]
On a budget of $40 million, [[principal photography]] began on June&nbsp;28, 2010.<ref name="EW"/> Filming was scheduled to end on September&nbsp;6, after a 42-day shoot, but instead concluded on September&nbsp;24.<ref name="cameo"/> Filming took place in and around [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref name="budget"/><ref name="Freep"/> Scenes portraying Woodsboro High School featured in the original ''Scream'' film were shot at Woodworth Middle School in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].<ref name="HS"/> The former 16th District Court in [[Livonia, Michigan]] was used as a police station.<ref name="court"/>

In April&nbsp;2010, while scouting for a bookstore to use in the film, Craven spotted a new bookstore that had not yet opened in downtown [[Northville, Michigan]] named Next Chapter Bookstore Bistro. Craven instantly loved the building as well as the name and decided to use both in the film. He also hired the owner's chef to prepare the food and pastry for a scene in the film. The scenes were shot the first week of July.<ref name="freep2"/> After the test screening in January, Craven and Weinstein did not think two scenes played well for the audience. Aimee Teegarden and Alison Brie returned to Detroit in late January and early February 2011 for four days of additional shooting. The scenes involved Teegarden's character who is stalked at her home and Brie's character who is attacked in a parking garage.<ref name="EWPreviewpg35"/><ref name="Northville"/><ref name="EWnewscenes"/>

The film also extensively used [[computer-generated imagery]] for the first time in the franchise. For example, instead of using a "collapsing knife", the knife's blade was added during post-production with CGI effects.<ref name="ABCScreamPg3"/> Anderson's death scene in which he is stabbed in the forehead and walks a few feet while talking before finally falling to his death, was not in the script but was inspired by a "real-life medical emergency" Craven had seen in a documentary about a person being stabbed through their head and walked into an emergency room. He thought it was "extraordinary if somebody was stabbed in the head and still be alive for a while". Craven also did not tell the studio that he was taking this approach for the death scene, jokingly saying he hoped he would not be fired the next day.<ref name="MTVdeath"/>
