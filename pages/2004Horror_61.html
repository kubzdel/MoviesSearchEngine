==Plot==
''I Pass for Human'' follows the downward spiral of Jane (Eleanor Whitledge) following the heroin overdose and death of her boyfriend, Dax (Bryan Small). Jane soon finds herself using heroin herself to cope with the pain of mourning, as well as the shock of haunting visions of Dax following her. Finding heroin alone inadequate, in short order she replaces Dax with the company of new beau Rick (Josh Coxx). Not only is Rick a heroin addict, but he also has a dead significant other, Azami, whose jealousy apparently follows him from beyond the grave. The film plays on the conceit that heroin addicts escape death; in ''I Pass for Human'', heroin leaves its users never quite dead, yet never quite alive.<ref name="variety" /><ref name="tcm" />
