There is something horribly wrong with the bodies found in the dark city streets. Some are mutilated while others have the [[Price equation]] (wΔz = Cov (w,z) = βwzVz) carved into their flesh. Detective Eddie Argo and his new partner Helen Westcott unearth the meaning of the odd equation and realise each victim is being offered a gruesome choice: kill your loved ones, or be killed. Before long it becomes clear that the perpetrator has suffered a similar fate and is now coping by seeking a way to solve this philosophical dilemma.

''CHUD.com'' said of the film, "Director Tom Shankland paints a grimy portrait that fits well with the Clive Bradley script. It is a great debut for both filmmakers who created a movie that works on almost every level."<ref>[http://www.chud.com/16046/dvd-review-killing-gene-the-unrated/ Chud.com]</ref>

''[[DVD Talk]]'' wrote, "But let's not kid ourselves: This is a nasty horror thriller that has a ''[[Class of 1984]]'' feel to it, although it has the most in common with the [[Saw series|''Saw'' series]] (even the line "Oh yes, there will be blood!" is morphed into "But there will be pain!"). It's not quite as outlandishly brutal, but it's still pretty mean."<ref>[http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/34661/killing-gene-unrated-the/ DVD Talk]</ref>

''[[Fortean Times]]'' said, "While the plot twists rarely come as a surprise, the film's grimy feel and effective pacing, and a gripping - if occasionally rather over-exaggerated - central performance by Skarsgård, make this a genuinely thrilling venture into ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'' territory, despite the unfortunate silliness of the title."<ref>[http://www.forteantimes.com/reviews/films/1008/wz.html Forteantimes.com]</ref>
