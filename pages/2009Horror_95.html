==Production==
Work began on ''The Haunted World of El Superbeasto'' in 2006 and a release date was later scheduled for May 2007, but the film was completed in 2009. In an interview conducted on July 20, 2007 by ''shocktillyoudrop.com'', Zombie explained that, "Nothing really much [is happening]." During that time, the film was still being animated, however, Zombie then began work on ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]''. He informed the animators that he had "to walk away because I can't split my time between two things". Zombie noted that work on ''The Haunted World of El Superbeasto'' "started when I was on ''[[The Devil's Rejects|Rejects]]'' and it's now just sitting on a shelf waiting for me to finish ''Halloween''".<ref name="Shocktillyoudrop">{{cite web| publisher= Shocktillyoudrop| url= http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=825 | title=News: EXCL: Rob Zombie Interview | accessdate= July 20, 2007}}</ref>

In a November 2007 interview with [[Bloody Disgusting]], Zombie announced that the film was "almost finished". He went on to say that, although he was then on tour until February, "we will finally finish the music on Superbeasto and it'll be done" afterwards.<ref name="Bloody-Disgusting.com">{{cite web| publisher= Bloody-Disgusting| url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/434 | title=Halloween DVD: Rob Zombie Clears the Air | accessdate= November 28, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129192153/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/feature/434 | archivedate = November 29, 2007}}</ref>

Rob Zombie had the following to say in a September 28, 2008 posting on the official ''El Superbeasto'' [[Myspace]] page: "We're down to the end! 3 long years in the making and worth every second. By Halloween this thing will be in the can completely DONE!"

According to a [[blog]] post on October 29, 2008, ''Defamer Magazine'' was privy to a "sneak peek" at scenes from ''The Haunted World of El Superbeasto'', about which they said "it's good to know that if ''[[WALL-E]]'' falls short on its quest for [[Academy Award|Oscar]] gold, we now have another animated contender."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defamer.com/5070445/only-defamer-has-seen-footage-of-rob-zombies-new-masturbation-friendly-animated-film|title=Only Defamer Has Seen Footage of Rob Zombie's New, 'Masturbation Friendly' Animated Film}}</ref>

In an October 29, 2008, ''[[Blender Magazine]]'' interview, Rob Zombie stated that "I've been working on [''El Superbeasto''] for three years, and I'm actually in the last weeks of it â€” I'm mixing the sound this week. I'm not sure of the release date yet, but that'll be out probably early 2009. It's a full-length adult animated comedy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/BlenderBlogNewPost10292008/Blender-Blog/blogs/1168/44808.aspx|title=Halloween Q&A: Rob Zombie on His Next Movie (Animated), His Next Album (Collaborative) and His Favorite Way to Scare Trick-or-Treaters (Severed Body Parts)}}</ref> The film was screen-tested for a 2009 release by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Zombie+Lovers,+UNITE/articles/122/El+Superbeasto+Rob+Zombies+Cartoon+Movie|title=El Superbeasto: Rob Zombies Cartoon Movie}}</ref>

[[IGN]]'s March 20, 2009 exclusive interview with Rob Zombie revealed that "[''The Haunted World of El Superbeasto''] was finished, but its release had been delayed because of ownership and legal issues within the company that made the movie, [[Starz Media]]." In that same interview, Rob Zombie described the film as "Awesome...this little tiny half-a-million dollar direct-to-video movie that expanded into this $10 million animated extravaganza. And it's awesome, but I don't have a release date yet. It's like an R-rated adult/monster/sex comedy. There's nothing really like it that I can think of. People always say like [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s stuff, but...it's [more] like if [[SpongeBob SquarePants|SpongeBob]] and [[Scooby-Doo]] were filthy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/964/964983p1.html|title=Exclusive: Zombie Talks T-Rex|author=Scott Collura}}</ref> The film, running feature length at 75 minutes, was released on [[DVD]] on September 22 of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16569|title='The Haunted World of El Superbeasto' Finally Getting Released!}}</ref> A majority of the songs in the film are written and performed by [[Chris Hardwick]] and [[Mike Phirman]]'s comedy duo [[Hard 'n Phirm]].

Director Rob Zombie also references several other films. Tom Papa, writer and the voice of the titular character, incorporated his style of humor into his character. Throughout the film, El Superbeasto often makes observations at unusual moments, like Papa does in his stand-ups.
