'''''Frostbite''''' (Swedish title: '''''Frostbiten''''') is a Swedish [[comedy]] [[horror film]] from 2006 directed by [[Anders Banke]].

As well as the horror theme, various parts also have pure humour elements, and it is considered a horror/comedy by some newspapers that rated it. The film takes place in a small town in northern Sweden during [[midwinter]], making the environment perfect for vampires—because there are no sunny hours during the dark and cold Nordic winter days.

== Plot ==
During [[World War II]] in Ukraine, 1944, the remnants of [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking]] are fleeing from [[The Red Army]]. They seek shelter in an abandoned cabin, but as darkness falls they are attacked by [[vampires]] inhabiting a hidden crypt under the cabin.

In present-day Sweden, doctor Annika and her teenage daughter Saga are moving to a town in [[Lapland, Sweden|Lappland]], so Annika can work close to the famous geneticist Gerhard Beckert. The [[polar night]] has begun, with one month until dawn, much to Saga's dismay.

Saga finds a friend in the enigmatic [[goth fashion|gothgirl]] Vega, who invites her to a party. Saga decides to go, having nothing better to do. At the local hospital the medical student Sebastian finds some pills which Beckert has been treating a comatose patient. Sebastian thinks the pills are drugs and tries them. But rather than getting high, he starts to develop acute hearing and improved vision, is able to talk to dogs and tormented by extreme thirst. Vega shows up at Sebastian's house to pick up the drugs she paid him to provide for the party. Sebastian tells her he has forgotten to get them, but as Sebastian rushes to meet his girlfriend Cornelia's parents, Vega finds the pills and steals them.

At the hospital, Annika looks after the coma patient who suddenly bites her. Annika looks to Beckert for aid, but he knocks her unconscious when he realises what has happened. It turns out that Beckert is the last survivor of the massacred platoon who after a showdown in the cabin was left the only survivor together with a child vampire named Maria. Beckert brought Maria to northern Sweden with the intention to create a cure for vampirism, but eventually  he changed direction to create a [[master race|new species of human-vampire hybrides]]. The pills are capsules of vampire blood Beckert has used to covertly spread and study vampirism. Annika manages to free herself and fight off Beckert who turns into a monstrous vampire form. Annika drives a stake into Beckerts heart and runs him over with an ambulance, destroying him.

Vega gives the pills to John - the party host - who consumes a pill. John puts the remainder in a bowl of punch to live up the party, unwittingly infecting multiple guest including Vega. John eventually turns into a vampire and starts mauling his guests. As others succumb to vampirism, the party turn into a bloodbath. Saga hides in the basement, but is attacked by Vega. Saga manages to escape into the backyard, followed by Vega. Saga impales Vega on a garden gnome, who disgruntedly complains about her undignified death. The police arrive to investigate noise complaints (the neighbours mistake the vampires for drugusers), and are soon overrun by the vampires. Saga is driven off in an ambulance as the vampires surround the police. John taunts them by saying ''Don't worry. This will be over any minute. Dawn is... just a month away!''

In the ambulance Saga encounters Maria who tells her that they will be sisters. As Saga looks to the driver seat she sees Annika looking back with red vampire eyes.

== Production ==
The first draft of ''Frostbiten'' was finished in 1998. Ander Banke and Magnus Paulsson had been trying to make a Swedish horror film for years but with little success, until a script by Daniel Ojanlatva was sent to them about vampires showing up in [[Norrland]]. Daniel Ojanlatva had grown up in [[Kiruna]] and thought it was just right to add vampires. Originally the film was set to be a ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''-style movie with several stories and characters who went in and out of them. It was going to be called ''Something Wicked this Way Comes''. Pidde Andersson joined the crew and did some work on the dialog and suggested the new title ''Frostbiten''. The movie was mostly shot in [[Kalix]] in the winter of 2005 and the board scenes were shot in the Ystad Studios. [[Anthony Lledo]], who had worked with Anders Banke before, was selected to write the score. The producers drew inspiration from vampire films such as ''[[The Lost Boys]]'', ''[[Fright Night]]'', ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' and [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[Bad Taste]]''.

[[Petra Nielsen]] was cast as Annika; she was always Banke's first choice for the part. Grete Havensköld, who had starred in [[Astrid Lindgren]] films as a child, was cast as Annika's daughter Saga. [[Per Löfberg]] had been in the hit [[romantic comedy|romcom]] ''Ha ett underbart liv'' and in the cult film ''[[Evil Ed]]'' and was cast in a then-secret role, and Carl-Åke Eriksson had played small parts in several films and television series was cast as the professor. Most of the cast were selected in open auditions.

The producers had trouble finding a Swedish distributor for their film, until [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] took over the DVD sales after seeing only the 20 first minutes of the film.<ref>http://www.ystadsallehanda.se/kultur-och-noje/noje/article701973/Hisnande-blodigt-filmaumlventyr.html</ref>

In the promotion, mostly through the now defunct Beckert website, moviegoers were deceived that Gerhard Beckert would be the "[[Abraham van Helsing]]" of the film.

==Special effects==
''Frostbiten'' was the most special-effects-heavy film ever made in Sweden at that time, and two companies were employed to handle them. Swedish effect company Fido Film and Ulitka Post, the same team who did special effects for ''[[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]]''. The special effects were delayed as several of the animators were employed for [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''. Ulitka Post created the opening title, removed wires and created the long, physically impossible take in the cabin scene. Fido Film and [[Kaj Steveman]] did all the creature design, created the different vampires, animated the talking mouths on the dogs and created the knife stabbings. CGI and practical effects were heavily mixed. The hideous supervampire that appears at the end was played by actor Kristian Pehrsson wearing a full body suit. The suit took over 6 weeks to make and Pehrsson was unable to defecate and to sit down while wearing it.<ref>http://www.sydsvenskan.se/kultur--nojen/nu-flodar-blodet-i-svensk-film/</ref> His ears were glued  tightly to his head and every inch of his body was covered in the tight foam latex suit. Over 300 fx shots are in the film, which was the Swedish record until [[Kenny Begins]] beat the record. Frostbite is currently the second most effects heavy Swedish film of all time.

==Music==
The music was composed by [[Anthony Lledo]], conducted by [[Allan Wilson (conductor)|Allan Wilson]] and performed by the [[Slovak National Symphony Orchestra]] who later carried on their Swedish vampire legacy by performing the score of [[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]. An album featuring much of the score is available on iTunes Store. The score was very well received by critics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mania.com/symphonic-swede_article_53112.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926161546/http://www.mania.com/symphonic-swede_article_53112.html |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>http://www.goldenscores.com/?a=features&m=modern_scores&id=39</ref><ref>http://filmz.dk/artikler/soundtracks-varme-tv-stjerner-og-kolde-bid</ref> [[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]] called it ''one of the most stirring horror soundtracks in recent years''.<ref>http://www.kqek.com/mrh_cv/rue_morgue/RM_Mar_07.htm</ref>

Missing from the album is ''[[Tyomnaja Notch]]'' by [[Leonid Utyosov]] that is played over the opening credits. The name of the song means "Dark Night". Other than the score the soundtrack is mostly made up of Swedish pop- and rock-music, among those [[Millencolin]], [[Luleå]] hardcore punk band [[Raised Fist]], [[Langhorns]], [[Quit Your Dayjob]], [[Son Kite]] and then newcomers [[BWO (band)|BWO]]. ''Diabolic Scheme'' by [[The Hives]] is played over the closing credits.

==Release==
The film opened at [[Gothenburg Film Festival]] on February 3, 2006. At the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the movie was applauded, and sold for distribution to over 40 countries. According to the producers, and to director Anders Banke, ''Frostbiten'' became the first horror movie ever to be screened in [[North Korea]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://konvas.org/pipermail/cinema_konvas.org/2006-October/000387.html |author= Banke, Anders |authorlink= Anders Banke |date= October 6, 2006 |title= [Konvas] Frosbite (Adam Frey) |publisher= Konvas |accessdate= February 7, 2013 |quote= I just got back from the [[Pyongyang International Film Festival]], where ''Frostbite'' was the first horror film ever to screen in a North Korean cinema! An incredible experience. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a country like no other, and the same goes for their film festival. ''Frostbite'' is a horror comedy, more funny than scary, but as the comedy elements are often related to popular culture references not present in North Korea, most of the comedy was sort of lost on them, whereas - due to the majority of the audience never having seen a horror film before - the horror elements certainly got a reaction, with 40 year old party officials screaming like little children... |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130415072641/http://konvas.org/pipermail/cinema_konvas.org/2006-October/000387.html |archivedate= April 15, 2013 |df=  }}</ref> The movie was a big hit in Russia and launched Anders Banke's career in the Russian film industry.<ref>http://www.ystadsallehanda.se/tomelilla/article767503/Doldis-skapar-filmmagi.html</ref>

==Reception==
In Sweden the film was met with mediocre to negative reviews, with a few exceptions. The movie had average success at the box office in Sweden and seemed to be a failure.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} After Cannes, ''Frostbiten'' was by far the most popular Swedish movie on the foreign markets that year.

''[[Svensk Dagbladet]]'' gave the film a 3/6 score and praise the cinematography and special effects.<ref>http://www.svd.se/kultur/film/frostbiten_23861.svd</ref> ''Aftonbladet'' gave it a 3/5 score, calling it an enjoyable horror film.<ref>http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/puls/film/recension/0,1300,2000050244,00.html</ref> [[Expressen]] panned the film, calling it "a meaningless splatterfilm".<ref>http://www.expressen.se/noje/recensioner/film/frostbiten/</ref>  Swedish film site Moviemix gave the film a 5/6, but said the film did not deliver the splatter climax he wanted at the end.<ref>http://www.moviemix.nu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&catid=37:film&id=3852&Itemid=131</ref> A reviewer for the site ''Film Threat'' wrote, "Ever since ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' infiltrated the fear-film genre, something's been rotten in Transylvania. Playing horror for [[In-joke|winking insider references]] and juvenile giggles, any real juice has been extracted from the cutting-edge school of cinema that spawned ''[[Re-Animator]]'', ''[[Braindead (film)|Dead Alive]]'', and ''[[The Evil Dead (franchise)|Evil Dead]]'', three brilliant examples of horror that combined ferocious splatter with truly inspired humor. In comparison, ''Frostbite'' is too little, too late."<ref name= "threat" /> ''[[Göteborgs Posten]]'' gave the film another 3/5 score.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/film/1.69458-frostbiten-3-fyrar |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017230541/http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/film/1.69458-frostbiten-3-fyrar |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}</ref> as did ''Cinema'' and complained over the lack of a true character to the film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema.se/recensioner/frostbiten |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827153700/http://www.cinema.se/recensioner/frostbiten |archivedate=2010-08-27 |df= }}</ref> ''Film Forum'' on the other hand gave it a 4/5 score and cited it as a fresh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmforum.se/recensioner/dvd/frostbiten-1.466213.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418061102/http://www.filmforum.se/recensioner/dvd/frostbiten-1.466213.html |archivedate=2013-04-18 |df= }}</ref>

[[IGN]] gave it a 7 out of 10 score and said that, despite its shortcomings, it was very entertaining. The reviewer also pointed out that the setting was perfect and commented that the Swedish landscapes provided a wonderful backdrop for the movie's dark subject matter and that it looked beautiful in a very gruesome kind of way.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/18/frostbitten-dvd-review</ref>

The reception was better internationally; [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film 4/5, calling it a masterpiece, saying that the film had a strong cast, great special effects and the film the most enjoyable vampire film since the 80s, filling in: "''The way the screenplay is written is fantastic, as you can see above the film has many plants that grow and flourish into one hell of a film''".<ref>http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/110233/frostbitten-v/?tab=bd-review</ref> The horror site [[Eatmybrains]].com gave it 4/5 stars and comments: "''Banke’s film exhibits a laid back, droll sensibility perfectly in keeping with its national temperament, and has a unique deadpan sense of the comedic that perfectly complements the material without cheapening it''".<ref>http://www.eatmybrains.com/showreview.php?id=230</ref> [[Film4]] gave the film 3.5/5, saying that the wartime neutrality of Sweden theme and anxieties about migration (Becket dishonestly sneaking into Sweden and creating a master race) made the reviewer uncomfortable and it took away some of the fun.<ref>http://www.film4.com/reviews/2006/frostbite</ref>

Most critics praised Emma Åberg's performance as Vega, saying that she stole every scene she was in. Jonas Karlström also received praise for his part as the unfortunate intern Sebastian and mentioned the scene where the newly vampiric Sebastian meet Cornelia's priest father and is served garlic-braised trout as one of the film's strongest and funniest moments.

''Frostbiten'' won the best film award at [[Fantasporto]] and collected the several awards at [[Screamfest]].

[[Snarkerati]] ranked this ''Frostbite'' as the 43rd best vampire film based on critic rating statistics<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/top-70-vampire-movies-of-all-time/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006120729/http://snarkerati.com/movie-news/top-70-vampire-movies-of-all-time/ |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}</ref> and on December 26, 2012 [[IMDB]] listed Frostbite as the fourth most popular Swedish horror title.

==Title==
The title is an obvious play on [[frostbite]], because the movie takes place in a frozen environment and has vampires who bite people in it. The original title was ''Something Wicked This Way Comes'' (a [[Something wicked this way comes (phrase)|phrase]] from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' and also the title of [[Ray Bradbury]]'s [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|1962 novel]] and its 1983 [[Something Wicked This Way Comes (film)|film adaptation]]). The producers liked the title ''Frostbiten'' more since it was more international, and by just cutting the last letter they had an English title. Teasers and trailers on film festivals therefore wore the name ''Frostbite''. However, it was only called ''Frostbite'' in the United Kingdom. In the United States the movie is called ''Frostbitten'', the exact translation of the original title.

==Background==
''Frostbiten'' is Sweden's first [[vampire]] movie<ref name= "threat">{{cite web |url= http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/9047/ |author= Doughton, KJ |date= June 7, 2006 |title= Frostbite |publisher= [[Film Threat]] |accessdate= February 7, 2013}}</ref> (unless you consider [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s [[Hour of the Wolf]] to count).

==Analysis==
In an analysis of Swedish genre films such as ''Storm'' (2005; Swedish title: ''Tempestade'') and ''Kenny Begins'' (2009) by Dan Sjöström, ''Frosbite'' is discussed in detail.<ref>{{cite book |last= Sjöström |first= Dan |title= Kenny Begins, Frostbiten, Storm: Resultat av åldrande Genrer och Växande Filmproduktion |location= Gävle |publisher= [[Gävle University College]], Akademin för utbildning och ekonomi |year= 2012}}</ref>  He describes the vampires of ''Frostbite'' as representing several different types appearing in the genre; Beckert is in one way the stereotypical [[mad scientist]], but is also a loner vampire in the style of ''[[Count Orlok|Nosferatu]]'', residing in his castle (in this case the rundown town hospital). He describes the teen vampires as a more sadistic and brutal breed of the undead, an [[anarchist]] and aggressive pack straight out of ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.

Sjöström notes that, rather than joking away the horror, horror and comedy are wrapped tightly together, as in the scene where Saga walks into the aftermath of the bloodbath and encounters John, who laughs grimly at her with a [[helium]] voice, or as in the film's infamous "gnome-scene".

He lays weight on the fact that, while following traditional vampire mythology closely, the film puts it into context with modern Sweden. In the spirit of Swedish [[secularism]], the priest role in the film is reduced. He argues that if the film had been made in a more religious country, the priest would have been a main character, who would have provided information about the vampires and lead the fight against them. Instead, the teens know everything about vampires and are just surprised that they are real, rather than confused what to do. The filmmakers trust that the audience, much like the teens, know about vampires, so that information on how to fight vampires is obsolete.
<ref>http://hig.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:478446</ref>

Sarah Clyne Sundberg of [[Sweden.se]] suggested that the film possibly reflected unprocessed Swedish war guilt.<ref>http://blogs.sweden.se/film/2010/04/25/frostbite/</ref> She  also mentioned that the film had some great visual and verbal puns and described it as ''good old-fashioned gore fest''. [[Film4]] read the film in a similar way, stating: ''(B)uried somewhere amidst the monstrous transformations and belly laughs is an uncomfortable critique of Sweden's much-vaunted wartime neutrality, and her current anxieties about immigration. For this is the tale of a Nazi soldier finding refuge in Sweden with surprising ease, and continuing unchecked in a eugenics programme of his own (with bloodsuckers as the new master race) - and the locals either fail to notice what's happening in their midst or else fall in line with alarming gusto.''

''Frostbite'' is analysed along with ''Let the Right One In'' in the book ''New Vampire Cinema''.
