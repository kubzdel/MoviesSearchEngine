'''''The Haunted Mansion''''' is a 2003 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[comedy horror]] film based on the [[The Haunted Mansion|Disney theme park attraction of the same name]]. Directed by [[Rob Minkoff]], the film is written by David Berenbaum and stars [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Terence Stamp]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Marsha Thomason]], and [[Jennifer Tilly]].

The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 26, 2003 and is Disney's fourth film based on an attraction at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|one of its]] [[theme park]]s, following the [[television film]] [[Tower of Terror (film)|''Tower of Terror'']] (1997), ''[[The Country Bears]]'' (2002), and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003). The film grossed $182.3 million worldwide on a $90 million budget and received negative reviews from critics, citing lack of scares and humor.

==Plot==
The backstory to the film is briefly introduced through the main title sequence: Edward Gracey was a wealthy landowner in the eighteenth century, however he was misled into believing his love Elizabeth spurned him, and, believing her death by poison to be suicide, committed suicide himself by hanging.

Jim Evers ([[Eddie Murphy]]) is a [[workaholic]] [[Real estate broker|realtor]] whose continuous pursuit for new deals leaves very little time with his family. He misses his wedding anniversary with his wife Sara ([[Marsha Thomason]]), but to make amends, he suggests going on vacation to a nearby lake. Beforehand, Sara is contacted by the occupants of Gracey Manor, located in the [[Louisiana]] [[bayou]]. Eager to make a deal, Jim drags Sara and his children, impatient Megan ([[Aree Davis]]) and arachnophobic Michael ([[Marc John Jefferies]]) to the mansion. They meet its owner [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Master Gracey|Edward Gracey]] ([[Nathaniel Parker]]), his stern [[butler]] Ramsley ([[Terence Stamp]]), and other staff members Emma ([[Dina Waters]]) and Ezra ([[Wallace Shawn]]). When a storm floods the nearby river, Gracey allows the Evers family to stay the night; though everyone is safe, Jim is unhappy with the idea. Ramsley takes Jim to the mansion's library to discuss the deal with Gracey, but while he waits, Jim gets trapped in a [[secret passage]].

Megan and Michael encounter a spectral orb and follow it up to the attic, where they find a portrait of a woman resembling Sara. There they converse with Emma and Ezra; the former identifying the woman as "Elizabeth". Sara talks with Gracey in the library, who explains his grandfather hanged himself out of despair after his lover, a multiracial woman named Elizabeth Henshaw poisoned herself despite their plans to wed. Jim meets [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Madame Leota|Madame Leota]], a [[Romani people|Romani]] [[Magician (fantasy)|witch’s]] [[ghost]] whose head is encased in a [[crystal ball]], but she [[Fear|scares]] him away. Jim runs into his children, Emma and Ezra, and returns to Madame Leota for answers about Elizabeth's likeness to Sara. It is revealed that everyone in the mansion are ghosts, cursed a century ago by Gracey and Elizabeth's suicides and can only go to Heaven when they are reunited, and Gracey believes Sara is Elizabeth's reincarnation. Madame Leota sends the Evers off to the mansion's expansive [[cemetery]] to find a key that will reveal the truth behind Elizabeth's unusual death. Jim and Megan venture into a [[crypt]] beneath a mausoleum where they find the key, but inadvertently disturb its undead residents. They escape with help from Michael, who overcomes his [[arachnophobia]]. Madame Leota then leads them to a trunk in the attic, which Jim unlocks to find a letter written by Elizabeth to Gracey, revealing she truly loved him and wanted to marry him, leading them to conclude that she was murdered. Ramsley suddenly appears, revealing he murdered Elizabeth to prevent Gracey from abandoning his heritage, believing their relationship was unacceptable. To hide the truth, he traps the children in a trunk, throws Jim out of the house, and magically enchants the house so Jim cannot break in and stop him.

As Gracey and Sara rendezvous in the ballroom, the former asks Sara if she can recognize him which confuses her. Desperate, he insists to Sara that she is his beloved Elizabeth. The room fills with dancing ghosts of the past which causes Sara to flee. As she runs through the corridors, Gracey reveals his true ghost-self to Sara begging her to understand and that they can finally be together. Sara insists that she is not Elizabeth and Gracey begins to have second thoughts but Ramsley insists that it is her and in time she will remember. As Ramsley tells Sara to get ready for her wedding to Gracey, she refuses but Ramsley blackmails her into marrying Gracey in return for her children's safety.

Encouraged by Madame Leota, Jim drives his car through the mansion's conservatory, rescues his children, and stops Sara and Gracey's wedding ceremony where he gives Elizabeth's letter to Gracey, revealing to him the truth about Elizabeth's death and that Ramsley had lied to him about it all those years. Gracey confronts Ramsley, who rages at his master's apparent selfishness for loving Elizabeth, and summons [[Ghost|wraiths]] to kill the group for revenge. However, a [[Elemental|fiery dragon]] emerges from the ballroom fireplace and drags Ramsley down to Hell for eternal [[damnation]]. Sara suddenly collapses, having been poisoned by Ramsley during the wedding, only for the spectral orb encountered by the children to appear and possess Sara, revealed to be Elizabeth's ghost. Elizabeth and Gracey reunite, and Sara is revived. With the curse lifted, Gracey gives the Evers the mansion's [[deed]] and departs to Heaven with Elizabeth, Emma, Ezra, and the other ghosts.

The Evers drive across the [[Seven Mile Bridge]] for a proper vacation, accompanied by Madame Leota, and four [[List of Haunted Mansion characters#Singing Busts|singing busts]] strapped to the back of their car. In a post-credits scene, Madame Leota bids farewell to the audience, inviting them to join the dead using dialogue from the Disneyland attraction.

==Production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The mansion scenes were filmed at [[Movie ranch#Sable Ranch|Sable Ranch]] in [[Santa Clarita, California]]. The main building was constructed over a period of weeks while the cupola and chimneys on the top of the mansion were computer-generated. The rest of film was shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas. The paperboy in the opening scene is the nephew of the director, [[Rob Minkoff]]. A [[Hidden Mickey]] is briefly seen when Ramsley pours the poison in the goblet of wine during the wedding. Upon leaving the mansion via ghost carriage to find the mausoleum, Ezra exclaims "there's always my way," a pivotal line of dialogue from the pre-show from the Disney theme park ride.

The costume and special effects designers wanted the ghost characters to become "more dead" the farther they were from the mansion. While Ezra and Emma look human in the house, their leaving it causes them to become blue and transparent. The zombies in the mausoleum are the "deadest," as they are farthest away.

This was the first film to air on [[Disney Channel]] to contain any profanity besides "hell" or "damn". It also contained the phrase "Big ass termites!", uttered by Murphy.

The design of the mansion is loosely based on Disneyland's version of ''[[The Haunted Mansion]]'' while the iron/glass conservatory was based on Walt Disney World's version of the ride.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the opening scene of the film, Nathaniel Parker had great difficulty trying to carry Elizabeth up the staircase, which is shown on the expressions of his face. This was due to her slippery silk dress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Rick Baker]] did the [[prosthetic makeup]] for the zombies in the mausoleum. He decided to use skull heads for the zombie design.

==Release==
The teaser trailer debuted in October 2002 with ''[[Tuck Everlasting (2002 film)|Tuck Everlasting]]'' and on VHS in February 2003.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
