==Plot==
A group of high school football players gets into an argument with their cheerleader girlfriends over the difficulty of their respective sports. The cheerleaders insist that it is difficult to form a [[human pyramid]], while the players insist that their boot camp is more strenuous. As a result, the players decide to set up a camping weekend with the idea of putting the girls through football training. This turns out to be a bad idea, as one of the cheerleaders ends up beating one of the footballers in a scrimmage game, who then ends up severely beating her. The girls try to escape, only to fall off a cliff and die. Panicked, the players assume that the girls are either dead or dying, and run off in the hopes that nobody will discover what has happened. Unbeknownst to them, one of the girls has survived and later returns at a high-school reunion to seek revenge. She summons the zombified remains of her dead friends, and one by one, picks off the football players.
