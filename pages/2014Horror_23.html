Albert (Jon Wachter) works the night shift as a hot-dog vendor on the [[Lower East Side]], where he meets photographer Ivan (Theodore Bouloukos) after having a confrontation with two drunk patrons. Ivan is fascinated by the slow-witted Albert and decides to give him a job working with him at his studio, where he takes fetish photos. Albert is reluctant to participate in Ivan's photos but shows interest in the photography job and lessons that Ivan offers. When Ivan decides to go to a fashion shoot in Milan, he accidentally leaves the studio's keys with Albert- who uses this as an opportunity to lure unsuspecting women to their deaths by enticing them with promises of a modeling shoot.

It's rare, however, to come across a film as sincerely disturbing, a quality instilled through director and co-writer Andres Torres' casting of Jon Wachter as his anti-hero Albert."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dollar|first1=Steve|title=5 Reasons Why Genre Films Are Better Than Ever|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/5-reasons-why-genre-films-are-better-than-ever-20140813|publisher=IndieWire|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref>
