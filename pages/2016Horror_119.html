The film was released by [[Screen Gems]] on February 5, 2016 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=prideprejudicezombies.htm|title=Box Office Mojo|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=October 9, 2015}}</ref> and by [[Lionsgate]] on February 11 in the United Kingdom.<ref name="P&P&Z UK" /> The film grossed just $16 million worldwide against a budget of $28 million, making it a [[box office bomb]].<ref name=BOM/>

==Plot==
Early 19th century [[England]] is beset by zombies; the Bennet sisters—Elizabeth, Jane, Kitty, Lydia, and Mary—have all been trained in the art of weaponry  and [[martial arts]] in [[China]] at their father's behest so they can defend themselves from the zombies. Mrs. Bennet only wants to see her daughters married off to wealthy suitors. The Bennets attend a country dance also attended by Colonel Darcy and Caroline and Charles Bingley. There, the young and handsome Bingley falls for Jane. Charles Bingley has inherited [[Pound sterling|£]]100,000 (£{{Inflation|UK|0.1|1813|r=1|fmt=c}} million today)—attracting Mrs. Bennet's attention as a desirable suitor for her daughter. When zombies attack the ball, the Bennet sisters fight them off, and Colonel Darcy, a friend of Bingley's and skilled zombie-killer, who was conversely trained in [[Japanese martial arts]] – with property that pays him £10,000 annually  (£{{Inflation|UK|10000|1813|r=-4|fmt=c}} today) – becomes smitten with Elizabeth. On the way to the Bingleys' later, Jane is attacked by a zombie and catches a fever. Darcy orders her confined in fear that she may have been bitten but she recovers.

The Bennets are visited by the overbearing Parson Collins, who proposes to Elizabeth but states that she must give up her life as a warrior, something she refuses to do. Elizabeth meets a charming soldier named Wickham and arranges to meet him at another ball. She travels with him to a church that is filled with zombies who feed on pig brains instead of human brains, keeping their behaviour relatively normal. Wickham believes that with these new civilised zombies, humans can co-exist with them. He asks Elizabeth to elope but she backs off. Elizabeth learns that Darcy convinced the Bingleys to leave to keep Bingley away from Jane. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, having fallen in love with her, she expresses outrage at his actions and fights him.

Darcy later writes Elizabeth a letter to apologize. He reiterates that he separated Jane and Bingley for fear that Jane only wanted to marry Bingley for his wealth – having overheard Mrs. Bennet drunkenly mention it. He also exposes Wickham's true nature, he and Wickham were childhood friends but Wickham may have murdered Darcy's father, squandered his inheritance, then tried to elicit additional money from Darcy's estate; when that failed, Wickham tried to elope with Darcy's little sister, for her fortune. Elizabeth learns that Wickham has taken Lydia and London has been overrun with zombies. Darcy saves Lydia and learns that Wickham is using the 'civilised' zombies to create a zombie army, which has overrun London based on Wickham's planning and will rule the country. He stops him by giving the zombies human brains, which turns them savage.

While fighting, Darcy stabs Wickham's chest, revealing him to have been undead all along, staying civilized by consuming pig brains. Elizabeth saves Darcy from being killed by Wickham. As the two ride across the bridge, the army destroys it to keep the zombies from crossing over from London. Darcy is injured in the explosion and Elizabeth tearfully admits her love for him. After Darcy recovers, he proposes to Elizabeth again and this time, she agrees. The two have a joint wedding with Bingley and Jane. In a [[mid-credits scene]], Wickham leads a horde of zombies toward the wedding celebration with the [[Four horsemen of the Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of the Zombie Apocalypse]] riding behind him.

Christy Lemire of [[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] gave the film one and a half out of four stars, saying "Like the novel ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'', the movie ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies'' is predicated on a simple, single gimmick: It’s ''Pride and Prejudice'' … with zombies. This is a vaguely amusing idea which somehow got stretched out to an entire book, which somehow became a best seller, which inevitably means it had to be made into a film."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pride-and-prejudice-and-zombies-2016|title=Pride and Prejudice and Zombies Movie Review (2016)|date=February 4, 2016|first=Christy|last=Lemire|publisher=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]]}}</ref> Keith Uhlich of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, calling the film "Lumbering, lifeless and—strange thing to say about a cadaver—almost entirely charmless."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/pride-prejudice-zombies-film-review-860009|title='Pride and Prejudice and Zombies': Film Review|date=January 27, 2016|first=Keith|last=Uhlich|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> Lindsey Bahr of the [[Associated Press]] also gave a negative review, saying "This story might have been better suited to a television adaptation.

Literary scholar and Austen professor Devoney Looser stated in ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine her opinion that the film's first half, and especially Matt Smith's Mr. Collins, were comic, jarring, and enjoyable. She assessed the film overall with, "I laughed a lot and I shrieked. I was wavering between B+ and A−. I’m willing to bump it up for its originality and live with my grade-inflation reputation: A−." Zombie expert Clark Collis did not rate the film quite as high: "I enjoy genre movies that attempt something different—and this does—but I didn't find it all that scary. I'd give it a 'B'".<ref>{{Cite news |first1=Clark |last1=Collis |first2=Devoney |last2=Looser |date=February 12, 2016 |title=The Ultimate Fan Face-Off |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/04/pride-prejudice-zombies |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |page=52}}</ref>
