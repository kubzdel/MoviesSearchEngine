==Synopsis==
Five friends have decided to set out on a vacation to the beautiful island of [[Formentera]], where they expect to spend their days full of fun and debauchery. On one of their outings they come across a cave set in a cliff and decided that it would be exciting to investigate it and see what they could find. However it isn't long before the group realizes that they have lost their way, prompting them to try to find the exit instead of exploring further. Unfortunately they are unsuccessful in their attempt and are forced to stay the night and as a result they find their sanity weakening. As the lack of food, water, and sunlight paired with the isolation from society due to a lack of cell phone reception begins to take its toll on the group, they find themselves beginning to panic and hallucinate. Eventually their survival will rely on them making certain decisions that will change them forever.

==Reception==
''[[Fangoria]]'' gave the movie two out of four skulls and stated that at times the pacing was uneven and the film had some overly familiar elements, but stated that the movie was overall "an unsettling portrait of humanity".<ref>{{cite web|last=Macomber|first=Shawn|title=“IN DARKNESS WE FALL” (Miami International Film Festival Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/in-darkness-we-fall-miami-international-film-festival-review/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref> ''[[Twitch Film]]'' also commented on the movie's similarity to other films in the found footage genre, commenting that viewers would likely be able to predict the movie's events but overall felt that the movie's "impressive, strong third act ensures it will have its fans".<ref>{{cite web|last=Vijn|first=Ard|title=Review: IN DARKNESS WE FALL Does Not Stumble|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/02/iffr-2014-review-in-darkness-we-fall.html|publisher=Twitch Film|accessdate=29 April 2014}}</ref>
