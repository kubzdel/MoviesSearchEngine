{{Nihongo|'''''Ashurajō no Hitomi'''''|阿修羅城の瞳||"Eye(s) of [[Asura]] Castle"}} is a 2005 [[Japan]]ese [[horror film]], starring [[Ichikawa Somegorō VII]], [[Rie Miyazawa]] and [[Kanako Higuchi]]. Directed by [[Yōjirō Takita]], it is a movie adaptation of a 1987 [[Kazuki Nakashima]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] set in the 16th century. It has been released on [[DVD-Video]] as ''Ashura'' in [[United Kingdom]] by Yume Pictures in 2006 and in the [[United States]] by [[AnimEigo]] in 2007.

== Story ==
A beautiful ''[[Oni (folklore)|oni]]'' named Bizan (Kanako Higuchi) appears on Earth. She wants to bring demon queen Ashura back to life, so the demons can take over the world beginning in [[Edo]] (modern day [[Tokyo]]). Opposing her is the Oni Makado, an army of demon slayers that was created by the Japanese government. Izumo (Somegorō Ichikawa) once fought with the Makado, but resigned to become a [[kabuki]] actor after he thought he accidentally killed a young girl. After 5 years, Izumo encounters Tsubaki (Rie Miyazawa), who is a member of an all-female acrobatic troupe who rob the citizens of Edo during the night. Falling deeply in love, Izumo notices a red, ugly scar on Tsubaki's shoulder, which is the mark of Ashura. Meanwhile, Jaku, one of Izumo's ex-comrades ([[Atsuro Watabe]]), falls for Bizan, leading the Oni Makado over to the dark side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reel.com/movie.asp?MID=143655&buy=closed&PID=10125928&Tab=reviews&CID=18 |title=Domain Registered at Safenames |website=Reel.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-17}}</ref>

Jaku desires the power of Ashura and captures Tsubaki, but Izumo rescues her. The passion between Izumo and Tsubaki eventually causes the spirit of Ashura to awaken within the latter. After introspection, both Izumo and Tsubaki recall the event they were unable to remember from 5 years ago. This explains why their supposedly chance meetings always invoked a feeling of familiarity.

With great disdain for the transgressions in her human life, Tsubaki leaves for the demon world to fulfill her destiny as their queen. In forlorn pursuit, Izumo arrives at Ashura's inverted sky castle of the demon world and slays Jaku, and then Bizan. Eventually Izumo finds Ashura and fights to the death.
