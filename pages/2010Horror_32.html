Three neophytes ([[Sam Concepcion]], [[AJ Perez]] & [[Robi Domingo]]) are brought to a morgue for the final part of their initiation, while being dressed in lingeries. They are told to last three hours in the keep. An overeager neophyte snoops around the morgue, after  a detached arm on a corpse, with the R.I.P. tattoo on the hand, comes to life.
