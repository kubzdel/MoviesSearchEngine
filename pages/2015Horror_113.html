==Plot==
<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The word count for a plot summary is between 400 and 700 words. -->
Several years before [[Insidious (film)|The Lambert Haunting]], retired [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier reluctantly uses her abilities to contact the spirit of teenager Quinn Brenner's mother, Lillith, who died a year prior.  However, she urges Quinn not to try and contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force.  After auditioning for a school for the performing arts, Quinn sees a mysterious figure waving to her from the distance on the street.  Distracted, she is accidentally hit by a car, having both of her legs broken in the process.  Now stuck in her home with her father Sean and brother Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an [[oxygen mask]] known as the "Man Who Can't Breathe" - the same figure that caused her accident.

Sean later tries to convince Elise, who like him is still grieving after the loss of her husband Jack, to help his daughter, but Elise declines, stating that her previous visits to the dark spiritual world of the "Further" made her realize that an evil spirit is hunting to kill her.  However, she is convinced by her friend and former colleague Carl to continue using her spiritual ability, reminding her about her successful [[Insidious: Chapter 2|case involving Josh Lambert]] in 1986, and stating that she is stronger than any spirits or demons because she is living and they are not.

Due to Elise's refusal, Alex suggests Sean call on alleged demonologists Specs and Tucker, who have built a following on the [[internet]].  During their investigation, Quinn's possession grows increasingly worse as she, now briefly possessed by the demon, breaks through her leg braces and attempts to attack Sean, Specs, and Tucker.  Realizing that Specs and Tucker are scammers, Sean prepares to kick the duo out until Elise arrives.  Deducing that the demon's goal is to lure potential victims to "the Further" so it can eat their life force, Elise decides to enter the spiritual world with Specs and Tucker recording any activities and words she spells out.

With the help of a spirit who likewise is a victim of the "Man Who Can't Breathe," Elise enters the Further and after a brief encounter with the evil spirit that haunts her (a mysterious [[Insidious: Chapter 2|"Bride in Black"]]), she meets with the spirit of Jack, whom she realizes is the "Man Who Can't Breathe" in disguise.  After managing to briefly escape him, Elise returns to the material world and realizes that Quinn has to defeat him on her own. Though Quinn is at first at a disadvantage, Elise reads a message that the Brenners' late neighbor had tried to tell Quinn of: that Lillith left her with a letter to read before she graduated High School, but never found it.  Lillith's spirit then appears and helps Quinn fully take control of her body and defeat the "Man Who Can't Breathe," after which Quinn is finally able to escape the further for good.  Elise leaves after giving parting words to the family, including words of encouragement from Lillith's spirit.

Following the Brenner' successful case, Elise decides to come out of retirement and work with Specs and Tucker.  She arrives home and notices a figure watching her from outside.  Thinking that it is Jack at first, Elise realizes that it is something malevolent before the [[Insidious (film)|Lipstick-Face Demon]] suddenly appears behind her.

Kerry Lengel of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, saying "''Insidious: Chapter 3'' is almost more a spoof of a classic like ''The Exorcist'' than it is an homage. It's not scary horror, it's silly horror, and the audience is in on the joke."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/04/movie-review-insidious-chapter-stars/28496149/ |title=Review: 'Insidious: Chapter 3' is paint-by-numbers scary |work=The Arizona Republic |date=2014-04-25 |accessdate=2015-06-07|last=Lengel|first=Kerry}}</ref> Stephen Whitty of the ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' gave the film two and a half stars, saying "You need more than a few sudden noises and scary shocks to make a good horror movie. But ''Insidious: Chapter Three'' is at least an OK horror movie."<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen |last=Whitty |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2015/06/insidious_chapter_3_review_no_ghoul_like_an_old_gh.html |title='Insidious: Chapter 3' review: No ghoul like an old ghoul |work=Newark Star-Ledger |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave the film two and a half out of four stars, saying "They say the third time's the charm. Not with the ''Insidious'' series, it isn't. Admittedly, installment #3 is an improvement over #2, but it fails to reach the highs of the chilling-but-uneven original."<ref>{{cite web|first=James |last=Berardinelli |url=http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/insidious-chapter-3 |title=Insidious: Chapter 3 |work=Reelviews |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref> Tim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the film four out of five stars, saying "It manages the all-important jump scares with the finesse of a skilled stage illusionist, but it’s the surprisingly sincere emotional core that makes it the pick of the series."<ref>{{cite web|first=Tim |last=Robey |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/insidious-chapter-3/review/ |title=Insidious: Chapter 3 review |work=The Telegraph |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref> Katie Rife of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the film a B-, saying "The motif of grief runs throughout ''Insidious: Chapter 3'', which is surprisingly thematically rich for the third installment of a horror franchise. This emotional undercurrent informs the fright scenes, which otherwise lean rather heavily on jump scares."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rife |first=Katie |url=http://www.avclub.com/review/veteran-character-actress-almost-gets-her-due-insi-220356 |title=Review: A veteran character actress almost gets her due in Insidious: Chapter 3 |work=The A.V.

But given its distinguished forebears, ''Insidious: Chapter 3'' doesn’t quite live up to expectations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/06/movie-review-insidious-chapter-3.html |title=Movie Review: Insidious: Chapter 3 |work=Vulture |date=2015-06-05 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}</ref>

==Sequel==
In an interview Leigh Whannell was asked "If there is a fourth ''Insidious'' film, would that be a sequel to ''Chapter 3'', another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?" Whannell stated: "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there. We've kind of established Lin [Shaye] in this particular film as kind of this superhero, so that would be kind of interesting to explore in the other films."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/leigh-whannell-discusses-ideas-insidious-4/|title=Insidious: Chapter 4 Will Take Place Closer To First Film|author=Isaac Feldberg|work=We Got This Covered}}</ref>
