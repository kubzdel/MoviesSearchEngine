'''''Priest''''' is a 2011 American [[Horror film#Subgenres|action horror]] film directed by [[Scott Charles Stewart|Scott Stewart]] and stars [[Paul Bettany]] as the title character.<ref name="FANGORIA1">{{cite news | url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4236:previewing-priest-exclusive-pics-plus-comments&catid=36:demo-articles&Itemid=56|title=Previewing 'Priest': Exclusive Pics Plus Comments|last=Solis|first=Jorge|work=[[Fangoria (magazine)|FANGORIA]]|date=Apr 22, 2011|accessdate=Oct 12, 2011}}</ref><ref name="PostApocalyptic">{{cite news | last=Marshall | first=Rick | url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2010/08/24/priest-movie-vampires-scott-stewart-paul-bettany/ | title=Why Post-Apocalyptic 'Priest' Won't Be Your Regular Vampire Story | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=August 24, 2010 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w4tQzOhf | archivedate=January 28, 2010 }}</ref> It is loosely based on the [[manhwa|Korean comic]] of the [[Priest (manhwa)|same name]] by [[Hyung Min-woo]]. In an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate world]], humanity and vampires have warred for centuries. After the last Vampire War, a veteran Warrior Priest (Bettany) lives in obscurity with other humans inside one of the Church's walled cities. When the Priest's niece ([[Lily Collins]]) is kidnapped by vampires, the Priest breaks his vows to hunt them down. He is accompanied by the niece's boyfriend Hicks ([[Cam Gigandet]]), who is a wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess ([[Maggie Q]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=15696 | title=Priest | publisher=ComingSoon.net | accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}</ref> 

The film first entered development in 2005, when [[Screen Gems]] bought the [[spec script]] by Cory Goodman. In 2006 Andrew Douglas was attached to direct and [[Gerard Butler]] was attached to star. They were eventually replaced by Stewart and Bettany in 2009 and filming started in Los Angeles, California, later in the year. The film changed release dates numerous times throughout 2010 and 2011. It was especially pushed back from 2010 to 2011 to convert the film from 2D to 3D. It was released in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|May 13}}, 2011. The film earned over $78 million at the box office against a $60 million production budget, but it was panned by critics, who, while noting the film's visual style, criticized the movie's use of genre clichés.

==Plot==
A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planet's surface and led to a [[theocracy]] under an organization called The Church.  They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in [[wikt:reservation|reservation]]s. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.

Priest ([[Paul Bettany]]) is approached by Hicks ([[Cam Gigandet]]), the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priest's girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy ([[Lily Collins]]), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas ([[Christopher Plummer]]) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.

Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a [[pathogen]] that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. Priestess ([[Maggie Q]]) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an [[armored train]] arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.

The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing [[Air pollution|massive clouds of smoke and ash]], have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.

Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she's been infected or not. (Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he'd kill her.)  Hicks doesn't understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her. Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that his brother, Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.

While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest. After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.

Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point. Priest sets off into the sunset.

Since the vampires were intended to move quickly, they were fully computer-generated for the film. While vampires are harmed by sunlight in most lore, the film's vampires are instead photosensitive, being albino cave-dwellers. Stewart said, "They are the enemy we don't really understand, but we fought them for centuries. They are mysterious and alien, with their own culture. You sense that they think and communicate, but you don't really understand what they are saying." The director also called ''Priest'' a homage to ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' with the title character being similar to John Wayne's character and the vampires being similar to the [[Comanche]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Wax | first=Alyse | url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b18018_exclusive_director_scott_stewart_talks.html | title=Exclusive: Director Scott Stewart Talks 'Priest' | publisher=FEARnet | date=January 22, 2010 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5w4tPAUmK | archivedate=January 28, 2011 }}</ref> The animated prologue for the film was created by American animator and director [[Genndy Tartakovsky]].<ref>{{cite news | last=Goellner | first=Caleb | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2598582/genndy-tartakovskys-animated-priest-prologue-now-viewable-on-mobile-phones/ | title=Genndy Tartakovsky’s Animated ‘Priest’ Prologue Now Viewable on Mobile Phones | publisher=[[MTV]] | date=March 7, 2011 | archivedate=March 2, 2016 }}</ref>

==Critical reception==
''Priest'' was largely panned by critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 16% based on reviews from 92 critics and reports a rating average of 3.9 out of 10 with a consensus that "''Priest'' is admittedly sleek and stylish, but those qualities are wasted on a dull, derivative blend of sci-fi, action, and horror clichés".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10009274-priest/ | title=Priest Movie Reviews | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate=May 25, 2011 }}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 41 based on 13 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/priest |title=Priest Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=May 25, 2011 }}</ref> [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade audiences gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}
