== Plot ==

Detective Ulisse Moretti (von Sydow) is investigating a series of murders in [[Turin]] in 1983, known as The Dwarf Murders. The main suspect, a giallo novelist named Vincenzo de Fabritiis, turns up dead and the case is considered closed. However, seventeen years later, a similar series of murders begin and draw the since-retired Moretti back into the case. Moretti teams up with Giacomo (Stefano Dionisi), whose mother was murdered in the 1983 spree, to determine if de Fabritiis is still alive or was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was accused. As the murders continue, the investigating duo discovers that the murderer is arranging their murder to an old [[nursery rhyme]] about the killing of animals.

Don't let your guard down, though, because there are some cruelly well executed set-pieces that are enrobed in a constant sense of dread."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/07/sleepless_2001_review.shtml |title=BBC – Films – review – Sleepless (Non ho Sonno) |last=Haflidason |first=Almar |date=7 February 2012 |work=[[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]] |accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> [[AllRovi|AllMovie]] gave the film a generally negative review, writing, "this feels like an Argento retread – the murder mystery recalls his 1971 ''[[The Cat o' Nine Tails|Cat o' Nine Tails]]'' a little too much, and the overly familiar horrific elements (pace, editing, music, screaming) have little impact."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/sleepless-v242034/review |title=Sleepless – Review – AllMovie |last=McClain |first=Buzz |work=[[AllRovi|AllMovie]] |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref>

== Alternate versions ==

The original US video release from [[Artisan Entertainment]] was heavily edited for content. Every murder sequence in the film was trimmed down for less graphic violence, including the decapitation murder of the ballet dancer which omits the image of the head hitting the floor. In all over a minute worth of footage was cut.

European DVD releases of the film are completely uncut.

The German 2013 [[Blu-ray]] edition is heavily censored, nearly three minutes shorter than the director's cut.
