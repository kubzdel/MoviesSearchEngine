'''''10 Cloverfield Lane''''' is a 2016 American [[psychological thriller]] film directed by [[Dan Trachtenberg]], produced by [[J. J. Abrams]] and Lindsey Weber<!-- Do not remove the producers, please. They are also important. --> and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and [[Damien Chazelle]]. The film stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[John Goodman]], and [[John Gallagher Jr.]] It is the second installment in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' anthological film series]]. The film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar'', but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]], it was turned into a [[spiritual successor]] to the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]''. The film follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable.

The film is presented in a [[third-person narrative]], in contrast to its predecessor's [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage]] style. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in conventional and [[IMAX]] format.<ref name="officialwebsite">{{cite web|url=http://www.10cloverfieldlane.com/|title=Official Website|work=Paramount|accessdate=14 March 2016}}</ref> The film received positive reviews, with many praising the performances of the cast, as well as the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere; it grossed $110 million worldwide.

After breaking up with her boyfriend Ben, Michelle drives away from [[New Orleans]]. While in rural [[Louisiana]], she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before she is sideswiped by a truck and knocked off the road, falling unconscious.

Michelle wakes in a locked room within an underground bunker, her wounds tended to. Howard, the bunker's owner, tells her he brought her there for her protection, claiming that the air outside has been poisoned by nuclear or chemical [[fallout]] from an unknown force. Michelle is initially hostile towards Howard, but once she has calmed down, Howard takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker, and meets Emmett, another survivor who found his way to it. Howard takes her to the viewport of the bunker's exit hatch, showing her two dead pigs outside as evidence of the fallout; Michelle also sees Howard's truck, and recognizes it from the accident. Michelle privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett.

During their first dinner together, Michelle secretly takes Howard's keys and makes her way to the hatch, but as she is about to open it, a woman, Leslie, covered in skin lesions, slams against the window demanding she be let in, then collapses. Michelle openly returns the keys and agrees that Howard was right. Howard admits to accidentally hitting her car in his panic to get to the shelter.

While the trio's relationship becomes more relaxed, Howard still shows intolerance towards Emmett and treats Michelle as a little girl; however, Howard opens up about his daughter who he states is "not with us anymore". Howard enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word "HELP" scratched into its glass and visible to anyone outside. Further suspicious of Howard, Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her to the bunker. They make plans to escape the bunker, creating a makeshift [[Hazmat suit]] behind Howard's back. When Howard discovers tools and parts missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of [[perchloric acid]]. When Emmett takes sole responsibility, Howard coldly kills Emmett with a gun. In shock, Michelle is desperately making final preparations to leave, when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, burning Howard and starting an electrical fire in the bunker.

Michelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howard's homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suit's helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker fire. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in a shed. She then races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a [[Molotov cocktail]] from items in Howard's truck to throw into the ship. The fireball causes the appendage to drop her, and she is able to take the dead woman's car and escape.

As she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to [[Baton Rouge]] to evacuate, but also requesting the help of any able-bodied person in [[Houston]]. At a crossroads, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, a larger alien craft can be seen in the sky.

''10 Cloverfield Lane'' originated from an "ultra low budget" [[spec script]] penned by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, titled ''The Cellar''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logins.specscout.com/homepage.php?mod=screenplay&smod=coverage&cmd=cvgd&sp_id=287|title=The Cellar|work=Spec Scout|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref><ref name="tracking-board.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/the-hit-list-2012-full-list/|title=THE HIT LIST 2012 (FULL LIST)|work=The Tracking Board|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> The Tracking Board included the script in "The Hit List" of 2012<ref name="tracking-board.com"/> – an annually published list of spec scripts written within the year that have impressed its voting members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/the-hit-list/|title=THE HIT LIST|work=The Tracking Board|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> In 2012, [[Paramount Pictures]] bought the script and commenced further development under [[Bad Robot Productions]] for [[Insurge Pictures]], Paramount's specialty label for films with a micro-budget.

In a March 2015 interview, a few months after production wrapped, Winstead was asked about her experience during ''Valencia'' and described it as a "really contained film", reiterating the premise of ''The Cellar'' about a woman being trapped with her mysterious savior in a supposed post-nuclear fallout world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/mary-elizabeth-winstead-faults-interview/|title=Mary Elizabeth Winstead Talks 'Faults' and 'Valencia'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=March 10, 2015|work=Collider|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Later in the month, Insurge Pictures was reported to have been dismantled and its staff absorbed by its parent company.

Bill Zwecker of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' four stars out of four, commending the film as "continually gripping and extremely engrossing ...

In a mixed review for ''[[Slant Magazine|Slant]]'', Chuck Bowen found a lack of character development between the three leads, and labeled the film's ending as anticlimactic.

Abrams commences in selling you the same thing all over again."<ref name="slantreview">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/10-cloverfield-lane|title=10 Cloverfield Lane|author=Bowen, Chuck|publisher=''[[Slant Magazine]]''|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}</ref> Soren Andersen of the ''[[Seattle Times]]'', who gave ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' one and half stars out of four, similarly criticized the film's ending, labeling it as "full-bore" and "Too little.

==Future==
Having originally planned the film as a direct sequel to ''Cloverfield'', Abrams suggested that he has thought of something that if they are lucky enough to get it made "could be really cool that [it] connects some stories" in a third film, even teasing a larger ''Cloverfield'' universe.<ref name="fandango"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/25/cloverfield-jj-abrams-third-movie|title=Cloverfield: J.J.

In October 2016, it was revealed that the Abrams-produced ''God Particle'' would be the third installment in the ''Cloverfield'' franchise.<ref>http://www.slashfilm.com/god-particle-is-cloverfield-3/</ref> After several postponements of the film's release date, it was released as a [[Netflix]] Original on February 4, 2018, under the new title ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]''.

In ''The Cloverfield Paradox'', [[Donal Logue]] cameos as Mark Stambler, a conspiracy theorist discussing the "Cloverfield Paradox"; reviewers observed that the character shares the same surname as Howard Stambler in ''10 Cloverfield Lane''.<ref name="independent easter eggs">{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/cloverfield-3-paradox-easter-eggs-cameos-references-netflix-10-cloverfield-lane-links-secrets-things-a8197506.html | title = The Cloverfield Paradox: All the Easter Eggs, cameos and references to other Cloverfield films | first=  Jack | last=  Shepherd | date = February 7, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[The Independent]] }}</ref> [[Suzanne Cryer]], who appeared as Leslie in ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler.<ref name="independent easter eggs"/>
