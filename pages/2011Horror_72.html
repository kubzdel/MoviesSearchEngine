'''''Haunted Poland''''' ({{lang-pl|Nawiedzona Polska}}) is a 2011 [[horror film]] in the [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] genre, pieced together from amateur footage. The film was produced by ''Maso & Co Productions''. Told cinéma vérité-style, ''Haunted Poland'' depicts the contents of recorded tape filmed by a couple ''Ewelyn'' played by Ewelina Lukaszewska, and ''Pau'' played by [[Pau Masó]] who visited Poland to meet and visit family. However, our duo soon find themselves disturbed by all manner of strange phenomena upon visiting the girl's hometown where she once played with a Ouija board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/46041/ready-visit-haunted-poland |title=Ready to Visit Haunted Poland? |date=July 28, 2011 |publisher=DreadCentral}}</ref> The film  premiered at the AIFF on November 20, 2011.
