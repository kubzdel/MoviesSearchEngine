'''''Resident Evil: Apocalypse''''' is a 2004 [[horror film#Subgenres|action horror film]]<ref name="gross"/> directed by [[Alexander Witt]] and written by [[Paul W. S. Anderson]]. It is the second installment in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|''Resident Evil'' film series]], which is based on the [[video game]] series [[Resident Evil|of the same name]]. The film marks Witt's feature directorial debut; Anderson, the director of the [[Resident Evil (film)|first film]], turned down the job due to other commitments though stayed on as one of its producers. [[Milla Jovovich]] reprises her role as [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]], and is joined by [[Sienna Guillory]] as [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Oded Fehr]] as [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]].

''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' is set directly after the events of the first film, where Alice escaped from an underground facility overrun by [[zombie]]s. She now bands together with other survivors to escape the zombie outbreak which has spread to the nearby Raccoon City. The film borrows elements from several games in the ''Resident Evil'' series, such as the characters Valentine and Oliveira and the villain [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. Filming took place in [[Toronto]], Canada, at locations including [[Toronto City Hall]] and [[Prince Edward Viaduct]].

''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'' received mostly negative reviews from critics who complained about the plot; however, the film garnered praise for its action sequences. It is the lowest-rated of the six films in the ''Resident Evil'' series on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an approval rating of 21%. Earning $129 million worldwide on a $45 million budget, it surpassed the box office gross of the original film. A sequel, ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'', was released in 2007.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->

In [[Resident Evil (film)|the previous film]], former security operative [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] and environmental activist Matt Addison fought to escape an underground genetic research facility called the Hive, the source of a [[zombie]] outbreak. The pair were part of an attempt to expose illegal experiments being performed there by pharmaceutical company [[Umbrella Corporation]]. The film ended as Alice and Addison were taken into custody by Umbrella.

Umbrella sends a team to the Hive to investigate what happened there; the team is overrun by zombies who quickly spread to the nearby Raccoon City. Umbrella responds by quarantining the city and evacuating their personnel from it. Angela Ashford, the daughter of Umbrella researcher Dr. Charles Ashford, goes missing after her security car is involved in a collision. Alice awakens in a deserted hospital and wanders the city in search of supplies, while Umbrella uses the only bridge out of the area to evacuate civilians. At the bridge, disgraced police officer [[Jill Valentine]] meets with her former partner, Sgt. Payton Wells. A zombie bites and infects Wells. In response to the virus reaching the bridge, Major Timothy Cain, leader of the Umbrella forces in Raccoon City, seals the exit and forces the residents to return to the city.

After being abandoned by their employer following a failed attempt to rescue a civilian, Umbrella soldiers [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]] and Nicholai Ginovaef team up with the Raccoon City Police [[List of Resident Evil characters#STARS|Special Tactics And Rescue Squad]] (STARS) to repel zombie attacks. Their position is overrun, and Oliveira is bitten and infected. At a separate location, Valentine, Wells, and news reporter Terri Morales, are about to be overrun, though they are saved by Alice. Umbrella deploys a heavily mutated experimental [[supersoldier]], [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]], who kills the remaining STARS members before searching for Alice. Dr. Ashford hacks into the city's [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system and uses it to contact Alice and the other survivors, offering to arrange their evacuation from the city in exchange for help in locating his daughter. He makes an identical offer to Olivera and Ginovaef, and explains that Umbrella intends to rid Raccoon City of the zombie infection by destroying it using a nuclear bomb.

Alice and the others head to Angela's location, where they are ambushed by Nemesis. Valentine kills Wells after he turns into a zombie. Alice engages Nemesis but is wounded and forced to retreat separately, luring Nemesis away from the rest of the group. Valentine and Morales continue, picking up stranded civilian L.J. en route. Valentine meets Olivera and they find and rescue Angela, although Morales and Ginovaef are both killed. Angela reveals that the zombie outbreak is the result of a virus created by her father to treat the genetic disease from which she suffers: only by regularly injecting herself with the virus is Angela able to survive, though she must also take anti-virus serum to prevent turning into a zombie. Alice uses some of the anti-virus to cure Olivera. Dr. Ashford gives Alice the location of an extraction point where a helicopter awaits. The group makes it to the rendezvous point, but are ambushed by Umbrella forces. Major Cain kills Dr. Ashford and forces Alice to fight Nemesis. Alice gains the upper hand over the supersoldier, though she ceases fighting after realizing that he is Matt Addison, mutated by Umbrella's experiments.

Nemesis turns on Major Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops, but is killed protecting Alice. The rest of the survivors seize the helicopter; they eject Major Cain from it and he is eaten by zombies, including a zombified Dr. Ashford. As the survivors escape, the nuclear bomb detonates over the city, and the resulting blast wave causes the helicopter to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela and is impaled on a metal pole. TV footage attributes the nuclear attack to a meltdown of the city's power plant, covering up Umbrella's involvement. Alice wakes up in an Umbrella research facility and escapes with help from Olivera, Valentine, L.J., and Angela. As they are escaping, Dr. Alexander Isaacs, a high-ranking Umbrella employee, reveals that Alice's escape is part of Umbrella's plan for her.

==Themes==
Media studies scholar Stephen Harper said that both ''Apocalypse'' and the first ''Resident Evil'' film present "highly ambiguous" perspectives on the themes of corporate power, race, gender and sexuality. Describing them both as [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[Postfeminism|postfeminist]] texts, Harper argued that, despite containing some progressive elements including feminist themes that undermine patriarchal power, the films also played into several stereotypes. He said the relationship between Alice and Valentine differs from interactions between male characters in action films as seen by a lack of camaraderie and co-operation between the two and, unlike male characters in ''Apocalypse'', both Valentine and Alice are separately shown being "protective and nurturing" of the young Angela; Harper stated even violent action heroines are often portrayed with such characteristics. Harper also criticized how their revealing clothing and camera angles objectified Alice and Valentine throughout the film, and noted that through the [[African Americans|African-American]] character L.J. ''Apocalypse'' showed an "ironic awareness" of racist stereotypes, though "it stops short of challenging them and, indeed, often deploys them".<ref name=harper/>

[[Douglas Kellner]] from the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]] argued the film's ending played "on fears of out of control nuclear technology and government cover-ups". A news segment shown in the film, which claimed that reports of corporate wrongdoing were false and that people should instead be thanking the Umbrella Corporation, was "a barely disguised allegory of lying by corporations and the state during the [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-[[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] era".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kellner |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Kellner |date=2016 |title=Social apocalypse in contemporary Hollywood film |journal=MATRIZes |volume=10 |issue=1 |page=19}}</ref>

Colors in the film were edited heavily in post-production, giving it a darker look overall while enhancing the brightness of blood and gore. The colors of the Nemesis costume were also tweaked to make it look more lifelike and Alice and Valentine were given modifications such as increasing the glow of their skin and redness of their lips.<ref name=comtwo/>

===Soundtrack===
{{main|Discography of the Resident Evil film series}}

The soundtrack for ''Apocalypse'' was released on August 31, 2004, and contained [[alternative metal]] songs both featured in the film and "inspired" by it. Johnny Loftus of [[AllMusic]] gave the soundtrack three stars out of five, saying it was an "unscrupulous moneymaker" that predictably catered to the film's target audience of teenage boys, adding the "aggression, mania, and generally apocalyptic tone of this material fits well with a movie based on a video game about blowing away crazy zombies".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/resident-evil-apocalypse-original-soundtrack-mw0000158803 |title=Resident Evil: Apocalypse [Original Soundtrack] |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[AllMusic]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20171204142652/https://www.allmusic.com/album/resident-evil-apocalypse-original-soundtrack-mw0000158803 |archivedate=December 4, 2017 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref>
