==Plot==
{{see also|Attack on Titan#Plot|l1=Plot of Attack on Titan}}
<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->

===Part 1===
One hundred years ago, the Titans suddenly appeared and decimated most of humanity. To stop their advance, humanity built a series of walls and lived peacefully there for another 100 years. In the present day village of Monzen, Eren expresses to his friends, Armin and Mikasa, his desire to leave the confines of the Outer Wall and see the outside world. After their failed attempt to approach the wall, Souda, the captain of the Garrison, explains to them that the military is assembling a scouting regiment to explore beyond the walls. However, the wall is suddenly attacked by the Colossal Titan. The wall is breached and Titans enter the village, eating people and getting back up despite being injured. When Mikasa tries to rescue a baby, she is separated from Eren, and is presumed killed.

Two years later, Eren and Armin enter the Scout Regiment, along with Sasha, Jean, and others. The team, led by Military Police Commander: Kubal, move out into one of the towns of the Outer Wall. The group is then attacked by Titans but are saved by Captain Shikishima and Mikasa, who survived the attack from two years ago and is now part of the Scouts. Eren eventually confronts Mikasa and she reveals to him that the experience made her realize the world is cruel. After realizing that Mikasa and Shikishima are most likely together, Eren is once again devastated.

When more Titans surprise them, Kubal retreats, leaving the Scouts to fend for themselves. Lil, who had just lost her lover, sacrifices herself. Jean attempts to convince Eren to flee, but Eren chooses to fight back before losing his leg in the process. Eren manages to save Armin from being eaten but at the cost of his own life. Though crushed by Eren's death, Mikasa keeps fighting until she runs low on fuel and comes face to face with the same Titan that ate Eren. However, a Titan emerges from within it and begins battling the other Titans. Souda and Mikasa realize that the Titan is Eren. After he starts to collapse, Mikasa frees Eren from his Titan shell.

===Part 2===
Years before, a young Eren is forcibly injected with an experimental serum by his father, but soon after Eren's mother discovers this, a military police squad break in and kill Eren's parents. Eren survives with the help of Souda. In the present, Eren is captured by Kubal and his squadron, believing he is a threat to humanity. Armin tries to convince Kubal of Eren's innocence but is ignored. Before Eren is executed, another intelligent Titan appears, seemingly killing Kubal and his squadron before fleeing with Eren. Eren awakens in a mysterious bunker with Shikishima, who reveals the origins of the Titans as a military experiment gone wrong that soon developed into a virus that decimated humanity  and his plans to launch a coup against the corrupted government. Eren agrees to help.

Eren, Shikishima, and his troops reunite with Mikasa and the others. Shikishima attempts to recruit them into his coup, but when the true sinister purpose behind his plan is revealed, Eren backs out. The remaining regiment neutralize Shikishima's troops and Shikishima reveals himself to be the Titan that took Eren earlier. Eren transforms into his Titan form and battles the Shikishima Titan, with Eren emerging victorious in the end. Titan Eren proceeds to climb the wall and plants a bomb to create a massive blockage to prevent more Titans from entering.

Having survived the earlier attack, Kubal attempts to stop the group but is shot by Sasha, forcing him to transform into the Colossal Titan. As Eren, Jean, and Mikasa battle the Colossal Titan, Shikishima reappears in his Titan form and sacrifices himself by lodging the bomb into the Colossal Titan's mouth, killing them both. The detonation successfully closes the hole in the wall and Eren and Mikasa stand at the top of the wall overlooking the ocean.

In a [[post-credits scene]], footage of the battle with the Colossal Titan is analyzed, in Shikishima's bunker, by an off-screen character, who says that Eren and Mikasa's unpredictability is what makes them "fascinating".

===Critical reception===
Lee Edmund of ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', said that the film was "One of the most perversely original fantasy movies in recent memory, this adaptation of a Japanese manga series is a schizophrenic mix of genres."<ref name="www.scmp.com">{{cite news|first=Edmund |last=Lee |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/48-hours/article/1847546/film-review-live-action-attack-titan-supersized-zombie-flick |title=Film review: live-action Attack on Titan — a supersized zombie flick |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=2014-05-22 |accessdate=2015-09-18}}</ref> Hope Chapman of [[Anime News Network]] also praised the movie. "Outstanding and immersive aesthetic unlike any other horror movie, swiftly paced and gripping start to finish, sharp script with heavy thematic undertones, holds up completely as its own work of art divorced from the source material."<ref>{{cite web|last=Chapman|first=Jacob Hope|title=Attack on Titan: Part I (Live-Action Movie) - Review|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/attack-on-titan/part-i/live-action-movie/.90469|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=August 11, 2015|date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> Brian Ashcraft of ''Kotaku'' said "The First Attack on Titan Movie Stinks".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=The First Attack on Titan Movie Stinks|url=http://kotaku.com/the-first-attack-on-titan-movie-stinks-1721708870|website=Kotaku|accessdate=August 5, 2015|date=August 3, 2015}}</ref> Piera Chen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "a visually refreshing blockbuster undermined by clichés."<ref name="hollywood_reporter" /> Derek Elley of ''[[Film Business Asia]]'' gave it a 7 out of 10 rating and called it "a trash-horror fantasy that's a big-budget B picture."<ref name="fba-review" />

SFX artist Yoshihiro Nishimura and director Shinji Higuchi responded to some critics, with Nishimura responding to unfavourable comparisons of the film's special effects with Hollywood's standards thus: "I'm sorry, but deciding what movies to see based on their budget, and comparing everything to Hollywood, that's like how some people feel secure buying Okame natto when they go to the supermarket". Higuchi referenced one critic of the film's characters, saying "who's the idiot who gave this guy an early release of the film?!"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hawkes|first1=Rebecca|title='You should watch movies that have been hit in the face with stacks of cash': Attack on Titan filmmakers blast critics|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/attack-on-titan/bad-reviews-critics-reaction/|website=Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=August 5, 2015|date=August 3, 2015}}</ref>

===Subtitle controversy===
''Attack on Titan: Part 1'' received criticism from San Francisco, Ohio, Kentucky, and Wisconsin theater attendees due to a subtitle ("I've been waiting for this day!") freezing in the first ten minutes of the film and continued to stay frozen for a majority of the film due to a software problem. As a consequence, Funimation announced that they would [[hardsub]] Part 2 and all future releases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-attack-on-titan-subtitle-disaster-1733962390|title=The Attack on Titan Subtitle Disaster|last=Ashcraft|first=Brian|work=Kotaku|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref> However, others have reported the subtitles working properly in other states. Funimation has reported that fewer than 2% of theaters have been affected by the freeze.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-10-01/fans-report-english-subtitle-issues-for-attack-on-titan-live-action-film/.93612|title=Fans Report English Subtitle Issues for Attack on Titan Live-Action Film|last=Anime News Network|first=|work=Anime News Network|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref>

==Potential remake==
''[[Deadline.com]]'' reported that [[Warner Bros.]] is in negotiations to secure the film rights to the ''Attack on Titan'' franchise. ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' producer [[David Heyman]] would be on board to produce a proposed two-film project that would remake the 2015 Japanese live-action film adaptations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-17/deadline-warner-bros-in-negotiations-for-western-attack-on-titan-films/.111171 |title=Deadline: Warner Bros.
