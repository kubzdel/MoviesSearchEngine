==Reception==
''[[Bleacher Report]]'' gave the film a positive review stating "It isn't trying to be smart or groundbreaking, just a lot of big, silly, violent fun." but noted that the movie would appeal most to wrestling fans, as  some of the plot's elements and humor are confusing, as they require that the viewer has prior knowledge of the wrestlers' history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Warrell|first=Richard|title=Movie Review: 'Pro Wrestlers vs. Zombies' with Kurt Angle, Roddy Piper and More|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1966191-movie-review-pro-wrestlers-vs-zombies-starring-kurt-angle-roddy-piper-more|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Though ''[[Fangoria]]'' panned the film overall, as they felt that "Instead of capitalizing on the concept and going full-force, ''PRO WRESTLERS VS. ZOMBIES'' stretches its novelty to the breaking point by sitting on a repetitive story structure."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanley|first=Ken W|title=“Pro Wrestlers vs. Zombies” (Film Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/pro-wrestlers-vs-zombies-film-review/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>
