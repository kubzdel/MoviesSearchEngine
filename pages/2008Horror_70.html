'''''The Eye''''' is a 2008 American [[supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by David Moreau and Xavier Palud, scripted by [[Sebastian Gutierrez]], and starring [[Jessica Alba]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Alessandro Nivola]], and [[Rade Šerbedžija]]. It is a [[remake]] of the [[Pang Brothers]]' 2002 [[The Eye (2002 film)|film of the same name]].

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FilmPlot, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
Sydney Wells is a successful classical [[violin]]ist from [[Los Angeles]] who has been blind since she was five years old, caused by an accident with firecrackers. Fifteen years later, after celebrating conductor and pianist Simon McCullough's birthday during rehearsal, Sydney undergoes a [[Cornea transplantation|cornea transplant]], which causes her eyesight to return, a bit blurry at first. As time goes on, Sydney's vision begins to clear; however, she also begins experiencing terrifying visions, mostly of fire and of people dying. She also sees people that are already dead, on one occasion when a girl passes right through her. Sydney attempts to unravel the mystery of the visions, and also to convince others, primarily her visual therapist and fellow violinist, Paul Faulkner, who helps her in her quest. She knows that she is not going insane.

Accompanied by Paul, Sydney travels to [[Mexico]], where the [[cornea]] donor Ana Cristina Martinez was originally from. She discovers from Ana's mother that the images of fire and death are the result of an industrial accident that Ana foretold. Ana hanged herself because she was unable to stop the accident. Sydney forgives Ana's spirit, who leaves in peace. As Sydney and Paul begin their journey home, they are caught in a traffic congestion caused by a police chase on the other side of the border. Sydney sees the little girl from her vision in the car next to her. She then realizes that this is what her vision has been all along, to save the people that are about to die from an accident.

Still able to see the death silhouettes, Sydney begins to get everyone off the highway, starting with a bus filled with people. She and Paul convince everyone to leave the bus and the cars by telling them that there is a bomb inside the bus. However, a driver leading the police chase rushes through the border barriers and collides into a [[tank truck]], igniting leaking gasoline in the process. Sydney sees the little girl trapped in the car, her mother laying on the ground in front of it, already being hit by a passenger and losing consciousness. Paul breaks open the window and gets the girl out. Paul and Sydney carry the girl and her mother to safety just before the tank truck causes a chain explosion. Sydney is blinded by flying glass fragments in the process.

After recovering at a hospital, she returns to Los Angeles to continue performing as a blind violinist, though with a more optimistic view of her condition.

==Cast==
*[[Jessica Alba]] as Sydney Wells
*[[Parker Posey]] as Helen Wells
*[[Alessandro Nivola]] as Paul Faulkner
*[[Rade Šerbedžija]] as Simon McCullough
*[[Obba Babatundé]] as Dr. Hawkins
*[[Tamlyn Tomita]] as Miss Cheung

==Themes==
Using the pretext of a [[psychological thriller]] and paranormal experiences, the film explores mental illnesses such as the [[monothematic delusion]] known as [[mirrored-self misidentification]].

Other themes include the concept of [[precognition]], or premonition, perhaps becoming a popular cultural crossover from Asian beliefs about the unknown.

==Production==
Remake rights to the [[Pang brothers]]' original 2002 Hong Kong film, ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'', were purchased by [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]].

The band [[Blaqk Audio]] provided instrumental versions of the songs, "Between Breaths" and "The Love Letter" that were used in trailers and on the official website for the 2008 film. In response to the buzz it created, [[Jade Puget]] of the electronic duo suggested a possible public release of all the CexCells songs in instrumental form.

Alba spent much time with the blind [[soprano]] [[Jessica Bachicha]] to learn about how blind people lived, used the [[white cane]], read [[Braille]], etc.

This American remake follows ''[[Naina (2005 film)|Naina]]'', a Hindi movie released in 2005, that is also based on the Pang Brothers' film.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Filming===
The filming was done primarily in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], and the surrounding areas. Sets were created using much of the downtown metro area, Sydney's apartment was built on a sound stage and was also filmed in Albuquerque. Exteriors were shot to look like the [[Downtown Los Angeles]] area. The establishing hospital shots – wherein Sydney is supposed to have had her sight-restoring surgery – are of [[Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center|LAC/USC Medical Center]] in the [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles|Boyle Heights]] district; 3/4 shots looking north- and southeast of the main 18-floor-high central building (the same building used for the television soap-opera ''[[General Hospital]]''). Fictionally, the burned-out Chinese restaurant is supposed to be located just three-blocks from where Sydney lives; the exterior scene, in which Sydney is about to get into a taxicab and travel to Mexico, was filmed on 7th Street, just east of [[Figueroa Street|Figueroa]], in the downtown area. Shots of Dr. Faulkner's office building are of the Forestry building at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC). Several other scenes, including outdoor shots, were shot in Albuquerque.<ref>Wendy R. Williams (2008-01-29).
