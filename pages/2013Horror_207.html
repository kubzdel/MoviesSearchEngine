Scott Miller (Shameer Seepersand) is one of the lone survivors of an apocalyptic world where the undead have overtaken the earth.

Scott's only other human interaction has come via radio communications with a couple hidden away elsewhere, but they're eventually overtaken by zombies, leaving him truly alone. Things seem to be looking up when Beth returns, however when they meet two more uninfected people their problems become even more complex.

== Reception ==
HorrorNews.net initially disliked the film upon their first viewing, but upon seeing it a second time they felt that it was "definitely not an exciting, action-packed, zombie flick. It is a slow burn of a film that explores the end-of-the-world questions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/102292/film-review-wasteland-2013/|title=Film Review: Wasteland (2013)|date=2015-10-08|website=Horrornews.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-12}}</ref> [[Ain't It Cool News]] gave the film a positive review and also commented upon the film's nature, writing "If you’re looking for an action packed zombie romp, this ain’t it. But ''WASTELAND'' has a lot of soul and is quite gripping in the tragic and lonely tale it tells."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/73029#7|title=AICN HORROR looks at GOODNIGHT MOMMY!
