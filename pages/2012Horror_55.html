'''''Come Out and Play''''' is a 2012 Mexican [[horror film]] produced, shot, edited, written, and directed by Makinov. The film stars [[Vinessa Shaw]] and [[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]]. Beth (Vinessa Shaw) and Francis (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a young married couple, are on holiday together when they venture to a beautiful, but highly remote, island. Beth is pregnant and the two are hoping to enjoy their last vacation before their baby is born. When they arrive, they notice that while there are plenty of children present, the adults all seem to be missing. Initially attributing this to the after effects of a recent festival, they quickly realize something far more sinister is afoot. The two will face terror and unsettling difficult decisions in their quest to make it off the island alive.

It is a remake of "[[Who Can Kill a Child?]]" (aka Island Of The Damned), a 1976 Spanish horror movie.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|title=Trailer for Who Can Kill a Child? remake, Come Out and Play!|url=http://iconsoffright.com/2013/02/13/who-can-kill-a-child-remake-come-out-and-play-reveals-trailer/|website=Icons of Fright|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=February 13, 2013}}</ref>
