'''''The Death of Poe''''' is a 2006 [[independent film]] that tells the tragic story of the mysterious disappearance and death of the [[United States|American]] author [[Edgar Allan Poe]].  The film is shot mostly in [[black-and-white]] with occasional color sequences.

==Plot==
After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a [[hallucination]] where he is [[premature burial|buried alive]].  He prepares to take a trip to [[New York City]] via a ferry steamboat from [[Richmond, Virginia]], to [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine ''[[The Stylus]]''.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding. 

Poe is depicted as having some type of [[memory loss]], which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local [[tavern]] rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at [[West Point]].  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised $1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his [[Prospectus (book)|prospectus]] for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the $1,000 he had collected.

An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a [[cooping]] ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the [[scam]] die amidst the brutality of their captors.

Afterwards, Poe is released and he eventually collapses in the street and is found by a local tavern owner.  The man calls for Poe's uncle Henry Herring and Dr. Joseph Snodgrass.  The men discuss what to do with the incoherent, half-conscious Poe.  Snodgrass assumes he is drunk and suggests they let him sleep it off - a theory the film seems to dispute by showing him early in the film declining offered [[alcohol]] several times.  Herring becomes more concerned and demands Poe be taken to Washington College Hospital, despite the expense.

At the hospital, Dr. John Moran tends to Poe, unable to accurately determine his situation or the cause of his failing health, or how he received his injuries.  He muses to his wife, Mrs. Moran, that he does not want to be known as the physician who killed Edgar Allan Poe.  Over the next three days, the bedridden Poe is kept in seclusion in a private room as Moran denies Poe visitors, including his Baltimore cousin Nielson Poe, who becomes convinced that his cousin is about to die.  Poe ultimately does die after one final hallucination or perhaps a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] where he sees his dead wife [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]].

British film journalist M.J.
