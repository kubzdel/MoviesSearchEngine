'''''Freak Out''''' is a 2004 [[Parody film|parody]] [[Z movie]].

==Plot==
When die-hard horror movie fan Merv Doody ([[James Heathcote]]) finds a dangerous escaped mental patient at his doorstep, he has a panic attack but regains his cool when he realizes the potential in the hapless killer. Merv invites best pal Onkey (Dan Palmer) over and the two soon set about executing a makeover on the maniac to create the ultimate slasher movie villain. Outfitted with a snazzy orange jumpsuit, an appropriately menacing hockey mask, and armed with a spatula, Merv and Onkey's murderous creation soon sets out on a violent rampage that sends the small-town citizens of Redwater Cove running for their lives. Upon realizing that they are the only ones who can put an end to the bloody killing spree, the longtime horror fans prepare to put their vast knowledge of slasher disposal to the ultimate test.
