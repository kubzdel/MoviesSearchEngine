==Plot==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
The film follows three groups of people, all of whom have found a video camera on their doorstep and begin filming under the impression that this is the key to winning money from a mysterious competition. Tom ([[Todd Stashwick]]) is an average guy filming the life of his family with his wife Emmy. Beth ([[Alexandra Lydon]]) is a bored and isolated college girl who sees the camera as something to fill her free time. Leonard (Barak Hardley) is a [[mother's boy]] who believes his clown makeup will steal the scene. Each group has been given a label - "The Family" (Tom & Emmy), "The Woman" (Beth), and "The Clown" (Leonard), but they are largely unaware of what is truly going on and are shocked when they receive instructions telling them to keep filming or die.
