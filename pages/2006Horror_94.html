'''''The Hills Have Eyes''''' is a 2006 American [[horror film]] and remake of [[Wes Craven]]'s 1977 [[The Hills Have Eyes (1977 film)|film of the same name]]. It was written by filmmaking partners [[Alexandre Aja]] and [[Grégory Levasseur]] of the French horror film ''[[Haute Tension]]'', and directed by Aja. The film follows a family that is targeted by a group of cannibalistic mutants after their car breaks down in the desert.

The film was released theatrically in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] on March 10, 2006. It earned $15.5 million in its opening weekend in the U.S., where it was originally rated [[NC-17]] for strong gruesome violence, but was later edited down to an R-rating. An unrated DVD version was released on June 20, 2006. A sequel, ''[[The Hills Have Eyes 2]]'', was released in theaters March 23, 2007.

==Plot==
In the New Mexico desert, a group of scientists are killed by a [[mutant]] named [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Pluto|Pluto]] ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]). Later, Bob Carter ([[Ted Levine]]) and his wife, Ethel ([[Kathleen Quinlan]]) are traveling from [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to [[San Diego, California]] for their silver anniversary. With them are their teenage children Bobby ([[Dan Byrd]]) and Brenda ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), eldest daughter Lynn ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), Lynn's husband Doug Bukowski ([[Aaron Stanford]]), Lynn and Doug's baby Catherine (Maisie Camilleri Preziosi), and their [[German Shepherd]]s, Beauty and Beast.

In the [[New Mexico]] desert, they meet a [[gas station]] attendant named Jeb ([[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]]), who tells them of a short-cut through the hills. After taking the supposed short-cut, their tires are punctured by a hidden spike strip. Doug and Bob go look for help, while the rest of the family stays behind.

Later that day Bobby chases a panicked Beauty into the hills and finds her mutilated body. Frightened, he runs and falls, knocking himself unconscious. A young female mutant named [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Ruby|Ruby]] (Laura Ortiz) finds him and protects him from her brother [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Goggle|Goggle]] ([[Ezra Buzzington]]).

As Doug travels towards the interstate, he finds a vast area full of craters that are filled with numerous abandoned cars and other items.

Bob goes back to the gas station for help, and after finding news clippings detailing various disappearances that have occurred in the area, he realizes the attendant purposefully led them to danger by suggesting they take an alternative route through the hills. When Bob exits he finds the hysterical Jeb, who commits suicide in front of him. In fear, Bob attempts to flee, but is attacked by the mutant leader, [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Papa Jupiter|Papa Jupiter]] ([[Billy Drago]]), and dragged into the mining caves by Jupiter, Jupiter's eldest son [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Lizard|Lizard]] ([[Robert Joy]]), and Pluto.

Bobby returns to the trailer, but doesn't mention Beauty's death not wanting to frighten the rest of the family. Later that night, the family is awakened by Bob's screams, and they all rush from the trailer, except for Brenda and the baby, who are left behind. Outside they find Bob being burned alive on a stake and frantically try to save him, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Pluto and Lizard use the distraction to ransack the trailer, and Lizard beats and [[rapes]] Brenda. When Lynn returns to the trailer she is greeted by Lizard and Pluto, and forced to let Lizard drink from her breasts while her baby is held at gunpoint. When Ethel returns she is shot by Lizard, and Lynn stabs Lizard in the leg, prompting him to shoot Lynn in the head. Lizard and Pluto flee with the baby after Lizard attempts to shoot Brenda with an unloaded gun.

Doug and Bobby return to the trailer and discover Lynn and Ethel, who die shortly afterward. Goggle, who is watching the Carters with a pair of binoculars, is attacked by Beast, who tears his throat out, killing him. The next morning, Doug and Beast set out to rescue Catherine. During his search, Doug comes across an abandoned [[nuclear testing]] village, and is knocked unconscious by [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Big Mama|Big Mama]] (Ivana Turchetto). Upon awakening, he escapes an ice box filled with human body parts and continues his search, only to encounter [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Big Brain|Big Brain]] ([[Desmond Askew]]). After Big Brain tells him the mutants' origins, Doug is attacked by Pluto, who beats him and severs two of his fingers with an axe. Pluto almost kills Doug, but Doug manages to gain the upper hand while Pluto is distracted, and kills him with his own axe.

Outside, Doug kills the mutant [[List of Mutants in The Hills Have Eyes#Cyst|Cyst]] ([[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]]) and continues to search for Catherine. After ordering Lizard to kill Catherine, Big Brain is mauled to death by Beast. Lizard takes a [[cleaver]] and prepares to kill Catherine, but finds that Ruby has replaced the baby with a piglet and taken her. Doug sees Ruby running through the hills with Catherine and follows her. At the trailer, Brenda and Bobby discover their mothers body missing and track it to find Papa Jupiter eating her, so they lure him towards the trailer and prepare an explosive trap, which destroys the trailer, apparently killing Papa Jupiter.

Doug catches up with Ruby, but before she can return Catherine, Lizard attacks him. Lizard and Doug have fight and Lizard is presumed dead. Ruby gives Doug his daughter back. Lizard, who is still alive aims a shotgun at Doug. In order to save Doug, Ruby tackles Lizard off a cliff, sending them falling to their deaths. Bobby and Brenda find that Papa Jupiter managed to survive their trap, and Brenda finishes him off. They are then reunited with an exhausted and bloody Doug, Catherine, and Beast. As the survivors of the Carter family embrace, an unknown mutant watches them through binoculars from the hills.

==Production==
[[Wes Craven]], director and writer of the original film, considered a remake after he saw the success of other horror remakes such as ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' and ''[[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|The Amityville Horror]]''. The search then began for filmmakers to helm the project. Marianne Maddalena, Craven's long time producing partner, came across [[Alexandre Aja]] and his art director/collaborator Grégory Levasseur who had previously made the French slasher film ''[[Haute Tension]]''. After showing the film to Craven and the rest of the production crew, they were impressed with the pair. Craven comments that they "demonstrated a multi-faceted understanding of what is
profoundly terrifying" and "After viewing the film and then meeting the film makers, I knew
I wanted to work with them."<ref name="Production">{{cite web| title= The Hills Have Eyes Production PDF| publisher= 20th Century Fox| url= http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3346/notes.pdf| accessdate= 2007-08-22| format= PDF| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210129/http://media.movieweb.com/galleries/3346/notes.pdf| archivedate= 2007-09-30| df= }}</ref> Aja and Levasseur then began to re-write the story in what is the pair's first American production.

Director Aja and art director Grégory Levasseur chose not to film in the original's filming location of [[Victorville, California]], and instead scouted many locations for filming including [[Namibia]], [[South Africa]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Mexico]]. The two settled on [[Ouarzazate]] in [[Morocco]], which was also known as "the gateway to the Sahara Desert".<ref name="Production"/>

The film is set in [[New Mexico]], and strongly implies that a large number of atmospheric nuclear weapon tests were performed in that state. In fact, the only atmospheric nuclear detonation in New Mexico was the [[Trinity test]], the first test of a nuclear device conducted on July 16, 1945. The United States carried out most of its atmospheric nuclear weapons tests at the [[Nevada Test Site]] and in the [[Marshall Islands]] at the lagoons of [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]] and [[Eniwetok]], between 1946 and 1962. The theatrical poster shows Vinessa Shaw's character lying down with a mutant hand on her face.

===Effects===
Prior to filming, Aja and Levasseur had already conceived an idea for the mutants' appearance. "We based all our descriptions and directions on real documents, pictures and footage that we found on the effects of nuclear fallout in [[Chernobyl]] and [[Hiroshima]]", explains Aja. ''The Hills Have Eyes'' utilized the K.N.B. EFX Group Inc. who had done previous work on films such as ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (for which they were nominated for an [[Academy Award]]) and ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]''.

K.N.B. spent over six months designing the mutants, first using 3D designer tools, such as [[ZBrush]], allowing them to use a computer to generate their sculptures. After prosthetics were made, they could be fitted to the actors before filming. Robert Joy, who plays the mutant Lizard, explained, "Every day, these amazing artists took more than three hours to transform me into something that could only be found in a nightmare."<ref name="Production"/>

K.N.B. artist [[Greg Nicotero|Gregory Nicotero]] was also made a cameo as Cyst, the mutant with the halo head-gear.

Jamison Goei and his team, who had done previous work on ''[[Hellraiser: Hellseeker]]'' and ''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'', had done over 130 visual effects for the film. A large part of that was digitally constructing the testing village, which in actuality was only one built street with others digitally added. The team also warped the mutant's faces slightly, which is shown mostly in the character of Ruby.

Papa Jupiter displays no deformities. However, as shown in "The Making Of", Papa Jupiter appears to have a large [[parasitic twin]] attached to his upper left torso. The young children of the film had their deformities added by CGI, with the exception of Ruby, who had a combination of CGI and makeup.

===Casting===
The casting process began with the selection of ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''{{'}}s [[Ted Levine]] as the character Big Bob. Levine was also a fan of the film ''Haute Tension''. Afterward, [[Kathleen Quinlan]] was cast as Ethel in her first role starring in a horror film (despite appearing in ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'' and ''[[Event Horizon (film)|Event Horizon]]''). Next, [[Aaron Stanford]] was cast as Doug Bukowski who "undergoes the most radical transformation of anyone in the Carter family"<ref name="Production"/> Stanford even asked not to see any of the mutants in make-up before his character's battle in the testing village so, that way, he'd be truly frightened. When casting Lynn, Doug's wife, Aja wanted to cast [[Vinessa Shaw]] who he had wanted to work with since seeing her in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1999 film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''. Shaw was hesitant to play the role, but after watching ''[[Haute Tension]]'', she agreed, explaining: "There was such an odd combination of beauty and terror, it felt almost like an art film. So, after meeting with Alex and Greg, I decided to do it."<ref name="Production"/> For the role of Brenda, the filmmakers sought a young actress who had relatively little exposure and found it in [[Emilie de Ravin]] who was beginning her rise in the television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. After de Ravin, [[Dan Byrd]] was cast as Bobby. Byrd had previous genre experience starring in ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 TV miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]''.

Aja then had the six actors arrive in the filming location of [[Morocco]] early to bond together.

When casting for the mutants, associate producer Cody Zwieg explained: "We needed to find actors who could not only perform the stunt work, handle the extensive makeup and perform in that makeup, but who truly could embody the fierce, primal nature of the mutants' way of life."<ref name="Production"/> To play the role of Pluto, Aja looked to [[Michael Bailey Smith]], who had been in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''. For Lizard, the filmmakers cast [[Robert Joy]], who had made previous genre films such as ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' and [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Land of the Dead]]''. Ezra Buzzington, impressed with the filmmakers, agreed to play the role of Goggle and even watched a documentary about human cultures engaging in [[cannibalism]]. To play the mutant leader, Billy Drago was cast. Drago had previously had a role in [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[The Untouchables (1987 film)|The Untouchables]]'' and other horror features. The most difficult mutant to cast was Ruby, who was a "touch of sweetness to the madness of the mutants."<ref name="Production"/> Laura Ortiz was ultimately cast, making her film debut.
