==Synopsis==
A near-death experience in a lake leaves Madison (Michelle Mylett) with extreme hydrophobia. It's grown so bad that she's unable to attend her best friend Hannah's (Caroline Korycki) wedding because of the rain, as Madison believes that a sinister figure known as the Drownsman (Ry Barrett) will pull her into his world and kill her. In their attempt to help her, Madison's friends try to hold a seance to make contact with this being and find that Madison is being haunted by Sebastian Donner (also played by Barrett), a serial killer that loved to listen to his victims' hearts beat as they slowly died. However the group soon finds that their attempts to help Madison has caused the Drownsman to notice them as well and he begins to pick them off one by one.

==Reception==
''Nerdly'' gave ''The Drownsman'' three out of five stars, writing "As an homage to the works of [[John Carpenter|Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven|Craven]] et al. it works. As a origin story for a new franchise villain it works. As a movie? Well if you’re willing to ignore the odd flaw even in the films own internal logic like I did, then ''The Drownsman'' works. If not…"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wheat|first1=Phil|title=Frightfest 2014: ‘The Drownsman’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2014/08/23/frightfest-2014-the-drownsman-review/|publisher=Nerdly|accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[Twitch Film]]'' gave a mixed review, commenting that the film "made a valiant effort to bring itself around with strong visuals and a decent villain kill.
