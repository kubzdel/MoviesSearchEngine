'''''Cherry Falls''''' is a 2000 American [[slasher film]]<ref>{{cite book|title=TLA Film, Video, and DVD Guide 2002-2003: The Discerning Film Lover's Guide|author=Bleiler, David|date=2004|page=107|isbn=978-0312282097|publisher=St. Martins Griffin}}</ref> directed by [[Geoffrey Wright]], and starring [[Brittany Murphy]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Michael Biehn]]. The plot focuses on a small [[Virginia]] town where a serial killer is targeting teenaged [[virgin]]s. After being submitted to and rejected by the [[MPAA]] numerous times, the film was never picked up for theatrical distribution and was purchased by [[USA Films]], who telecast it for the first time on July 29, 2000.

==Plot==
In the woods outside of Cherry Falls, [[Virginia]], a teenage couple, Rod Harper ([[Jesse Bradford]]) and Stacy Twelfmann ([[Bre Blair]]) are getting romantic in a car when a black-haired female appears and murders them both. Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken ([[Brittany Murphy]]), the daughter of the local sheriff, is with her boyfriend, Kenny ([[Gabriel Mann]]), who thinks it is time to go "see other people." Jody goes back home to find her father, Brent ([[Michael Biehn]]), upset that she is out past her curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the [[murders]] the next day. They see that the killer carved the word "virgin" into both victims. At school, Brent sees English teacher Mr. Leonard Marliston ([[Jay Mohr]]), who urges him to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets.

Annette Duwald, also a virgin, is killed in the same fashion of the last night's events. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. No students are invited, but Jody and her friend Timmy, who stayed after school, witness the meeting. Timmy asks to borrow Jody's [[cell phone]], and goes into the stairwell to make a call. Jody goes downstairs to find him, and discovers his dead body in a locker room. She is confronted by the killer who attacks her, but she manages to escape. At the police station, Jody describes the killer to an officer, who draws a composite. Brent confides with an old friend, Tom Sisler, (the current high school principal) that the suspect looks like "Lora Lee Sherman."  The two are both visibly nervous, and Jody listens in on their conversation.

Later at school, Jody and Kenny reconcile, and later Jody learns from her mother about the tale of Lora Lee. Twenty-five years ago, Lora Lee was a high school loner. She claimed that four popular boys at school, including Brent and the high school principal, raped her one night. Her cries fell on deaf ears and she left the city for the rural outskirts, where she was rarely seen or heard from again. After Jody discovers the truth, disappointed with the hypocrisy of her parents, she visits Kenny at his house. They talk, and Jody being upset with her parents, tries to pressure sex on Kenny. He refuses, pushing her away.

After catching news of the killer's targeting of virgins, the high school students in town congregate at an abandoned [[hunting lodge]] to indulge in a mass [[orgy]]. Brent goes to the school to meet Sisler only to find the principal dead in his office with the words "virgin not" carved into his forehead. Before Brent can react he is knocked out by the killer. Jody, who has refused to attend the orgy with Kenny, is out riding her bike when she cycles by Mr. Marliston's house and witnesses him dragging a heavy trunk inside. Suspicious, Jody sneaks into the house and opens the trunk. She recoils as she finds the beaten and bloody body of her unconscious father inside, before she too is knocked unconscious. At the orgy, Kenny is about to have sex with a girl when he has second thoughts and leaves to find Jody. He drives around trying to find her but is puzzled to see her bicycle outside of Marliston's house.

Downstairs in his house, Marliston puts on a wig and makeup to "become" Lora Lee Sherman. Marliston reveals that he is Lora Lee Sherman's illegitimate son, and asks Brent to retell the story of what happened that night 25 years ago. Brent reveals that the four boys, including himself, did indeed rape Lora Lee. Marliston says his mother became an abusive "psycho" after the rape and that one of the rapists is his father; there is an implication that Brent is in fact Marliston's biological father. By frightening virgins, Marliston anticipated a large high school orgy, which would thereby rob all the wealthy parents of their precious children's [[virginity]].

Kenny enters the house and frees Jody as Brent fights with Marliston, who manages to brutally kill him. Jody and Kenny flee to the orgy with Marliston in furious pursuit, killing a deputy en route. He bursts inside wielding an axe and mass panic erupts. After wildly stabbing panicking students and then trying to escape, Marliston fights both Jody and Kenny, with Kenny being severely wounded during the melee. Eventually, Marliston is pushed off a balcony by Jody and impaled on fence posts. At first he seems to be dead, before reviving briefly only to be promptly shot dead by Deputy Sheriff Mina, who unloads two pistols into him, ending his killing spree. The next day, Jody explains everything to the police about what happened around town and last night. And she and her mother head away from the police station. As they leave town, Jody sees someone resembling Lora Lee Sherman disappear behind a moving school bus. The film ends with a shot of the waterfalls outside town, turning red.

==Production==
In October 1998, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced [[Geoffrey Wright]] as director. Wright promised an intelligent script full of irony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/wright-to-helm-rogue-s-slasher-thriller-cherry-1117481694/|title=Wright to helm Rogue's slasher thriller 'Cherry'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref> In 1999, the filmmakers began scouting locations in [[Virginia]], using the town square in [[Warrenton, Virginia|Virginia]]; the high school used in the film was [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Richmond, Virginia)|Thomas Jefferson High School]], located in [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name="lose">{{cite DVD notes

The film's set was described as "tense" by writer Ken Selden, due to the thirty-day production schedule falling behind, which led to budget issues from October Films.<ref name="lose"/> Director Geoffrey Wright kept Selden's original script relatively unchanged, but re-wrote the film's final "orgy scene," which had originally been conceived by Selden as featuring the teenagers having a mass sex party under a giant white sheet.<ref name="lose"/> Wright opted to shoot the scene with the cast nude, which resulted in much of the scene being cut in order to avoid an X rating.<ref name="lose"/>

==Release==
''Cherry Falls'' was shopped at the [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] film market in 1999, and was sold for theatrical distribution in all international territories across the world.<ref name="lose"/>

However, the film was troubled by censor disapproval in the United States, and the distributors' relationship with [[USA Films]] led the company to make the decision to release it as a [[television movie]] in the United States, syndicated on the [[USA Network]].<ref name="lose"/> As a result, it became the most expensive television film ever made, with a production budget of $14 million.<ref name="lose"/> ''Cherry Falls'' was released in the United States on October 20, 2000.<ref name="var-rev" />

The film did, however, have successful theatrical runs in the United Kingdom and throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/dec/21/brittany-murphy-films-box-office|title=Brittany Murphy's career in movies: every film – and what it made at the American box office|last=Stoddard|first=Katy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 21, 2009|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2000/tv/news/inside-move-cherry-heads-for-usa-nets-1117786354/|title=Inside Move: 'Cherry' heads for USA Nets|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Harris|first=Dana|date=September 13, 2000|accessdate=January 14, 2014}}</ref>
