'''''Sint''''' (released on DVD as '''''Saint''''' in Europe and '''''Saint Nick''''' in the United States) is a [[2010 in film|2010]] [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Black comedy|dark comedy]] [[horror film]] about [[Sinterklaas]], the character on which the Anglo-Saxon [[Santa Claus]] is based. The film was directed by [[Dick Maas]] and marked his return to the horror genre, in which he gained acclaim with his debut ''[[De Lift]]'' (1983) and ''[[Amsterdamned]]'' (1988). The story distorts the popular traditions of Sinterklaas and portrays him as a ghost who murders large numbers of people when his annual celebration night coincides with a full moon.

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=March 2017}}
On 5 December 1492, a gang led by former bishop Niklas is killed by villagers who refuse to put up with the gang's looting and killing any longer. In years in which the gang's death date coincides with a full moon, they return as murderous ghosts.

The public is unaware of this and annually celebrates the [[Sinterklaas]] tradition on 5 December, with adults not believing that Sinterklaas exists but making little children believe that he is benevolent. The [[Zwarte Piet]]en are not blackened by soot from chimneys but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' [[crosier]] (bishopsâ€™ staff) has sharp edges and is a weapon. On 5 December Sinterklaas and the Zwarte Pieten do not stand out, as many people are dressed like them for the celebration.

The last time the ghostly gang returned was in 1968. Hundreds of people were killed, including the whole family of a little boy, Goert, who is now a police detective. The authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret.

Since there is a full moon on 5 December 2010, Goert is very concerned and recommends forbidding all Sinterklaas activities and increasing surveillance, but he is not taken seriously and sent on leave. As Goert predicts, the gang returns and kills hundreds of people. While the gang is immune to bullets, they are finally chased away by fire.

The film met with mixed reviews with an aggregate score of 50% from 10 reviews (with an average rating of 5.3/10) on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref name=RottenTomatoes>{{cite web|title=''SAINT'' (2011)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sint/|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>

==Controversy==
While children are not permitted to see the film, parental concern arose over the film's poster, seen in the streets and in the lobbies of movie theaters. It shows Sinterklaas with a mutilated face and a malevolent look. Some people were concerned that this could be confusing and frightening for little children that still believe in Sinterklaas. A legal complaint was filed in October 2010, requesting the removal of all posters. In the subsequent court case, director Dick Maas argued that if parents could make their children believe that Sinterklaas existed they could also inform their children that the man on the poster was not the real Sinterklaas. The court ruled in favor of Maas, noting that the mutilated face was not visible enough on the poster, and rejected the complaint.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sint film poster worries classification body|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/10/sint_film_poster_worries_class.php|publisher=Dutchnews.nl|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beslissingen Reclame Code Commissie over de reclame-uitingen voor de film SINT|url=http://www.reclamecode.nl/consument/default.asp?nieuwsID=401|accessdate=14 November 2010|language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=College van Beroep bevestigt uitspraak: Poster voor de film Sint niet in strijd met Reclamecode|url=http://www.reclamecode.nl/consument/default.asp?nieuwsID=403|accessdate=14 November 2010|language=nl}}</ref>
