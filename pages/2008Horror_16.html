==Plot==
Five friends go to [[New Orleans]] [[Mardi Gras]]. On their way home, they get into a car accident and realize they have hit a man. Before anyone can call for help, an [[ambulance]] arrives. They are taken to a strange hospital where their injuries can be examined.
Upon arrival, the five friends begin disappearing one by one.

The plot centers on Mercy Hospital where inhumane experiments are being done on the living patients by an insane staff. The "experiments" are brutal, often killing the victim. In one set piece, the internal organs of a patient are hung like a garland over the autopsy table. The experiments are designed to save the head doctor's wife, who has a terminal disease.

I have no problem calling it a weekend rental for the horror fans who've seen it all."<ref>{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=FEARNET Movie Review - Autopsy|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-autopsy|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> ''[[Dread Central]]'' and ''HorrorNews.net'' both gave mostly positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web|last=VanCroft|first=Angel|title=Film Review: Autopsy (2008)|url=http://horrornews.net/15791/film-review-autopsy-2008/|publisher=HN.n|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and ''Dread Central'' stated that although the film "does have its fair share of pitfalls" it was overall "a living, breathing nightmare of a movie that's as sadistic as it is surreal."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Autopsy (2009)|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/autopsy-2009#axzz30cVa1Mkn|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> In contrast, ''[[DVD Talk]]'' gave a more mixed review, writing that "Director Adam Gierasch shows some talent with a few sick set pieces and bursts of aggression, but some comatose performances, predictable jumps and a slightly aimless final third keep this in stable condition."<ref>{{cite web|last=McGaughy|first=Cameron|title=Autopsy (review)|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/37116/autopsy/|publisher=DVD Talk|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
