==Plot==
In [[Salem, Massachusetts]], Heidi ([[Sheri Moon Zombie]]), a recovering drug addict, works as a [[DJ]] at a hard rock station with her co-workers Whitey ([[Jeff Daniel Phillips]]) and Herman ([[Ken Foree]]). She receives a strange wooden box containing an album by a band named The Lords. At her home, a downtown apartment house, she and Whitey listen to the record, which is a series of string and woodwind instruments playing several notes, then repeating itself. Heidi has a vision of women who worship [[Satan]], at an unspecified time in the past, ritually birthing a baby then damning the child. The vision stops once Whitey turns the record off.

The next day, Heidi interviews Francis Matthias ([[Bruce Davison]]), who has written a book about the [[Salem witch trials]]. The station then plays the Lords' record, which causes all of the women in Salem (other than Heidi) to enter a trance. After the show is over, Matthias tells his wife ([[María Conchita Alonso]]) that the band's name, The Lords, bothers him. That night, Heidi's landlord, Lacy ([[Judy Geeson]]), insists that Heidi split a bottle of wine with her and her sisters, Sonny ([[Dee Wallace]]) and Megan ([[Patricia Quinn]]). Megan, a palm reader, tells Heidi that she is fated to succumb to her dark sexual desires: "the only reason you exist". Disturbed, Heidi leaves the party. Later, Heidi notices her dog is acting strangely. She enters the supposedly vacant Apartment 5 and experiences visions of a demon and a nude witch that demands that she "bleed us a king". Heidi wakes up in bed and assumes the events in Apartment 5 were a vivid nightmare.

Troubled, Heidi visits a church and falls asleep, dreaming that she is sexually assaulted by the priest present. Heidi flees the church but is faced with a ghostly entity who tells her that he has been waiting for her. Meanwhile, Matthias researches the Lords. He discovers some music in a book and, after asking his wife to play the notes on their piano, confirms that it is the same music heard on the record. Matthias tracks down the author, who tells him that in the seventeenth century one Reverend Hawthorne ([[Andrew Prine]]) accused a coven of Satan worshippers of creating the music to control the women of Salem. As a result, Hawthorne had the women executed, but not before their leader, Margaret Morgan ([[Meg Foster]]), put a curse on both the Salem women and Hawthorne's descendants, calling his bloodline "the vessel by which the devil's child would inherit the earth". Further research demonstrates that Heidi is a descendant of Reverend Hawthorne.

Heidi's radio station announces they will be giving away tickets to the upcoming Lords of Salem concert (though this concert never eventuates on-screen). The record is played once again, which causes Heidi to have more strange visions that disturb her. Upset, she spends the night at Whitey's home, but experiences more disturbing visions before waking up in her own apartment. Heidi begins using drugs again. While she is under the influence of drugs, Lacy, Sonny, and Megan take Heidi to Apartment 5. Inside, there appears to be a huge opera house with a demon seated on a throne at the top of a staircase. She approaches him as he screams and embraces her with tentacle-like appendages, but later she finds her way back to her bedroom.

The next day, Matthias tries to tell Heidi the truth about the Lords and her lineage. Instead, Lacy and her sisters kill him. Heidi hears his murder taking place, but does nothing. Later at the concert, Heidi joins Lacy, Sonny, Megan, and the ghosts of Margaret and her coven in a satanic ritual. The Lords' music causes the female audience members to strip off their clothing. In the midst of surreal visions, Heidi blissfully gives birth to [[Antichrist|a strange creature]] which looks akin to a crawfish, atop the corpses of the naked audience members. The next day, Heidi's station reports on a mass suicide at a rock concert, as well as the disappearance of Heidi.

==Production==
''The Lords of Salem'' is the third film from [[Blumhouse Productions|Haunted Movies]], the first two being ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' and ''[[The Bay (film)|The Bay]]''. After directing the [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and its [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]], Rob Zombie stated that he wanted to try something different and original. Also factoring into Zombie's decision was that he was offered complete creative freedom for the project, something that he did not have for either of his ''Halloween'' pictures.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Mike|title=Rob Zombie Bewitched by ‘Lords of Salem|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/09/rob-zombie-bewitched-by-lords-of-salem|publisher=Deadline}}</ref> Zombie had the idea for the movie before starting on the second ''Halloween'' movie; however, as he puts it, "it wasn't really like I was working on it. I was like, 'Oh, this would kind of be a cool idea. Like, Salem radio station, blah blah blah, music', and then [I] forgot I even wrote that down."<ref name=ZombieOne>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Nigel M.|date=12 September 2012|title=Rob Zombie on Going for Broke With 'Lords of Salem' and Why Making a Third 'Halloween' Would Be "Masochistic"|work=Indiewire|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/rob-zombie-interview-lords-of-salem-halloween#|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}</ref> After [[Jason Blum]] came to Zombie asking for something "supernatural in nature", Zombie was reminded of the Salem idea.<ref name=ZombieOne/> Despite this, Zombie stated that much of the original concept changed significantly, noting that once the project got underway that he "basically started writing it from scratch" <ref name=Complex>{{cite web|last1=Barone|first1=Matt|title=Interview: Rob Zombie Talks "The Lords of Salem" and Why He Doesn't Care If You Like It|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2013/04/rob-zombie-lords-of-salem-interview|website=Complex|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>

Filming was done quickly, at a rate faster than Zombie was used to for his movies and as a result much of the script was changed to adjust to the abbreviated schedule.<ref name=EmpiremeetsZombie>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Owen|title=Exclusive: Empire Meets Rob Zombie|url=http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1659|website=Empire|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Between the film wrapping and editing Zombie embarked on a tour with  his band, which he stated "was a great idea on paper, but in execution it's been insanity."<ref name=EmpiremeetsZombie/> The trailer debuted at Zombie's concert on May 11, 2012, at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Barton|first=Steve|title=Rob Zombie Bewitched by ‘Lords of Salem’|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55547/take-shaky-peek-trailer-rob-zombies-lords-salem/|publisher=Dread Central}}</ref> In an interview, Zombie said that the film would be his cinematically biggest film and described it as "if [[Ken Russell]] directed ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''".<ref>{{youtube|B2cv_UGnV98|ROB ZOMBIE GOES BIG WITH THE LORDS OF SALEM}}</ref> ''Lords'' became the last film of veteran actor [[Richard Lynch (actor)|Richard Lynch]], who died in 2012 – though, due to Lynch's worsening health and being close to blindness, Rob Zombie could not film his scenes properly and was forced to re-shoot the scenes with Andrew Prine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Rob Zombie talks The Lords of Salem|url=http://dailydead.com/interview-rob-zombie-talks-the-lords-of-salem/|work=Daily Dead|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}</ref> Later, actor [[Michael Berryman]] provided further insight in the problems on set: the opening sequence involved 4 pages of scenes that called for Berryman, Lynch, Haig and Prine (in another role). However, Lynch did not remember his lines, and he was called to read a declaration of judgement out loud, but as Lynch had trouble seeing, that did not work either so the actors were sent home. Rob Zombie was not given another shooting day on location and the situation was further complicated with Lynch's death. Not given the funds to film the sequence, much of it was dropped.<ref>{{YouTube|QZlv_5TplL8}}</ref>

Of the book, Zombie has also commented that it "offers a different experience from the film since it can obviously go into much more detail" and that the book is based on the original screenplay for ''Lords of Salem'', which differs significantly from the final script used in the film.<ref name="FangQA"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Release date for The Lords of Salem and movie tie-in book announce (PRE-Order book)|url=http://robzombie.com/2012/12/release-date-for-the-lords-of-salem-film-and-book|publisher=Rob Zombie|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
In October 2012 Zombie stated that he had hired guitarist [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]] to create the movie's score.
