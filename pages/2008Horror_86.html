'''''The Happening''''' is a 2008 [[psychological thriller]] film<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-happening-v391120|work=Allmovie|accessdate=November 10, 2012|title=The Happening|author=Buchanan, Jason}}</ref> written, co-produced and directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]] and starring [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Zooey Deschanel]], [[John Leguizamo]] and [[Betty Buckley]]. The film follows a man, his wife, his best friend and his friend's daughter as they try to escape from an inexplicable natural disaster.

The film was advertised as being Shyamalan's first R-rated film; it held its premiere in New York City on June 10, 2008, and was later released on June 13, 2008 in the United States. It received mostly negative reviews from critics,<ref name="meta">{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/happening | title=Happening, The (2008): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc | accessdate=2008-10-07 }}</ref> but grossed $163 million worldwide against its $48 million production budget.

==Plot==
In [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]], people begin committing [[mass suicide]]. Initially believed to be caused by a bio-terrorist attack using an airborne [[neurotoxin]], the behavior quickly spreads across the [[northeastern United States]]. Elliot Moore, a high school science teacher in [[Philadelphia]], hears about the attacks and decides to go to [[Harrisburg]] by train with his wife, Alma. They are accompanied by his friend Julian and Julian's eight-year-old daughter Jess. Julian's wife is stuck in Philadelphia but is expected to meet them in Harrisburg. The train loses all radio contact en route and stops at a small town. They receive word that Philadelphia has been attacked by the toxin and Julian's wife was not able to get on the train to Harrisburg, instead taking a bus to Princeton. Julian decides to go look for her, leaving his daughter with the Moores while he hitches a ride. However, when they get to Princeton, it has already been hit by the toxin. Succumbing to it, the driver runs the car into a tree and Julian commits suicide.

Elliot, Alma and Jess hitch a ride with a [[Plant nursery|nurseryman]] and his wife. The nurseryman believes that plants are responsible, as they can release chemicals to defend themselves from threats. The group are joined by other survivors and split into two groups, with Elliot, Alma and Jess in the smaller group. When the larger group is affected by the toxin, Elliot realizes that the plants are targeting only large groups of people. He splits their group into smaller pockets and they walk along, arriving at a [[model home]]. Two other groups arrive on the property, triggering a neurotoxin attack, signaled by what appears to be wind blowing through the vegetation. The next house they come upon is sealed, its residents trying to protect themselves from the toxin. Elliot's attempts to reason with them are deemed unsuccessful when the residents shoot Josh and Jared, two teenage boys whom Elliot had earlier befriended.

Elliot, Alma and Jess next come upon the isolated house of Mrs. Jones, a negative, elderly eccentric who has no outside contact with society and is unaware of the current disaster. The following morning, Mrs. Jones becomes infected with the toxin. Realizing that the plants are now targeting individuals, Elliot locks himself in the basement but is separated from Alma and Jess, who are in the home's springhouse out back. They are able to communicate through an old talking tube, and Elliot warns them of the threat. He expresses his love for her before deciding that if he is to die, he would prefer to spend his remaining time with her. The three leave the safety of their buildings and embrace in the yard, surprised to find themselves unaffected by the neurotoxin. The outbreak has abated as quickly as it began.

Three months later, Elliot and Alma have adjusted to their new life with Jess as their adopted daughter. On television, an expert, comparing the event to a [[red tide]], warns that the epidemic may have only been a warning. He states that humans have become a threat to the planet and that is why the plants have responded aggressively. Alma discovers she is pregnant and embraces Elliot with the news.

In the [[Tuileries Gardens]] at the [[Louvre Palace]] in [[Paris, France]], a scream is heard and everyone freezes in place as the wind rustles through the trees, signifying another attack by the plants.

==Production==
In January 2007, [[M. Night Shyamalan]] submitted a [[spec script]] entitled ''The Green Effect'' to various studios, but none expressed interest enough to purchase it. Shyamalan collected ideas and notes from meetings, returning home to Philadelphia to "rewrite" it, and finally [[20th Century Fox]] greenlit the project.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117958169.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Shyamalan re-working 'Green' | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] | accessdate=2007-03-22 | date=2007-01-28}}</ref> Now titled ''The Happening'', the film was produced by Shyamalan and [[Barry Mendel]] and was the former's first R-rated project.<ref name="lands">{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960659.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Fox lands Shyamalan movie | work=Variety | publisher=Reed Business Information | date=2007-03-06 | accessdate=2007-03-22}}</ref>

On March 15, 2007, Shyamalan described the film as "a paranoia movie from the 1960s on the lines of ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' and ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]''".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSSP1831220070315|title=Shyamalan to find form with new apocalyptic thriller|accessdate=2009-08-20|publisher=Reuters | date=2007-03-15}}</ref> An India-based company, [[UTV Motion Pictures|UTV]], co-financed 50% of the film's budget and distributed it in India, while Fox took care of other territories.

===Casting===
Later in March, Wahlberg, with whom Shyamalan had been negotiating at the same time as his deal with Fox, was cast into the lead role of the US$57 million project. Shyamalan had previously cast Wahlberg's brother [[Donnie Wahlberg|Donnie]] in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]''.

===Filming===
Production began in August 2007 in Philadelphia, with filming on [[Walnut Street (Philadelphia)|Walnut Street]], in [[Rittenhouse Square Park]], in [[Masterman High School]], on South Smedley Street,<ref name="wahlberg">{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117962103.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | author=Michael Fleming | title=Wahlberg to star in 'Happening' | work=Variety | publisher=Reed Business Information | date=2007-03-29 | accessdate=2007-03-29}}</ref> and at the 'G' Lodge in Phoenixville.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.phoenixvillenews.com/article/PV/20070822/tmp01/308229991|title=Shyamalan filming at 'G' Lodge|access-date=2017-04-30|language=en}}</ref> The release date was June 13, 2008, intentionally set for [[Friday the 13th]] to suit the thriller also filmed in Michigan.<ref name="wahlberg" />

===Critical reception===
<!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. -->
[[Rotten Tomatoes]], a [[review aggregator]], reports that 18% of 173 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4/10. The consensus reads, "''The Happening'' begins with promise, but unfortunately descends into an incoherent and unconvincing trifle."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10007985-happening/ | title=The Happening Movie Reviews | work=Rotten Tomatoes | publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc | accessdate=2016-04-16 }}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film scored a 34 out of 100 based on 38 reviews.<ref name="meta"/>

On June 8, 2008, days before the first few reviews for the film came online, Shyamalan told the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'': "We're making an excellent [[B movie]], that's our goal".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/06/08/2008-06-08_shyamalan_back_on_terror_firma.html#ixzz0OlGyryDS| title=Shyamalan back on terror firma| accessdate=2009-08-20 |publisher=Daily News (New York) | first=Ethan |last=Sacks| date=2008-06-07}}</ref> Some critics enjoyed it because of this. Glenn Whipp said, "Tamping down the self-seriousness in favor of some horrific silliness, M. Night Shyamalan's ''The Happening'' plays as a genuinely enjoyable B-movie for anyone inclined (or able) to see it that way".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/shyamalan-movie-film-2066068-review-wahlberg|title=Shyamalan 'The Happening' offers horrific silliness, B-movie style |accessdate=2008-12-24 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]}}</ref>

Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said the film lacked "cinematic intrigue and nail-biting tension" and that "the central menace [...] does not pan out as any kind of Friday night entertainment".<ref name=HR-review>Kirk Honeycutt, "[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/happening-125207 Film Review: The Happening]", ''The Hollywood Reporter'', June 10, 2008, accessed Jun 13, 2008.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''’s Justin Chang felt that it "covers territory already over-tilled by countless disaster epics and zombie movies, offering little in the way of suspense, visceral kicks or narrative vitality to warrant the retread".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117937379.html?categoryid=31&cs=1| title= The Happenin | author= Justin Chang| publisher= Variety| date= 2008-06-10| accessdate= 2008-06-14}}</ref> [[Mick LaSalle]] wrote in his ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' review that he considered the film entertaining but not scary. He commented, too, on Shyamalan's writing, opining that, "instead of letting his idea breathe and develop and see where it might go, he jumps all over it and prematurely shapes it into a story".<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/12/DDS5117GQK.DTL&type=movies| title= Movie review: Urban flight in 'The Happening'| author= Mick LaSalle| publisher= ''San Francisco Chronicle''| date= 2008-06-13| accessdate= 2008-06-14}}</ref> [[James Berardinelli]] said the film had neither "a sense of atmosphere" nor "strong character development"; he called its environmental message "way-too-obvious and strident," gave it a star and a half out of a possible four, and concluded his review by saying, "''The Happening'' is a movie to walk out of, sleep through, or—best of all—not to bother with."<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=1040| title= The Happening: A movie review by James Berardinelli| author= James Berardinelli| publisher= ''ReelViews''| date= 2008-06-13| accessdate= 2014-12-04}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''’s [[Richard Corliss]] saw the film as a "dispiriting indication that writer-director M.

[[Stephen King]] liked the film, stating: "Of Fox's two summer creepshows [the other being ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe]]''], give the edge to ''The Happening'', partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear, partly because this time he's completely let himself go (hence the R rating), and partly because after ''[[Lady in the Water]]'' he had something to prove".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20210538,00.html | title= Horror Movies: Why Big Studio Releases Are Rare to Scare | author= Stephen King | publisher= ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | date= 2008-07-11 | accessdate= 2008-01-03}}</ref> Critic [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', awarding the movie three stars, found it "oddly touching": "It is no doubt too thoughtful for the summer action season, but I appreciate the quietly realistic way Shyamalan finds to tell a story about the possible death of man".<ref>{{cite news | url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/REVIEWS/545929629 | title= The Happening | author= Roger Ebert | publisher= ''Chicago Sun-Times'' | date= 2008-06-12 |accessdate= 2008-06-14}}</ref> William Arnold of the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' called it "something different—and a pleasant surprise" among that summer's major Hollywood releases, and approved of its taking "the less-is-best approach."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/The-Happening-relies-on-suspense-not-special-1276382.php| title= 'The Happening' relies on suspense, not special effects| author= William Arnold| publisher= ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer''| date= 2008-06-12| accessdate= 2014-12-04}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]''’ [[Manohla Dargis]] praised Wahlberg's lead performance, adding that the film "turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense".<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/movies/13happ.html?_r=0 | title= Something Lethal Lurks in the Rustling Trees| author= Manohla Dargis| publisher=''New York Times''| date= 2008-06-13 |accessdate= 2014-01-02}}</ref> Philipa Hawker of ''[[The Age]]'' gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting on "the mood of the film: a tantalizing, sometimes frustrating parable about the menaces that human beings might face from unexpected quarters," drawing special attention to "the sound of the breeze and the sight of it ruffling the trees or blowing across the grass&nbsp;— an image of tension that calls to mind [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film-reviews/the-happening/2008/06/12/1212863797111.html |title=Philippa Hawker, The Age |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-09-20}}</ref> [[Richard Roeper]] of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' said, "It almost dares you to roll your eyes or laugh at certain scenes that are supposed to be deadly serious.

''The Happening'' has also attracted academic attention. Joseph J. Foy, professor of politics and popular culture, describes Shyamalan's film as an expression of "post-environmentalism" in which traditional paradigmatic politics are replaced with a call for the world to "embrace a revolutionary reevaluation of wealth and prosperity not in terms of monetary net worth or material possessions, but in terms of overall well-being".<ref>{{cite book | author= Joseph J.

The film was nominated for four [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s: [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor|Worst Actor]] for Mark Wahlberg (also for ''[[Max Payne (film)|Max Payne]]''), and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay|Worst Screenplay]] for M.

Wahlberg offered his own opinion of ''The Happening'' in 2010, saying that [[Amy Adams]], who was in consideration for the role of Alma Moore, had "dodged the bullet" by not starring in the film. He said, "It was a really bad movie... Fuck it. It is what it is... You can’t blame me for not wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasn’t playing a cop or a crook."<ref>{{cite web |title= Mark Wahlberg admits 'The Happening' was terrible. What?
