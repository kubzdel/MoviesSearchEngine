==Plot==
Fed up with Brad's ([[Frank Roberts (actor)|Frank Roberts]]) on-screen antagonist's foul-ups, his director, Hilary Jacobs ([[Kylie Minogue]]), publicly humiliates him and fires him on the spot in front of onlookers. Her further degrading of him (as he comes hoping for one more chance) in her office causes this actor to go [[Berserker|berserk]], [[Self-harm|mutilating himself]] before cutting out her tongue using the modified prop shears as his real-life signature weapon. Before he could harm anyone else, his co-star Vanessa Turnbill ([[Molly Ringwald]]) gives him a makeshift [[tracheotomy]] which ends in Brad being seemingly [[electric shock|electrocuted]] as [[Public address|P.A.]] man Lossman ([[Geoff Revell]]) looks on. But as Brad dies it seems he curses the source of his misery: ''Hot Blooded'' and all who would work on it. Now in present-day Australia, Lossman is a teacher using his personal experiences as warnings to his students that any attempts to complete filming or even screening of ''Hot Blooded!'' has ended up with lives being lost in mysterious and disturbing ways (like a producer being suspiciously electrocuted in an editing room or a director mysteriously discovered with his throat slit). But some of his pupils decide such a chance is too much of a temptation and despite his better wishes they decide to try to finish the film as a graduation grade. They contact Vanessa Turnbill to co-star; she is persuaded by her agent to go back to Australia; when she arrives at the airport she is greeted by Raffy and Hester who take her to a press conference to give the film publicity; while being interviewed a local reporter asks Vanessa if she is worried about the curse on the film, she passes off the question with a joke saying that "Oh if I die, I get paid extra".

As the crew makes the movie, the Scarman kills several of them. He is eventually defeated when the work print is burnt in a fire.

During the finished film's premiere. The Scarman comes out of the print.
