=== Reviews ===
Todd Brown, writing for ''[[Twitch Film]]'', notes that this film, like the director's previous hit ''[[D@bbe|Dabbe]]'', "once again draws on Islamic mythology and demons as its inspiration," but that, "he had a better budget to work with this time and the cinematography is a good bit better while also indulging Turkey's traditional campy edge".<ref name="twitch01">{{cite web |title=D@bbe Director Returns With Semum! |first=Todd |last=Brown |coauthors= |url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2007/12/dbbe-director-returns-with-semum.php |work=twitch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18 }}</ref> "Cinematography and design work is dead solid and I do believe I detect notes of both ''[[Death Note]]'' and ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' in the demon and hell effects," he adds.<ref name="twitch02">{{cite web |title=Full Theatrical Trailer For Turkish Horror Semum! |first=Todd |last=Brown |coauthors= |url=http://twitchfilm.net/news/2008/01/full-theatrical-trailer-for-turkish-horror-semum.php |work=twitch |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18 }}</ref>
