==Plot==
{{more plot|date=April 2017}}
The film stars [[Aden Young]] as Bob Longmore, a man struggling with a mysterious disease which is causing his body to slowly become invisible. Having abandoned his family eight years earlier when the condition began emerging, he lives in a logging town in the far north of [[British Columbia]], isolating himself as much as possible and keeping his body carefully covered whenever he does have to interact with people. 

When his ex-wife Darlene ([[Camille Sullivan]]) calls him to discuss their troubled teenage daughter Eva ([[Julia Sarah Stone]]), he resolves to return to the city, but is forced to deliver a supply of drugs for Crisby ([[Ben Cotton]]) in exchange for the repair of his vehicle; the visit becomes further complicated when Eva disappears soon after his return, forcing him to juggle the drug delivery with trying to find his daughter.<ref name=thr>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/unseen-fantasia-review-912417 "'The Unseen': Fantasia Review"].

==Critical reaction==
{{expand section|date=April 2017}}
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film critic Dennis Harvey wrote that the film "is ultimately middling as a quasi-sci-fi/horror suspense drama, but it has authentic grit as a story about one man’s struggle with alcoholism and depression."<ref name=variety/> Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', John DeFore found the drug smuggling subplot unnecessary, but gave the film a favourable review overall and interpreted the invisibility plot as "a metaphor for a working class increasingly left out of society's decision-making processes".<ref name=thr/>
