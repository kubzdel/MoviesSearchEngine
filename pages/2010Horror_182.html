==Reception==
[[Twitch Film]] gave the film a generally favorable review while noting that "others will simply see this as another boring Asian ghost flick and it's difficult to contradict them. Even though the film is visually attractive, boasts a solid soundtrack and some decent acting, it's really not all that different from its peers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2010/06/fetus-horror-in-womb-ghosts-review.php|title=Fetus Horror in Womb Ghosts: Review|author=Matthijs, Niels|accessdate=7 December 2010|date=22 June 2010}}</ref> Film Business Asia gave a rating of four out of ten, stating that ''Womb Ghosts'' "has some squirmy moments but is shackled by a confused script."<ref name="fba-review" />
