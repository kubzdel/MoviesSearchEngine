'''''Swarm of the Snakehead''''' is a 2006 [[comedy film|comedy]]/[[horror film|horror]] feature film directed by Frank A. Lama and Joel C. Denning and written by Seth Hurwitz. It is the first feature from producers Lama and Hurwitz's [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]]-based production company Ten Pound Films.

''Swarm of the Snakehead'' was shot on [[16 mm film]] in and around [[Easton, Maryland]] between 2002 and 2005. Post-production was completed during the summer of 2006. A rough cut of the film was premiered for friends and family at [[The Charles Theatre]] in Baltimore (where [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] premiered many of his early films) on June 21, 2006. The sold out screening led to several articles in Maryland papers including ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', as well as radio and television appearances.

While making ''Swarm of the Snakehead'', Lama starred in ''[[Fear of Clowns]]'' released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment]] in 2005 and the upcoming ''[[Fear of Clowns 2]]'', which he also produced. At the same time, Hurwitz edited ''Swarm'' and shepherded the film through post-production, working closely with [[sound designer]] Kevin Hill and composer Tom Alonso.
