==Plot==
Set during the 1930s, ''The Matrimony'' follows Shen Junchu([[Leon Lai]]), a cinematographer that's deeply in love with his girlfriend Xu Manli ([[Fan Bingbing]]). Due to his extremely introverted character, Junchu was unable to confess to her how deeply he cared for her. When Manli dies in a freak car accident on the way to their date, Junchu mourns her deeply. Junchu's mother manages to convince him to marry Sansan ([[Rene Liu]]), but he is unwilling to allow her to take Manli's place in his heart. When Sansan discovers a mysterious attic room, she's forbidden to enter by Junchu. She eventually enters the room, only to find the ghost of Manli. Manli offers to help Sansan's unhappy relationship with Junchu, only for the ghost to grow dangerously jealous when Junchu begins to show an attraction for Sansan.<ref>[http://baike.baidu.com/view/741048.htm Baidu Baike page](Chinese language)</ref><ref>[http://movie.douban.com/subject/1890787/ page on movie website Douban.com](Chinese language)</ref><ref>[http://movie.mtime.com/45570/ page on movie website mtime.com](Chinese language)</ref>
