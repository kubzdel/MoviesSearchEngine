===Casting===
After auditioning around 120 people, the directors finally zeroed in on the seven cast members. Each actor brought in their own personality to make the characters more believable. To help the actors be as natural as possible, they used their real names and all the scenes were improvised so as to appear real. The actors were made to rehearse the whole film several times before they came on the sets. Akhlaque Khan (Akki) was not a part of the cast initially. However, with just a couple of weeks to go before the shoot, the actor assigned to play Akki's part bowed out and in came Akhlaque who, eventually won the award for the best actor at the St. Tropez International Film Festival, France [[St. Tropez International Film Festival, France 2013]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tc02.tellychakkar.com/tv/tv-news/akhlaque-khan-wins-the-best-actor-award-the-st-tropez-international-film-festival|title=Akhlaque Khan wins the Best Actor Award in the St. Tropez International Film Festival|publisher=Telly Chakkar|date=June 2, 2013}}</ref>
