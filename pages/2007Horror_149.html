'''''Left for Dead''''' is a 2007 American-[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine]] [[Weird West|horror western]] film directed by [[Albert Pyun]] and starring [[Victoria Maurette]].

== Plot synopsis ==
In [[Mexico]] in 1895, Clementine Templeton is obsessively tracking the wanted man known as Sentenza for deserting her and their infant child. In her travels, she happens upon a gang of former prostitutes led by Mary Black, whose young daughter was also impregnated and abandoned by Sentenza.

They eventually locate their prey and corner him in a remote ghost town called Amnesty; which is haunted by the vengeful ghost of slain preacher Mobius Lockhardt, who has made a pact with the devil to remain as an earthbound spirit unable to travel beyond the borders of the town's cemetery and slaughtering any who trespasses.

But there are many secrets surrounding the group and the town of Amnesty, and not everyone's motives are what they appear to be on the surface. As bloody betrayals and misdeeds come back to haunt them, they must confront their pasts if they hope to escape Amnesty and the vengeful wrath of Mobius Lockhardt alive.
