==Production==
To fund the film's production, Belgian producer Eve Commenge created a company to produce ''Amer''.<ref name="desktop">{{cite web|url=http://desktopmag.com.au/blogs/interview-helene-cattet-bruno-forzani-makers-of-amer/|work=Desktop|accessdate=28 January 2012|title=Interview: Hélène Cattet & Bruno Forzani, Makers of Amer}}</ref> Directors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani required more funding outside Belgium and searched for a French co-producer. Producer [[François Cognard]] agreed to co-produce the film.<ref name="desktop" />
The directors found that they only had one third of their original budget, but the producers let them start production regardless based on their experience of making short films for very little money.<ref name="desktop" />

The directors took great preparations before shooting the actors due to the film's low budget. All shots in the film were tested with digital video cameras with the two directors playing all the parts so that nothing unexpected would come up when they began filming with the other actors.<ref name="desktop" />
The film was shot at the [[French Riviera]] and in [[Belgium]].{{cn|date=November 2016}} It took 39 days to shoot.<ref name="desktop" />
