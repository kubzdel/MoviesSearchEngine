==Reception==
''[[Screen Daily]]'' referred to the ''Discopath'' as "an enjoyable oddball genre blending, fun while it lasts but ultimately too niche to make much of an impact, unless with horror fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/discopath/5059016.article|work=[[Screen Daily]]|title=Discopath|author=Adams, Mark|date=July 30, 2013|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated, "Semi-campy slasher pic is for genre fetishists only," and, "It's hard not to feel that Gauthier cares more about mimicking the style of [[giallo]]'s greatest hits than about telling a story."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/discopath-film-review-599316|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Discopath: Film Review|date=August 4, 2013|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref> [[Indiewire]] gave the film a D- rating, citing poor quality dubbing and production values as well as stating, "This is the type of movie that used to be made all the time, by quick-change artists capitalizing on a couple of random trends. But at least there was a genuine sleaze element at work, and the idea that there was a genuine approach and vision that emerged from a generic incompetence with cameras, framing and effects. Now, itâ€™s just an intentional throwback, wrapping everything in intentional artifice to preserve something that was appealing for being primitive and not particularly thought-out. You can't go home again."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/fantasia-film-festival-reviews-return-to-nuke-em-high-vol-1-antisocial-discopath-20130820|work=[[Indiewire]]|title=Fantasia Film Festival Reviews: 'Return To Nuke 'Em High Vol. 1,' 'Antisocial' & 'Discopath'|author=Toro, Gabe|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}</ref>
