==Plot==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Six prep college students and a biker couple travel south towards [[Daytona Beach]] for Spring Break, but a detour leads them into the seemingly idyllic Georgia town of Pleasant Valley, which is holding its annual "Guts and Glory Jubilee" in honor of the [[American Civil War]].

While they stay in the town, completely isolated from the outside world, they are systematically separated and killed in 
gory fashion by the town's residents. Two students manage to escape, but upon alerting the authorities they learn that "Pleasant Valley" is nothing but a [[cemetery]] - a memorial for 2001 [[Confederate Army|Confederate]] villagers who were massacred 140 years earlier by renegade Union troops during the Civil War. A plaque reveals that the town's residents will not rest until the crime has been paid back: 2001 villagers were killed, 2001 Northerners must be killed - an eye for an eye.

As the two students drive away on their [[motorcycle]], they are [[decapitation|decapitated]] by [[barbed wire]]. The heads are picked up by Hucklebilly who walks down the road and fades away.
