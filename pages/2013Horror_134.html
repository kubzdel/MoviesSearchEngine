{{quote|It's been a mad dash, but we've made it across the finish line and ''Mischief Night'' is finished. I could not be more pleased with how it all came together. It looks great and sounds great. The score by Anastasia Devana is powerful and evocative, Richard Vialet's photography is beautiful, and the entire cast gave it everything they had. I think we've made a film which not only will please genre fans, but also a more general audience.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}
Critical reception for the film has been mostly positive.

Jamie S. Rich from ''[[The Oregonian]]'' gave the film a positive review stating, "It works fairly well, and “Mischief Night” should make for a pretty good pregame show the night before Halloween".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rich|first1=Jamie|title='Mischief Night,' a retro slasher movie to kick off Halloween: Indie & art house films |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2013/10/mischief_night_an_old-school_s.html|website=OregonLive.com|publisher=Jamie S.

Felix Vasquez Jr. from ''Cinema Crazed.com'' stated in his review on the film, "Surely it won’t win awards for originality, but it takes a pretty old idea and transforms it in to a very entertaining stalk and slash horror film worth watching".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vasquez|first1=Felix|title=Mischief Night (2013) (DVD) {{!}} Cinema Crazed - Celebrating Film Culture & Pop Culture|url=http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2013/12/19/mischief-night-2013-dvd/|website=Cinema Crazed.com|publisher=Felix Vasquez Jr.|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>
Alan Spencer from ''Cinesploitation.com'' gave the film a positive review stating, "Mischief Night is based more on execution and suspense rather than bloodletting. If you’ve seen them all, I say give this one a try. It stands out against the current standard slasher tripe".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Alan|title=Mischief Night (2013, DVD Review)|url=http://www.cinesploitation.com/mischief-night-2013-dvd-review/|website=Cinesploitation.com|publisher=Alan Spencer|accessdate=7 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108005706/http://www.cinesploitation.com/mischief-night-2013-dvd-review/|archivedate=8 November 2014|df=}}</ref>
Eric Havens  from ''Downright Creepy.com'' however gave the film a negative review stating, "It’s not the fact that Mischief Night is shallow and superficial that makes it such a disappointment, however. It is the obvious moments of promise. With certain allusions to possible themes and story arcs, it becomes very disheartening to see those allusions continually ignored and abandoned. What could have been a fleshed out story of a girl dealing with grief and guilt becomes nothing but a scream session filled with vague intentions and no real resolution. While this fits in fine with the theory of horror film as symbolic sacrifice, it does little to make Mischief Night a good film".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Havens|first1=Eric|title=REVIEW: Mischief Night {{!}} Downright Creepy|url=http://downrightcreepy.com/reviews/review-mischief-night/|website=Downright Creepy.com|publisher=Eric Havens|accessdate=7 November 2014}}</ref>
