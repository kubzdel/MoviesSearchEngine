==Plot==
Angel Williams (Gwen Zamora) is an assistant manager of a Hotel who has just moved  from [[Manila]] to [[Jakarta]] to be with her ex-patriate family. She, is haunted by a weird recurring dream about a young man committing suicide.

One day, her family is slaughtered, leaving no one alive. Her parents, her only sister Safara (Kimberly Ryder), her maid, security, all are dead. She was also chased down and shot by the killer but somehow she manages to survive, having a vivid memory of what the killer looked like, but not knowing who he is.

Angel begins seeing apparitions of her sister and sees visions of events that led to her family's deaths.  A detective investigates the tragedy but believes Angel's experiences are just her psyche acting out. Angel decides to follow the trail her sister's apparitions lead her to and discover who her sister has become in the past few years, with the trail leading straight to the killer himself.

==Music==
The main theme for The Witness is "Before I Die" by Pika Airplay and Izzal Peterson. In the film it serves as the single that Aris' band had just released, with Agung Saga singing to Airplay's vocals. It is used both as an in-story musical number, as well as incidental music, given that half of the song is a ballad which ceases and crashes into a heavier, more emotional instrumental, which is also used for the song's ending track. A promotional version sung by [[Derrick Monasterio]] was released for promotional purposes.

Another song by Izzal Peterson and Pika Airplay is "Aurora" which serves as Aira and Safara's happier love theme.
