==Plot==
Ten years after the events of the [[Monsters (2010 film)|previous film]], four closely knit friends from [[Detroit]]—Michael, Frankie, Inkelaar and new father Williams—are [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers deployed to the Middle East for their first tour as they must deal with the monsters and a new insurgency on the rise. They meet their team leaders, Forrest and Frater. Frater, who has already gone through nine tours, has become estranged from his wife and daughter, who he says is afraid of him. On their first mission, they investigate a farm house and interrogate the owner. During the encounter, one of the gigantic monsters approaches the group and they are forced to gun it down. Three months into their tour, the team receives a [[search and rescue]] mission for four soldiers who have gone missing along a particularly active area.

During a drive, the team's convoy hits a hidden [[improvised explosive device|IED]] which disables both vehicles, killing Forrest and two of their team. Williams, disoriented by the explosion, wanders onto another IED, which detonates, blowing his legs off. The group is then set under fire by insurgents. Rushing Williams to safety, Inkelaar is unable to stabilise Williams, who dies shortly after. Forced to abandon his body, the four remaining escape on foot. After finding another shelter and while recovering from what has happened, Inkelaar is killed by a [[sniper]] while Frankie is wounded before a group of insurgents surrounds them. Frater leads the others into surrendering. After being captured, Michael and Frater are bound and forced to watch as Frankie bleeds to death in front of them. That night, Frater uses the distraction of an approaching monster to disarm and kill one of their guards, and the two of them escape on motorcycles, determined to finish their mission.

After the bikes run out of gas, they continue eastward until they encounter a destroyed school bus. As Frater searches for water, Michael encounters a boy still alive. They briefly debate [[Euthanasia|euthanising]] him until they are rescued by locals, who feed them and give them water in gratitude for saving the boy's life. Michael wanders off with one of the women, and they witness one of the monsters spreading luminescent spores through the night time desert around them, while Frater visits the boy who succumbs to his injuries. Frustrated at their failure to save the boy, Frater angrily reminds Michael of their mission, and the two continue east toward a settlement their men would have gone to. However, they discover there that the soldiers they were meant to rescue had all been killed prior to their arrival. Now enraged by the futility of their mission and the lives lost, Frater snaps and kills one of the villagers. Michael is forced to shoot him to keep him from killing the rest of the family.

Violent tremors prompt Frater to wander out of the village as Michael follows him to their extraction point. As an enormous monster emerges from the sands in front of them, Frater collapses and dies from his injury. The evac helicopter comes in and picks up Michael, who looks on in silence as the screen cuts to black.
