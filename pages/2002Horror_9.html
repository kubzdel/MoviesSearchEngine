'''''Blade II''''' is a 2002 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Blade (comics)|fictional character of the same name]] from [[Marvel Comics]]. It is the sequel of the [[Blade (film)|first film]] and the second part of the [[Blade (film series)|''Blade'' film series]], followed by ''[[Blade: Trinity]]''. It was written by [[David S. Goyer]], who also wrote the previous film, directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]], and had [[Wesley Snipes]] returning as the lead character and producer.

The film follows the human-vampire hybrid Blade in his continuing effort to protect humans from vampires, finding himself in a fierce battle against a group of extremely savage, powerful mutant vampires who seek to commit global genocide of both vampire and human races.  Blade and his human allies are coerced into joining forces with a special elite group of vampires. It takes place two years after the events of the first film.

''Blade II'' was released on March 22, 2002 and was a box office success, grossing over $155 million.  It also received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning praise for its performances, atmosphere, direction, and action sequences, although its script and lack of character development have been criticized.

==Plot==
Two years after the events of [[Blade (film)|''Blade'']], a pandemic known as the "Reaper virus" has spread through the vampire community. Infected vampires are turned into 'Reapers', a mutation of vampires, immune to all vampire weaknesses with the exception of ultraviolet light, who kill humans and turn any vampires they feed on into more Reapers. Unable to contain the Reapers, Vampire Lord Eli Damaskinos sends two emissaries, Asad and his daughter Nyssa, to seek the aid of vampire hunter Blade and his team, consisting of weaponsmith Abraham Whistler and Blade's new assistant Scud. Blade has since recovered Whistler, who had been held captive  and tortured by the group of vampires for 2 years (since the end of the previous film). Whistler had been turned into a vampire by them, and after returning to their headquarters, Blade gives Whistler an anti-virus vampire serum to revert him back to human. After meeting with Damaskinos and his human familiar, lawyer Karel Kounen, they cautiously agree to help due to the danger of the Reapers' uncontrollable hunger and rapid mutation. Asad then introduces Blade and his group to The Bloodpack; a group of vampires trained for the sole purpose of killing Blade. In addition to Asad and Nyssa, The Bloodpack consists of Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Verlaine, her lover Lighthammer, and Priest. To keep them in line and after Reinhardt's racially charged remark, Blade humiliates Reinhardt and plants an explosive charge on the back of Reinhardt's head.

On Blade's advice, the team starts by investigating a [[Prague]] located nightclub frequented by vampires. When they do encounter Reapers, they soon discover their weapons and powers are completely ineffective. Blade is forced to kill Priest after he becomes infected, Lighthammer is wounded (and infected but he keeps this to himself), Whistler deserts his post, and Scud barely survives a Reaper attack by using UV lights to scare them off. Jared Nomak, 'Patient Zero' of the Reaper strain, attacks and nearly kills Blade before a burst of sunlight forces him to retreat. Whistler appears, and says he has been tracking the Reapers to a central nest in the sewers.

The dissection of a Reaper corpse which was trapped by an electronic hatch reveals that most Reapers tend to burn out within twelve hours if they do not feed, as well as having an additional layer of bone, which surrounds and protects their heart. Having learned of this 'Achilles heel', prime weakness, he and Scud create UV projectors for the team.

While searching for the nest, Lighthammer succumbs to the infection, killing Snowman and chasing Verlaine up a manhole ladder before both die of light exposure when Verlaine removes the manhole cover. Chupa turns on Whistler and attacks him, only to die when a group of Reapers attracted to his scent tear him apart. Whistler survives an encounter with Nomak only because he reveals the truth of his condition and situation to Whistler so he can inform Blade. Asad is ambushed, dragged underwater, and killed. Using a special UV emitter bomb pack, Blade kills all of the Reapers with the exception of Nomak and rescues Reinhardt and Nyssa, but is betrayed by Damaskinos and his people, who stun Blade unconscious.

After Damaskinos' betrayal, he reveals that he created The Reaper virus in order to create a new race of vampires based on Blade and that Nomak is in fact his son. Scud turns out to be a familiar loyal to Damaskinos, who also works with Reinhardt. Blade turns the table on Scud, saying he always knew of Scud's true allegiance, and kills him with the bomb he had placed on Reinhardt, earlier. Damaskinos then orders his scientists to dissect Blade so they can learn how to replicate his abilities. After escaping his captors, Whistler brings Blade to a blood pool, where he regains enough strength to kill Reinhardt and his men.

Seeking revenge, Nomak tracks Damaskinos to his private heliport and kills him. He then bites Nyssa, infecting her with the virus while drinking her blood. Blade confronts Nomak, and after a ferocious battle, defeats him. With his now-broken sword, Blade stabs it through the side of Nomak's chest and into his bone-protected heart, slipping it through the bone plates on the side. Nomak then commits suicide to end his suffering by shoving the sword all the way into his wounded heart. Fulfilling Nyssa's dying wish, Blade takes her outside, where she dies while watching the sun rise before she can fully change. The movie ends with Blade in [[London]], where he kills Rush, a vampire he encountered earlier in the movie.

==Cast==
{{div col}}
* [[Wesley Snipes]] as [[Blade (comics)|Eric Brooks / Blade]]: a [[Dhampir|half-vampire]] "daywalker" who hunts vampires. Wesley Snipes stated that while such a character is not going to have much emotional depth, he then stated: "there's some acting involved in creating the character and making him believable and palatable."<ref>{{cite news|author=Bill Higgins |title=A party with a bite |url=http://www.variety.com/vstory/VR1117864777.html |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 1, 2002 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref>
* [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[Abraham Whistler]], Blade's human mentor and weaponsmith.
* [[Ron Perlman]] as Dieter Reinhardt, leader of the Bloodpack, who bears a particular grudge against Blade, and mentions that his mother was killed by his father.
* [[Leonor Varela]] as Nyssa Damaskinos, an unapologetic, natural-born vampire and daughter to Damaskinos. She is unaware of his darker activities, and does not realize that he values his experiments more than her. There is a hint of sexual tension between her and Blade, Nyssa recognizing Blade as an honorable warrior after he saves her life.
* [[Norman Reedus]] as Josh / Scud, a young, pot-smoking weaponsmith who aids Blade in Whistler's absence. He is revealed at the end of the film to be a double agent, truly working for Damaskinos, believing that the vampires will inevitably win and he would rather be a pet than cattle.
* [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Eli Damaskinos, an ancient vampire who is obsessed with creating a superior race of vampires as his legacy.
* [[Luke Goss]] as Jared Nomak, [[Index case (medicine)|Patient zero]] and [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] of the Reaper virus, with the result that he retains his mind and tactical abilities where other Reapers are little more than mindless animals. He bears a grudge against his father, Eli Damaskinos for creating him.
* [[Matt Schulze]] as Chupa, a pugnacious member of the Bloodpack who bears a particular grudge against Whistler.
* [[Danny John-Jules]] as Asad, a "well-mannered" member of the Bloodpack. He seems to be the least volatile and most intelligent member, as well as the one most willing to work with Blade.
* [[Donnie Yen]] as Snowman, a mute swordsman and member of the Bloodpack. Yen also served as the [[fight choreographer]] for the film.
* [[Karel Roden]] as Karel Kounen, a "familiar", Damaskinos's human agent and lawyer.
* [[Marit Velle Kile]] as Verlaine, a red-haired member of the Bloodpack and the lover of Lighthammer.
* Darren "Daz" Crawford as Lighthammer, a hulking, hammer-wielding member of the Bloodpack with [[Māori people|Māori]] facial tattoos. He and Verlaine seem to be romantically involved. However, he is infected during the attack on the House of Pain, and subsequently turns during the raid on the Reaper base.
* [[Tony Curran]] as Priest, a Scottish-accented member of the Bloodpack. He is the first Bloodpack member to be infected by the Reaper Virus, and begins to turn. Blade exposes him to sunlight to finally kill him in an act of mercy, as his transformation into a Reaper is agonizing.
* [[Santiago Segura]] as Rush, a vampire flunky in Prague. He seems to be much more timid and cowardly than most vampires.

==Production==
Following the success of the original film, New Line and Marvel made plans for a sequel in 1999. It is said that the film was going to introduce Hannibal King and Frank Drake in the series as well as a time travel storyline where Blade goes years in the future. [[Guillermo del Toro]] was hired to direct ''Blade II'' by New Line production president [[Michael De Luca]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming |title=Helmer scales mountains |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117864489.html |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=March 25, 2002 |accessdate=2008-12-13}}</ref> after [[Stephen Norrington]] turned down the offer to direct the sequel. Goyer and Frankfurt both admired director Guillermo del Toro and believed his dark sensibilities to be ideal for ''Blade II''. Frankfurt first met del Toro when Frankfurt's design company, Imaginary Forces, did the title sequences for ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]''. "I admired ''Mimic'' and got to know Guillermo through that film," says Frankfurt. "Both David Goyer and I have been fans of his since ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]'' and were enthusiastic about him coming on board. Guillermo is such a visual director and has a very strong sense of how he wants a movie to look. When you sign on with someone like Guillermo you're not going to tell him what the movie should look like, you're going to let him run with it." Like Goyer, del Toro has a passion for comic books. "Guillermo was weaned on comic books, as was I," says Goyer. "I was a huge comic book collector... my brother and I had about twelve thousand comic books that we assembled when we were kids, so I know my background." [[Tippett Studio]] provided computer-generated visual effects, including digital doubles of some of the characters, while [[Steve Johnson (special effects artist)|Steve Johnson]] and his company XFX were hired to create the prosthetic makeup and animatronic effects.<ref>{{cite news|author=Ellen Wolff |title=Artists flaunt character development at confab |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117870028.html |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 21, 2002 |accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref>

Del Toro chose not to alter the script too much from the ideas created by Goyer and Snipes. "I wanted the movie to have a feeling of both a comic book and [[Anime|Japanese animation]]," said the director. "I resurrected those sources and viewed them again. I dissected most of the dailies from the first movie; I literally grabbed about four boxes of tapes and one by one saw every single tape from beginning to end until I perfectly understood where the language of the first film came from. I studied the style of the first one and I think Norrington used a tremendous narrative style. His work is very elegant."

Stepping back into Blade's shoes was a challenge Wesley Snipes relished. "I love playing this role. It's fun as an actor to test your skills at doing a sequel, to see if you can recreate something that you did," Snipes says. Peter Frankfurt adds, "Wesley is Blade; so much of the character was invented by Wesley and his instincts are so spot on. He takes his fighting, his weapons and attitude very seriously. He's incredibly focused, but he's also very cool and fun."

"Wesley knows Blade better than David Goyer, better than me, better than anyone else involved in the franchise," adds del Toro. "He instinctively knows what the character would and wouldn't do, and every time he twists something around, something better would come out."

[[Principal photography|Filming]] took place in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]] including the [[Barrandov Studios]], as well as London from March 12, 2001 and concluded July 2, 2001.
