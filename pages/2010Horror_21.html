==Production==
Rosas has stated that he began working on ''Blood Junkie'' partially as "a retaliation against uber-stylized horror filmmaking and the unadulterated rebooting and mutilation of the classic 80s franchises" but also because it was "a stylistic choice based on the materials and film assets I had at my disposal".<ref name="DVDV">{{cite web|title=Drew Rosas: Financing a Dream|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/interview_rosas|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=24 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105519/http://www.dvdverdict.com/interview_rosas|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}</ref> He created half of the music in the film using a Korg polysynth keyboard and Rosas had several of his friends create the other portions of the movie's soundtrack.<ref name="DVDV" /> He had originally planned to make ''Blood Junkie'' as a short 30-40 minute film, but later decided to stretch the film into a feature-length film, adding more material to the film and allowing the actors to improvise on the set.<ref name="DVDV" />

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''Blood Junkie'' was generally positive.<ref name="BDR" /> Common elements of praise centered around Rosas's attempt to make the film feel as if it was made in the 1980s, and ''HorrorNews.net'' commented that they "would not have known the difference" if they had not known the film's creation date beforehand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: Blood Junkie (2010)|url=http://horrornews.net/33895/film-review-blood-junkie-2010/|publisher=HorrorNews.net|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Blood Junkie|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bloodjunkie.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=24 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224121742/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bloodjunkie.php|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}</ref> The reviewer for ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' marked the film as one of their favorite horror films released so far that year, saying that at first they "wondered if this was untalented folks making a bad film or if it was talented folks going out of their way to make a good film that looks like a bad film. Turns out it is the latter."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ambush Bug counts down the best horror films on AICN HORROR since last Halloween â€“ Number 14!!! |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/59160 |publisher=AICN|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> ''[[The San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'' called it a "keeper" and said that Troma "can't help but release a good movie once in a while."<ref>http://www.sfbg.com/2011/04/05/acid-washed-terror</ref>

''[[JoBlo.com]]'' gave the movie a more mixed review, saying that the homages in the movie felt a little "too derivative, without adding much of a twist to the 80s horror conventions" but that ultimately "the effort is still there to provide some nostalgic entertainment, and that's the big thing."<ref>{{cite web|title=BLOOD JUNKIE (review)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/blood-junkie|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> ''ReelFilm'' panned the movie overall, stating that it was a "well-intentioned yet entirely underwhelming low-budget effort."<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Blood Junkie|url=http://reelfilm.com/troma1.htm#junkie|publisher=ReelFilm|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>
