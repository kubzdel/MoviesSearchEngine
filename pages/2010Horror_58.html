==Plot ==
The film opens with a baby [[pliosaur]] swimming away from a broken chunk of Arctic glacier that [[Ice calving|calved]] due to [[global warming]]. Three years later, it is a ferocious [[Predator|predatory]] adult and kills tourists and locals offshore from [[Puerto Vallarta, Mexico]]. The protagonist, Trace, is first to notice the pliosaur and witnesses his friend get eaten, but has trouble convincing people that a creature of such antiquity is still alive and eating people.

==Reception==
Critics and reviewers tended to share similar views on the nature of the film, seeing it as a continuation in the tradition of older [[B movie]] horror/monster films, with the implausible plots, stock sequences and questionable acting typical of that genre.

Critics were divided between those who felt this made it highly entertaining and those who felt this made the film exceptionally poor in quality and panned it for its lack of redeeming features. In both cases though, critics conceded that it stood a chance of becoming a classic of its kind, if for nothing else than for a level of awfulness that mandated watching. April Macintyre of ''Monsters and critics'' gave it a positive review: "''Dinoshark'' is epic!"<ref name="Monsters" /> Referring to "fun films, laced with implausible plots, brilliant poster art and laughable dialogue [that] demanded that you show up ready to suspend disbelief, prepare for a scare and always left the audience entertained", she wrote that some aspects are "hilariously over the top. Think Al Pacino's Cuban accent in ''Scarface'' times ten", but concluded that in the context of its genre, "We wouldn't want it any other way." <ref name="Monsters" />

On the negative side, [[Dread Central]] was condemnatory of the "rubbery" monster, "exceptionally chintzy" effects, and "some of the worst acting ever seen in a Syfy original movie", concluding that users who did not regularly watch "schlocky shark flicks" would probably enjoy laughing at "this silly offering in which half the cast sound like they were voiced over by George Lopez".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/dinoshark-2010 | title = Dinoshark (2010) | accessdate = 2010-06-10 | date = 2010-03-15 | work = Dread Central}}</ref> ''Chicago Now'' gave it one star out of 5 as a "low-budget joker" and "cheesy, mindless fun", stating there had to be a "fun drinking game" in it and the best thing about it was the title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/show-patrol/2010/03/dinoshark-sinks-but-its-a-whale-of-a-good-time.html |title=Dinoshark: 'Dinoshark' sinks, but it's a whale of a good time - Show Patrol |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/show-patrol/2010/03/roger-cormans-back-with-sharktacular-b-movie-mayhem.html |title=Dinoshark: Roger Corman's back with sharktacular B-movie mayhem - Show Patrol |publisher=Chicagonow.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-10}}</ref>
