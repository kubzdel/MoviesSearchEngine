'''''The Device''''' is a 2014 American science fiction horror film directed by Jeremy Berg.  It stars Angela DiMarco and Kate Alden as sisters who must deal with an [[alien abduction]] after one's husband, played by David S. Hogan, becomes obsessed with a strange device.

== Plot ==
Still recovering from a family tragedy in the past, two sisters return home to settle their dead mother's affairs.  In a nearby forest, they come upon a strange device.  The husband of one of the women becomes obsessed with it despite their demands that he get rid of it.  After they experience nightmares and other phenomena, they come to believe it may be the result of the device.  It is eventually revealed to be of alien origin, and the sisters are abducted.

== Production ==
Writer-director Berg pitched the concept of the film – a couple who find an object of possibly alien origin – to Ruthless Pictures after they distributed his previous film, ''[[The Invoking]]''.<ref name=icons>{{cite web|url=http://iconsoffright.com/2014/12/16/icons-of-fright-interview-with-the-device-director-jeremy-berg/|title=Icons of Fright interview With THE DEVICE Director Jeremy Berg!!|last=Smith|first=Jerry|work=Icons of Fright|date=2014-12-16|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Co-writer and producer John Portanova had wanted to write an alien abduction screenplay for a long time, but he experienced writer's block on the second act.  Portanova used Berg's ideas to fill in the missing parts.  Portanova's own film, ''[[Valley of the Sasquatch]]'', was due to start pre-production soon afterward, so they worked to complete production on ''The Device'' early.  Berg and Portanova credited their already existing interest in alien abduction stories as making it possible to complete film's pre-production so quickly.  Shooting took place in Seattle over 12 days.<ref name=trash>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/cgi-bin/articlecreditsb.pl?jeremybergjohnportanova%289-14%29|title=An Interview with Jeremy Berg, Writer/Director, and John Portanova, Writer/Producer of The Device|last=Haberfelner|first=John|work=Search My Trash|date=2014-09-14|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  The film's low budget necessitated a limited number of locations.

== Reception ==
Ryan Pollard of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated it 4/10 stars and, while praising the focus on characters instead of aliens, said the film is slow, cliched, and has a poor payoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/11005-the-device|title=The Device|last=Pollard|first=Ryan|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Howard Gorman of ''Scream'' magazine rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, "If a calculatingly creepy and consuming horror film is what you are in need of then I highly recommend ''The Device''".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/device-film-review/|title=THE DEVICE: Film Review|last=Gorman|first=Howard|work=Scream|date=2015-02-11|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Jess Hicks of [[Bloody Disgusting]] rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that the film should have been a short, as too much of the film was taken up with family bickering.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3326412/review-device-another-cookie-cutter-alien-movie/|title=[Review] ‘The Device’ Is Another Cookie Cutter Alien Movie|last=Hicks|first=Jess|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=2015-01-02|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Ari Drew of [[Dread Central]] rated it 3/5 stars and wrote, "''The Device'' remains a passable, if not sufficiently entertaining film for sci-fi/horror fans who can appreciate a subdued approach to the abduction tale."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/144881/device-the-dvd/|title=Device, The (DVD)|last=Drew|first=Ari|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2016-02-16|accessdate=2016-02-21}}</ref>  Mark L.
