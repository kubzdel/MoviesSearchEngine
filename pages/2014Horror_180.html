==Synopsis==
Jazmin (Luz Cipriota) is an intrepid young reporter that decides to investigate the disappearance of the daughter of a wealthy [[cattle industry|cattle]] businessman. She soon finds that this disappearance is more than what it seems, as the disappearance is related to multiple murders and the resulting story has the potential to give Jazmin a name in the reporting world. As Jazmin delves deeper and deeper into the mystery she also brings herself and her cameraman closer to danger, as someone or someones do not want their activities to be uncovered.

==Development==
Grieco stated that he was inspired to create ''Still Life'' after watching an ''Anima Naturalis'' television spot that focused on animal rights [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=No te pierdas en las olas: Parte IV – Una nueva esperanza|url=http://notas.org.ar/2014/11/21/festival-cine-mar-del-plata-naturaleza-muerta/|publisher=Notas|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=vos>{{cite web|title="Naturaleza Muerta", impresionante tráiler de la primera película de terror con temática vegana|url=http://vos.lavoz.com.ar/cine/naturaleza-muerta-impresionante-trailer-de-la-primera-pelicula-de-terror-con-tematica-vegana|publisher=Vos|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> He stated that he then began to view footage of cruelty inflicted on food animals, which he felt was a double standard because while the cruelty existed it did not deter consumer purchasing rates and seemed to Grieco as if the cruelty was deliberately being ignored.<ref name=vos /> Grieco filmed the movie on a limited budget and actress Cipriota stated that this aspect was part of what drew her to the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Argentina Cipriota: estrenar “Naturaleza muerta” en Cannes fue “inesperado”|url=http://www.somosnoticiascolorado.com/2014/11/17/argentina-cipriota-estrenar-naturaleza-muerta-en-cannes-fue-inesperado/|publisher=Univision Colorado|accessdate=10 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141210092508/http://www.somosnoticiascolorado.com/2014/11/17/argentina-cipriota-estrenar-naturaleza-muerta-en-cannes-fue-inesperado/|archivedate=10 December 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Reception==
''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave ''Still Life'' 3.5 out of 5 skulls, writing that while most of the film- particularly its opening prologue- was extremely powerful, the film's epilogue was "so painfully contrived and farcical that it shirks off the previous 90 minutes and dives headfirst into laughable slasher territory."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Patrick|title=[MHHFF Review] Argentina’s ‘Still Life’ Is an Uneven Slasher-Mystery|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3316922/mhhff-2014-review-still-life/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref>
