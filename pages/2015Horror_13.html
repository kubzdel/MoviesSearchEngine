The film was directed by Mark Polonia, one of the [[Polonia brothers]]. The film uses a relatively unknown cast with the exception of [[Eric Roberts]] as "The Dark Lord".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4471212/ | title=Amityville Death House (2015) | publisher=IMDb | accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.horrornewsnetwork.net/articles/62-horror-movies/11265-amityville-death-house-coming-to-dvd-on-february-24th | title='Amityville Death House' Coming To DVD On February 24th | publisher=Horror News Network | date=28 November 2014 | accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>
