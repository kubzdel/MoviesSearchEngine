'''''Ghost Shark 2: Urban Jaws''''' is a 2015 [[New Zealand]] [[Supernatural film|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by Andrew Todd and Johnny Hall. It was shot on a [[Canon EOS 550D|Canon 550D]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], with additional shooting taking place in [[Christchurch]] and [[Los Angeles]].

==Plot==

The plot concerns the mayor of [[Auckland]] and an "expert ghost shark hunter" as they fight to save the city from a supernatural beast known as Ghost Shark. Despite being labelled "''Ghost Shark 2''", it is not related to [[SyFy]]'s ''[[Ghost Shark (film)|Ghost Shark]]'', and the decision to make it a sequel was made for narrative reasons. The tone of the film is that of a serious drama, despite the seemingly parodic subject material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://roberthood.net/blog/index.php/2010/08/23/jump-starting-the-ghost-shark/|title=Jump-Starting The Ghost Shark |publisher=Undead Backbrain|date=2010-08-23 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}</ref>
