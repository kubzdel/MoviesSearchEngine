'''''The Remains''''' is a 2016 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Thomas Della Bella]] and starring [[Todd Lowe]] as a widower and father named John. In ''The Remains'', John moves his family after his wife passes, but the items that had been left in the house turn out to be haunted.

==Plot==
The film opens with a couple visiting a [[spiritualist]] named Madame Addison at 3:00 AM—the so-called [[wikt:witching hour|witching hour]]—in order to try to find their lost daughter.&nbsp; Due to either ghostly or dæmonic intervention, all five people in the house die that night.

Present day, John, whose wife has recently passed, purchases the same house, having no knowledge of the deaths that occurred there more than a century earlier.&nbsp; He is joined by his elder daughter, Izzy, and his two younger children, Victoria and Aiden.

One day, while playing [[hide-and-seek]], Victoria and Aiden come across a chest in the attic containing some pictures, an old camera, an old doll, and an old pocket watch.&nbsp; Victoria becomes attached to the doll, saying it reminds her of her mother, while Aiden becomes attached to the old camera.

John becomes concerned, but at the same time finds himself becoming attached to the pocket watch.&nbsp; His concern grows when Victoria faints, and grows further when he has a dream in which he brutally murders Aiden in his sleep.&nbsp; When he questions the realtor, however, she claims to know nothing about the house's history.&nbsp; Meanwhile, his elder daughter, Izzy, remains aloof, caring more about spending time with her boyfriend and smoking pot than being an active member of the family.

One day, in the attic, John sees a girl—the same girl for whom the family in 1891 was looking.&nbsp; John thinks it's just some girl who has wandered into their house, but she tells him to "burn them," referring to the contents of the chest, before disappearing.&nbsp; John takes the items that had been in the chest away from the kids and places them in a cardboard box at the end of his sidewalk, but the items reappear in the house.

One night, at 3:00 AM, the younger kids, now fully possessed, beat their father nearly to death.&nbsp; When Izzy comes home, she finds her father, on the cusp of death; he tells her to "burn them."&nbsp; Izzy goes to John's room, collects the items, takes them to the back yard, and burns them.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is too late.&nbsp; The ghost of Madame Addison kills John.

The film ends with the house being sold to another family.
