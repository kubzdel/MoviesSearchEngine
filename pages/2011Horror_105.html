== Synopsis ==
Filmmakers document the exploits of two serial killers.<ref>http://www.moviefone.com/movie/maniac/10084518/main/</ref>

== Background ==
[[Shia LaBeouf]] first directed a [[music video]] for New York-based rapper [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] in 2009, for his track "I Never Knew You": "I’m 22 and I’m directing my favorite rapper’s music video,” LaBeouf told ''[[LA Weekly]]'' of the project, "This shit is better than riding unicorns."<ref name="gig">http://www.gigwise.com/features/100362/14-actors-who-have-directed-music-videos</ref> It was through that project that he met Cleveland-bred rapper [[Kid Cudi]], which led to LeBeouf filming and directing Kid Cudi's video for "[[Marijuana (song)|Marijuana]]", which was shot at the 2010 [[High Times]] [[Cannabis Cup]] in [[Amsterdam]]. LeBeouf subsequently went on to collaborate with Cudi and Cage on a [[short film]] titled ''MANIAC''.<ref name="gig"/> Kid Cudi first spoke of the short film on March 5, 2011, via his [[Twitter]] feed, when he announced: "[the] maniac horror [[Short film|short]] will be released on [[halloween]], [[Mr. Rager|rager]] short this summer, [[Marijuana (song)|marijuana]] video this spring. i got you guys, no worries."<ref name="twitter.com">{{cite web | url = https://twitter.com/wizardcud/status/44090919305224192 | first = Scott |last = Mescudi | title = Tweet | quote = maniac horror short will be released on halloween, rager short this summer, marijuana video this spring. i got you guys, no worries | date = 5 March 2011| publisher = Twitter}}</ref>

The short film was inspired by Cudi's song of the same name, from his 2010 album ''[[Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager]]'' and is an homage to the 1992 [[Belgian]] [[black comedy]] crime mockumentary, ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/01/maniac-shia-labeouf-kid-cudi_n_1070546.html |title='Maniac' By Shia LaBeouf, Starring Kid Cudi (VIDEO) (NSFW) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2014-01-09 |first=Mallika |last=Rao}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/10/video-kid-cudi-maniac-directed-by-shia-labeouf |title=Video: Kid Cudi "Maniac" (Directed by Shia LaBeouf) + Bonus Interview |publisher=Complex |date=2011-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-09}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Cudi went into detail about the short film, as he discussed how Shia LaBeouf reached out to him to do the project, playing the role of a killer, funding the video and why was it in French: "It was me creating the back story for this person in my mind. What you see just seems like senseless acts of crime happening but in my character’s mind it was always justified. When you watch it, it’s like, ‘Why are these things happening?’ You want answers but there’s no answers really given. When I was in character, it was always justified for me." He also added "When it came time to shoot, it was as real as possible and you were scared of this character. I literally transformed into this person. I didn’t talk much on set, didn’t crack many jokes, I kept to myself."<ref>http://www.complex.com/music/2011/10/video-kid-cudi-maniac-directed-by-shia-labeouf</ref><ref>http://datnewcudi.com/2011/11/02/kid-cudi-talks-about-the-maniac-short-film-with-complex/</ref>
