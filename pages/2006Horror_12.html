'''''All the Boys Love Mandy Lane''''' is a 2006 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Jonathan Levine]], and starring [[Amber Heard]], [[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]], [[Whitney Able]] and [[Anson Mount]]. The plot centers on a group of popular high schoolers who invite an attractive outsider, Mandy Lane, to spend the weekend at a secluded ranch house, where they are followed by a merciless killer.

Originally completed in 2006, the film premiered at a number of [[film festival]]s throughout 2006 and 2007, including the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], [[Sitges Film Festival]], [[South by Southwest]], and [[London FrightFest Film Festival]]. It received a theatrical release in the [[United Kingdom]] on February 15, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/16117 |author=Miska, Brad|title= 'Mandy Lane' Is Too Much of a Tease, Moving On | work=Bloody Disgusting |date= May 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024091740/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/16117|archivedate=October 24, 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> ''All the Boys Love Mandy Lane'' received extremely divided reviews from critics, with some dismissing the film as "bogus and compromised," and others praising its "[[grindhouse]]" aesthetic and likening its [[cinematography]] to the early work of [[Terrence Malick]]<ref name="guardian" /><ref name="efilm" /> and [[Tobe Hooper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heavemedia.com/2013/10/13/movie-review-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane/|work=Heave Media|title=Movie review: "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"|last=Suzanne-Mayer|first=Dominick|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref>

Despite its international attention, the film went unreleased in the United States for over seven years after it was completed; this was due to complications with its distributor, Senator Entertainment, which went bankrupt shortly after purchasing the film from [[The Weinstein Company]]. On March 8, 2013, it was announced that The Weinstein Company had re-acquired the rights to theatrically release the film in the United States. The film became available through [[video on demand]] in September 2013, and was given a [[limited release]] on October 11, 2013, through a joint contract between Senator Entertainment and Weinstein's subsidiary label [[The Weinstein Company|Radius-TWC]].

==Plot==
At a [[Texas]] high school, Mandy Lane is an outsider who blossoms over the summer and starts getting a great deal of attention from her male classmates. One of those classmates, Dylan, invites Mandy to a pool party at his house and she accepts with the provision that her best friend, Emmet can come along with her. At the party, Dylan attacks Emmet, and holds his head under water in the pool until Mandy intercedes. As revenge, Emmet convinces a drunken Dylan to jump off the roof into the pool, but he hits his head on the cement poolside and dies.

Nine months later, Mandy has since befriended many of Dylan's popular friends, while Emmet has been almost completely ostracized and is subjected to even more intense bullying. Their [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] classmate Red is having a small party at his father's [[cattle ranch]] and invites Mandy along, which she accepts after receiving permission from her aunt.

Mandy, Chloe, Bird, Red, Jake, and Marlin, arrive at the ranch, and meet the ranch hand, Garth. That night, while playing drinking games, Jake gets offended over a joke and storms off to a nearby cattle barn, where Marlin performs [[oral sex]] on him. They have another argument, and after he walks off again, Marlin is knocked out with a [[Double-barrel shotgun|double-barreled shotgun]] by an unseen assailant, and has her jaw broken. Meanwhile back at the house, Jake unsuccessfully attempts to woo Mandy before stealing Red's shotgun and pickup truck to go search for Marlin. After driving a great distance from the house, he finds her sitting by a remote lake. Upon closer look, he sees her mangled face, and is confronted by Emmet, seeking vengeance for the humiliation he has suffered. Emmet shoots Jake in the head before breaking Marlin's neck, killing both. While the remaining friends sit on the house porch, Emmet begins shooting fireworks at them from Red's truck; Bird gives chase, believing the driver to be Jake. When he realizes it is in fact Emmet, they get into a fight, which results in Emmet slashing his eyes with a knife before stabbing him to death. The rest of friends, drunk and high, fall asleep at the house along with Garth.

The next morning, Garth finds the words "wake up" spelled out in bloody alphabet magnets on the refrigerator. As the group attempts to leave out the front door, Garth is shot by Emmet and wounded. While Mandy looks after Garth, Red and Chloe try to run to Chloe's car, but Red is shot in the back by Emmet, who then chases after Chloe in her car. Mandy retrieves the keys to Garth's Bronco from his shack and finds the bloody knife that Emmet used to kill Bird. She goes outside to find Chloe being chased in her direction; Mandy embraces her, but then stabs her in the stomach, revealing that she is helping Emmet with the murders. While Chloe bleeds to death on the ground, Mandy and Emmet discuss the [[suicide pact]] they had planned. Mandy reveals she had no intention of going through with it, convinced that Emmet agreed to the murders only on the basis of winning her affection. Refusing to let her back down, Emmet prepares to shoot her but Garth intervenes by wounding Emmet with his shotgun, prompting Emmet to stab him multiple times. 

Emmet chases Mandy into the fields, where they both fall into a ditch filled with cattle carcasses and get into a fight; Mandy defends herself using a tree log to hold out against Emmet's repeated attempts to swipe her with his machete. The machete becomes stuck to the log and finally she hacks him to death. She returns to Garth, who is critically injured but still alive, and they both drive away from the ranch. Garth thanks Mandy for saving him, incorrectly assuming her to be a victim in Emmet's murder plot.

A [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] shows the group back at a railroad track, where they took a break from their drive. While they are all goofing off, Mandy balances on the tracks, watching her future victims.

==Cast and characters==
* [[Amber Heard]] as Mandy Lane, a shy and pensive teenager at her rural Texas high school. She is both a shy misfit and a popular outsider, who keeps distance from her peers, particularly the males who find her an object of extreme sexual desire; the exception is her best friend, Emmet. Mandy's parents died during her childhood. In conceiving her character, Heard stated that Mandy Lane "[represents] many, many real girls. Many real teenagers, especially in America. There are a lot of incidents of this kind of violence in school with the perpetrators being cute teenagers against their classmates. Their victims are their classmates and they're often their bullies.... [Mandy]'s a great representation of all those girls who are insecure and uncomfortable with their sexuality and their power and yet they're strangely intrigued by it and tempted by it."<ref name="utichi">{{cite interview|first=Amber|last=Heard|interviewer=Joe Utichi|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mandy-lane/news/1708794/amber_heard_on_all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane_the_rt_interview/|work=Rotten Tomatoes|title=Amber Heard on ''All the Boys Love Mandy Lane'': The RT Interview|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref>
* [[Michael Welch (actor)|Michael Welch]] as Emmet, Mandy's best friend who also harbors romantic feelings for her, but, unlike his male counterparts, conceals them. His argument with Dylan in the beginning of the film, which ends with him convincing Dylan to jump from the roof to impress Mandy, resulting in his death— puts a rift between himself and Mandy. Their peers lay blame on Emmet for Dylan's death, and he becomes ostracized by the high school, while Mandy is embraced by his popular oppressors. By him being ostracized and eventual perpetration of the murders led several critics to draw comparisons to [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], the teenagers responsible for the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]]. A notable similarity is that in one scene he is portrayed to be wearing a shirt similar to that worn by Eric Harris on the day of the massacre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyulocal.com/entertainment/2013/09/20/all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-and-now-you-finally-can-too/|work=NYU Local|publisher=New York University|archiveurl=https://archive.is/FwUte|archivedate=May 2, 2018|title=''All The Boys Love Mandy Lane'', And Now You Finally Can Too|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013|last=McEwen|first=Chris}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegridto.com/culture/film/the-losers-revenge-school-violence-and-screen-monsters/|work=The Grid|title=The loser's revenge: school violence and screen monsters|date=October 4, 2013|accessdate=October 25, 2013|last=Anderson|first=Jason}}</ref><ref name="nypost" />
* [[Anson Mount]] as Garth, the ranch hand at Red's parents' [[cattle ranch]] where the teenagers carry out their weekend party. He is years older than them, and the females, particularly Chloe and Marlin, are voraciously attracted to him; it is revealed that he is a war veteran, and that his wife had died before he obtained his job at the ranch. Garth's role is to oversee the property, and his presence is that of a parental figure, as well as an object of affection for the girls, much like Mandy is to the boys.
* [[Whitney Able]] as Chloe, a popular student; a talkative and carefree party girl who exemplifies the stereotypical "airheaded blonde".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/film/16453596/all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-movie-review|work=Time Out Chicago|title=All the Boys Love Mandy Lane: movie review|date=October 9, 2013|last=Floyd|first=Nigel|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Chloe expresses extreme [[Emotional insecurity|insecurity]] issues as well as [[body image]] problems, and continuously belittles her friend Marlin, and asserts Mandy Lane's superior beauty over both of them.
* [[Edwin Hodge]] as Bird, also a member of the high school's select popular elite, is slightly more reserved, and thus more perceptive to Mandy Lane's quiet and fleeting nature. He warns her prior to the party that all the boys there invited her for the sole purpose of trying to bed her, and insists that he's "not like that".
* [[Aaron Himelstein]] as Red, the stoner; the funny and overall nice guy of the popular group whose family's ranch house the festivities take place at. In the beginning of the film, he gives a brief monologue educating the underclassmen about Mandy Lane and the failed attempts from multiple boys to sleep with her; while astutely aware of Mandy Lane's sexuality, Red is not overtly aggressive or flirtatious toward Mandy. He also makes his best attempts to maintain peace in the group, which is evident when a fight breaks out concerning Jake.
* [[Luke Grimes]] as Jake, a hot-headed and overtly sexual teenager and Chloe's ex-boyfriend who is the most forward in his pursuit of Mandy Lane, although all of his attempts at wooing her are either ignored or received with disgust or silent ambivalence.
* Melissa Price as Marlin, a wild, carefree party girl who is constantly belittled and criticized by her insecure best friend Chloe.
* Adam Powell as Dylan, a popular jock who dies after being coerced by Emmet into a failed attempt for Mandy's affection.

Additionally, [[Peyton Hayslip]] appears as Aunt Jo, Mandy's caring aunt and sole guardian and [[Brooke Bloom]] as Cousin Jen, Mandy's cousin and Jo's daughter. [[Robert Earl Keen]] makes a cameo appearance, credited as "Keg Trucker".

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Boys Love Mandy Lane screenshot.png|thumb|right|250px|Director Levine was influenced by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) when crafting the film's [[composition (visual arts)|compositions]] and photography of landscapes<ref name="chronicle" />]]
The film had initially been conceived in 2003 when writer Jacob Forman, producer Chad Feehan, and production designer Tom Hammock were all students at the [[American Film Institute]].<ref name="twitch">{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2011/03/writer-director-chad-sheehan-tells-us-whats-beneath-the-dark.html|work=Twitch Film|title=Writer/Director Chad Feehan Tells Us What's Beneath the Dark|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2013|last=Webb|first=Charles}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/585063-exclusive-interview-jonathan-levine-on-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane|work=Crave Online|title=Exclusive Interview: Jonathan Levine on All the Boys Love Mandy Lane|date=October 9, 2013|accessdate=October 20, 2013|last=Topel|first=Fred|interviewer=Jonathan Levine}}</ref> "I actually started it as my [[thesis]] at AFI," Feehan told [[Twitch Film]].<ref name="twitch" /> "The writer, Jacob Forman and the production designer Tom Hammock and I did it as our thesis together at AFI. We started working on it in 2003, then graduated and got it financed and were able to hire our friends that we graduated with to make the movie. It was obviously quite a journey from 2003 to 2006 when we sold it to the Weinstein Company, and after that it's been pretty trying."<ref name=twitch/>

Levine later told the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' that he and screenwriter Jacob Forman had drawn inspiration from [[Tobe Hooper]]'s ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) as well as the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' and [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films.<ref name="chronicle">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2007-08-10/517895/|work=Austin Chronicle|title=Film News: Forgiveness, All the Boys Love Mandy Lane, and more|date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=October 25, 2013|last=O'Connell|first=Joe}}</ref> According to Levine, he and cinematography Darren Genet had also drawn inspiration from ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]'' (1999) and ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]'' (1993) when developing the film's depiction of teenagers.<ref name="commentary">Levine, Jonathan.

Lead performer Amber Heard said that when she received the script for the film in Los Angeles, she felt it was noticeably "different".  In an interview, she said, "There are so many [scripts] you get where it feels like you're reading the same girl over and over again. And then I read this script and I thought it was truly different and that it could be done well. This was a movie that was really under the radar; no one was really talking about it. It didn't have much money and subsequently it didn't get much attention right off the bat."<ref name="utichi" />

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] began on location in [[Austin, Texas]], and nearby [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]] in 2006, on a budget of $750,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonestarfilmsociety.com/all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane-to-finally-see-wide-release/|work=Lone Star Film Society|title=ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE to Finally See Wide Release|last=Cline|first=Carly|date=April 8, 2013|accessdate=August 25, 2013}}</ref> According to Amber Heard, she spent little time with the rest of the cast when filming wasn't taking place in order to maintain a distance necessary to her character.<ref name="utichi" /> She also said that the shoot was very low-maintenance, saying, "Everyone has these expectations, whether they're subconscious or not, of the glamour and how much fun that you can have in L.A. and I went with those same expectations. This was my first shoot, my first leading role. I fly to my hometown, funnily enough, to film and I stand out in this field waiting for my hair and make-up. Instead of the chair, instead of the lights, I stand in the middle of a field and have, literally, a bucket of freshly-dug mud dumped on my head."<ref name="utichi" />

Anson Mount recalled the film shoot as being "very well organized by the producers. All we had to do was show up to work and have a good time. It was a very aggressive production by what was then a very young company, Occupant."<ref name=anson>{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/fun/612761-exclusive-interview-anson-mount-on-all-the-boys-love-mandy-lane|author=Bibbiani, William|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=May 1, 2018|work=Mandatory|title=Exclusive Interview: Anson Mount on All the Boys Love Mandy Lane|archivedate=May 2, 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/ZKU5i}}</ref>

===Distribution===
Upon the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006, film executive [[Harvey Weinstein]], "in characteristically aggressive deal-making mode," sought to purchase distribution rights after its screening ended around 1:30 am.<ref name=wsj/> By 5:00 am on September 11, 2006, an agreement was reached, and a contract was signed later that morning, with [[The Weinstein Company]] officially purchasing global distribution rights for a reported $3.5 million.<ref name=wsj/> In the contract, Weinstein committed to giving the film a wide release in the United States under the Weinsteins' [[Dimension Films]] branch.<ref name=wsj/> Harvey Weinstein's brother [[Bob Weinstein]], who managed Dimension Films, reportedly did not feel the film warranted a wide release: "I didn't feel that it was the right way to approach an artful film like this," he said.<ref name=wsj/> A [[test screening]] was undertaken in [[New Jersey]], after which less than 30% of the audience reported a positive response, leaving the Weinsteins reluctant to give the film a wide release.<ref name=wsj/> 

Despite the poor test screening, Dimension Films slated the film for a U.S. release of July 20, 2007.<ref>{{cite journal|work=[[The New Yorker]]|title=Movies Opening|p=15|volume=83|issue=18–25|issn=0028-792X}}</ref> However, due to the subsequent financial failure of the studio's ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', among other horror films, the Weinstein Company instead sold the film to Senator Entertainment US.<ref name="MandyLaneSold">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane/news/1653376/ Horror Flick 'Mandy Lane' Gets Bumped and Bought] Rotten Tomatoes, July 17, 2007.</ref> Senator, a German company who had acquired distribution rights for the film in Germany and Austria, had recently established a U.S. branch.<ref name=wsj/> An American release through Senator never materialized, however, after the company's U.S. branch went out of business in April 2009, leaving the film held in limbo with other unreleased projects.<ref name=wsj/> 

In 2008, the film was screened at the [[Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer|Gérardmer Film Festival]], Lyon L'Étrange Festival, and the [[Fantasia Festival|Fantasia Film Festival]], and received a theatrical release in the United Kingdom on February 15, 2008 through [[Optimum Releasing]].<ref>{{cite web|work=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2008/02/11/all_the_boys_love_mandy_lane_2008_review.shtml|title=Review - All the Boys Love Mandy Lane|author=Smith, Neil|date=February 13, 2008|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}</ref> Between 2008 and 2010, it continued to open in various foreign markets, receiving theatrical releases in Germany and Austria (through Senator),<ref name=wsj/> as well as in Sweden, Mexico, Peru, and the Netherlands, among others.<ref name=mojo2/>

Lemire also commented on the film's delayed release history, stating: "Its attempts at examining and subverting the well-worn conventions of the genre in the script from Jacob Forman might have seemed more novel seven years ago.

Thoughtful viewers? What kind of teen slasher movie is this?
