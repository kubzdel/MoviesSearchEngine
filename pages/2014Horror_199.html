'''''Viy 3D''''' ({{lang-ru|Вий}}, internationally known as '''''Forbidden Empire''''', and in the UK as '''''The Forbidden Kingdom''''') is a 2014 [[dark fantasy]] film produced by Russian and Ukraine Film Group and Marins Group Entertainment and loosely based on the [[Nikolai Gogol]] story ''[[Viy (story)|Viy]]''. The film was released in cinemas in Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan on 30 January 2014, in the United States on 22 May 2015 and in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2015.
 
The film is directed by Oleg Stepchenko, based on the first manuscript of Nikolai Gogol. The film has been in production since December 2005 and stopped several times due to lack of funding. In October 2012, the filming was completed.<ref>[http://inter.ua/ru/news/2012/04/02/4778 Закончились съемки фильма "Вий" 3D], The filming of "Viy 3D" completed, Inter Channel, April 2012, {{ru icon}}</ref> ''Viy'' was a huge commercial success, even breaking a record for opening weekend in Russia, but was met with mixed reviews in media.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания.

==Plot==
Early-18th-century [[cartographer]] Jonathan Green undertakes a scientific voyage from Western Europe to the East. Having passed through [[Transylvania]] and crossed the [[Carpathian Mountains]], he finds himself in a small village lost in impassable woods of [[Ukraine]]. Nothing but chance and heavy fog could bring him to this cursed place. People who live here do not resemble any other people which the traveler saw before that. The villagers, having dug a deep moat to fend themselves from the rest of the world, share a naive belief that they could save themselves from evil, failing to understand that evil has made its nest in their souls and is waiting for an opportunity to gush out upon the world.

==Production==
In 2006, Russian producer Alexey Petrukhin and Russian director Oleg Stepchenko decided that they wanted to make a film based on the horror story of [[Viy (story)|''Viy'']] by [[Nikolai Gogol]]. By then, two other projects based on Gogol's tale were in production, such as ''[[Taras Bulba (2009 film)|Taras Bulba]]'' film from 2009 and ''The Witch'' from 2006.<ref>[http://nasha-shumiha.ru/news/vij_v_meru_strashnyj_i_ochen_sovremennyj/2014-01-30-2764 «Вий»: в меру страшный и очень современный — 30 Января 2014 — Газета «Наша Шумиха»<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref>

In order to secure the title, they needed without any further delay to release the information on the forthcoming project. In the course of three days, they filmed a teaser trailer where the role of Khoma Brutus was played by Petrukhin himself. Only after that did the active production of the film begin. When the teaser was shown in theaters, the script was not yet written and the actors were not cast. The story kept growing and changing until it turned from a simple screen version into a big-budget fantasy thriller.<ref>[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу.

The authors understood that the new times set new rules, so in 2011 they made a difficult but very important decision: they decided re-shoot the picture in 3D, even though half of the footage was already filmed. Conversion was out of the question. The decision to re-shoot was not just a PR trick. The re-shooting was taken seriously—the producers developed an innovative technology that had no parallels in the world.<ref>[http://www.marinsgroup.ru/kino/651-lr-3d----23--2014-.html «Вий» выйдет в прокат 23 января 2014 года]</ref>

''Viy'' is an intersection of two storylines. One is the narrative from [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s horror story. The writers used the first edition of the story still untouched by Belinskiy's proofs. The original version has quite different motifs and the whole narrative focuses on a different kind of drama. What's more important, this version abounds in secrets and riddles.<ref>[http://itar-tass.com/ekonomika/952588|title=ФАС получила жалобу на скрытую рекламу водки в фильме «Вий»]</ref> Thus, Gogol's immortal story will be screened without cuts. The second storyline is centered on a real person—[[Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan]] (1595–1685)—a French traveler and cartographer who was the first to study the Ukrainian territories and their people and culture. His research is included in the book ''From Transylvania to Muscovy''. The producers chose his figure because he was also the first to collect and systematize under one cover Slavic myths and legends. De Beauplan was a prototype of the film's main character—Jonathan Green.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref>

=== Filming locations ===
''Viy'' was shot in [[Prague]] at the [[Gatteo]], [[Barrandov]], and Letnyany studios.

The castle in England where Green sets out on his journey is doubled in the film by the Czech [[Sychrov Castle]]. Despite being a few hundred years old—it was built in 1693—it is the newest castle in the [[Czech Republic]]. The legend goes that somewhere in the dungeons of the castle is hidden a treasure guarded by a "Black Lady", a woman dressed in a black gown of mourning. In order to make her figure even scarier, some storytellers began calling the lady of the castle "the Black Widow".<ref>[http://tvrain.ru/articles/mongajt_vij_v_3d_gogol_perevernetsja_v_grobu-361004/?autoplay=false Монгайт. «ВИЙ» В 3D: Гоголь перевернется в гробу. Часть 1]</ref>

The name became so popular that it turned into a cliché and is used every time a female ghost is depicted. It found its way into hundreds of legends around the world. But the locals take the story quite seriously. In order to not shock the tourists staying in the castle overnight, it is forbidden to move any furniture—by morning all of it will be in its original place. The castle guardians explain that "the lady of the house is putting things in order". Zamek Sychrov serves as a film location for the second time already: in 1972 it was the set for Three Wishes for Cinderella.

Most of filming sets were built in [[Czech Republic]].

===Design===
For the location shooting, a life-sized Cossack hamlet, with every historical detail thoroughly reproduced, was built. It included 21 households, a marketplace, a church, a tavern, a mill, a house of pray, and watch towers. Some props were even donated later to historical museums as they were so realistic. The church—the setting for the three notorious nights—was also built for the film from scratch. During the filming of the three nights, the decorators burned over twelve thousand wax candles manufactured according to a special historical design.

The carriage in which the protagonist travels was also designed and built at one of the most famous German automobile manufacturers. The vehicle was designed to be mechanically modern, while its outside appearance was that of a piece of transport from the 18th century. The carriage cost $75,000. A second carriage worth $23,000 was also constructed to double for the interior scenes.

Besides the carriage, the protagonist was equipped with other elaborate technical gadgets—cartographic tools, cryptographic equipment, and even a tablet computer. Costumes were designed by a legend in the Czech movie industry Yarmila Koneczna. She made almost 200 costumes. The main character alone owns six original suits, another seven were made for his doubles and stuntmen.

===Casting===
Several actors were cast for the lead role of Jonathan Green: [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Christian Slater]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Pierce Brosnan]], and [[Jason Statham]].<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref> The producers had official negotiations with each of the actors. It was Jason Statham who recommended his best friend Jason Flemyng for the lead. Flemyng was soon approved by the director and the producers. Christian Slater, after seeing the footage of the film, regretted that he did not appear in the film.<ref>[http://extranews.org/supermodel-natalya-vodyanova-ochen-xotela-sygrat-vedmu-v-filme-vij_110886.html Супермодель Наталья Водянова очень хотела сыграть ведьму в фильме «Вий»]</ref>

=== Special Effects ===
All the stunts and fighting scenes were choreographed by Irzi Kuba.

There are three categories of monsters in the film: made-up artists, animatronics—puppet monsters animated by machines and stunt actors—and virtual 3D ogres. Special make-up artist Petr Gorshenin, who worked on ''Vysotskiy'': Thanks for living on... and other films, said that his work on ''Viy'' was the most complicated and important.

The film is shot in real 3D. Stereoscopic design of the film was done by the German company Stereotec.<ref>[http://www.russianfilmgroup.com/news83.htm Stereotec brought Viy to the New Level]</ref> Special proprietary technology was developed for the film's 3D effects: rfg_BTS (Beyond The Screen), also called Touch3D.

The producer, Alexei Petrukhin, said that originally the film was supposed to be stereoscopic. The scenes that were filmed during the first shooting period (about 20 minutes) were filmed in 2D and postconverted to 3D (in particular, episodes of Pannochka's funeral in the church were filmed that way). In 2011 the production decided to cooperate with Stereotec<ref>[http://stereotec.com www.stereotec.com], Stereotec shooting "Viy 3D", January 2014</ref> for the rest of the movie, a worldwide-operating, Munich-based 3D company. The rest of the picture (the remaining 2 hours) was shot <ref>[http://www.tvbeurope.com/newsletter-3dmasters-content/full/florian-maier-on-viy-calls-for-3d-certification;jsessionid=06911F803BE595694AB947D21323019B#.Ulp46hbDdY4 Interview with Florian Maier about 3D Certification and shooting the Russian 3D feature "Viy"]</ref> with special [[3D rig]]s from Stereotec and Cameras from [[ARRI]] in native 3D.<ref>[http://www.the-village.ru/village/weekend/films/138333-filmy-nedeli-avgust-viy-9-mesyatsev-strogogo-rezhima Фильмы недели: «Август», «Вий», «9 месяцев строгого режима»]. Милослав Чемоданов. 31 января 2014</ref>

The live-action 3D shooting was led by director of stereography [[Florian Maier]] and stereographer Michael Laakmann, both from Stereotec. The native 3D shooting took 60 days and was performed in Czech Republic in 2011 and 2012.

== Release ==
Initially, in order to show that the picture is in production, Alexey Petrukhin and Oleg Stepchenko filmed a teaser trailer, which took them 18 hours to make, where the role of Homa Brutus (character with a bald head) was played by Petrukhin himself. The teaser was shown in cinemas although the script was not yet written and the production of the film actually began a year later.

The announced release date was 12 March 2009 which was timed for the 200th anniversary of [[Nikolai Gogol]], but it was postponed indefinitely since then. After they finished shooting the first film of the trilogy, the producers decided to postpone the premiere until the work on the second film, ''Viy 2'' («Вий-2. Проклятое место»), is complete.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/7252_Viy/videos_filming/?video=8623 История создания. Часть 1 Вий 3D<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref>

On 16 June 2010, a sneak preview of some of the finished episodes was held. The show, held in 3D, was organised by the creators of the film for their American guests, who considered distributing the picture in 80 countries around the world.
