'''''My Bloody Valentine 3D''''' is a 2009 American [[slasher film]] directed by [[Patrick Lussier]], and starring [[Jensen Ackles]], [[Jaime King]], [[Betsy Rue]], and [[Kerr Smith]]. It is a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the 1981 Canadian [[My Bloody Valentine (film)|slasher film of the same name]], and focuses on residents in a small mining town that is plagued by a serial killer on [[Valentine's Day]]. It features supporting performances by [[Tom Atkins (actor)|Tom Atkins]] and [[Kevin Tighe]].

Filmed on location in [[Pennsylvania]], the film was given a [[3-D film|3D theatrical release]] through its distributor, [[Lionsgate]], premiering in the United States on January 16, 2009. It was the first [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rated]] film to be projected in [[RealD Cinema|RealD]] technology and to have a wide release (1,000 locations) in 3D-enabled theaters. It earned $100 million worldwide at the box office.

==Plot==
On [[Valentine's Day|St. Valentine's Day]] 1997, a cave-in traps six miners working in the Hanniger mine in the town of Harmony, a rural mining community. Six days later, rescuers recover a comatose [[The Miner (character)|Harry Warden]] alongside his five co-workers, whom he killed to conserve his own oxygen. Teenager Tom Hanniger is blamed for the incident due to his forgetting to vent the [[methane]] lines, triggering the cave-in.

The following year, Warden, dressed in a gas mask and mining suit, goes on a murderous rampage, making his way to the Hanniger mine, where Tom, girlfriend Sarah, and friends Axel Palmer and his girlfriend Irene are attending a party. Warden murders multiple teenagers in the mine, but Tom, Sarah, Axel, and Irene survive the ordeal. Ten years later, in 2008, Tom inherits the mine after his father's death and returns to Harmony after a decade-long disappearance. He finds Sarah working as a manager of her family's grocery store, married to Axel, now a police officer, and with one son.

Sarah is emotional over Tom's return, and Axel is perturbed by his presence. Axel goes to his father's abandoned home in the woods to have a sexual rendezvous with Megan, a young clerk at Sarah's store; there, she tells him she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Tom checks into a motel, where Irene is having sex with Frank, a trucker. She discovers Frank has filmed their sexual encounter, and she chases him into the parking lot to his truck. As he enters the cab, he is killed with a pick-axe by a man donning a gas-mask and mining gear. Irene hides in a room under a bed, and witnesses the masked killer murder the hotel manager, Selene. The killer discovers her, and stabs her to death with the pick-axe.

Axel arrives at the crime scene and finds Irene's body with her [[heart]] missing. Tom becomes a suspect because of his checking in to the motel that night. At the police station, Axel receives an anonymous heart-shaped box with Irene's heart in it. The next day, Tom goes to visit the mine, and has an encounter with the killer, but the miners disbelieve him. James Burke, the former sheriff, confesses to Tom that he, Tom's father, and Ben Foley, a local politician, killed and buried Warden after his 1998 murder spree, and had the crime covered by the local police department. To prove it, he takes Tom to the site where Warden was buried, but upon their arrival, they find an empty shallow grave.

That evening, Ben is murdered by Warden in his home, and later discovered in Warden's grave with his heart missing. While closing the grocery store, Sarah and Megan are attacked by the killer, and Megan is pulled out a window into an alley and murdered; Axel arrives shortly thereafter, and he and Sarah discover her body in an alley with its heart missing, and the phrase "Be Mine 4 Ever" scrawled in blood. While discussing Megan's murder, Sarah tells Axel she is aware of his infidelity. The killer later infiltrates the Palmer house, killing their babysitter, Rosa, and hiding her body in a washing machine. Burke arrives at the home, and is violently murdered on the front porch 

After being released from the hospital, Sarah leaves with Tom; Axel, convinced Tom is the killer, calls to warn Sarah, telling him Tom has been institutionalized for the last seven years. Alarmed, Sarah attempts to have Tom drive her home, but he refuses. She grabs the steering column, crashing the car. Sarah flees into the woods, and calls Axel from her cell phone. She goes to hide in Axel's father's abandoned house. Inside, she discovers empty heart-shaped boxes, and a high school photo of her with Tom. The killer enters the house, and Sarah flees, running into a mine entrance. While hiding in the mine, she is confronted by Axel, and manages to wrest his gun from him. Tom arrives, and Sarah holds them both at gunpoint. Tom makes mention of Megan's death, confirming to Sarah that he is the killer, as he would not have known she was dead otherwise. In the midst of a [[hallucination]], Tom—who has developed an alternate personality as Harry Warden—sees Warden appear behind Sarah, and begs her to shoot him. Axel grabs the pick-axe and attacks Tom, but is injured in the scuffle.

Sarah and Axel flee into a tunnel, and Tom follows them, smashing the overhead lights as he approaches. Sarah manages to shoot Tom in the side, hitting a fuel tank that results in an explosion, causing the tunnel ceiling to collapse on him. Sarah and Axel escape the mine at dawn. A rescuer finds Tom in the debris, and Tom, still alive, kills him. Disguised as a rescue worker, Tom emerges from the mine and passes by unnoticed.

In a [[post-credits scene]], someone who appears to be Warden is seen wandering the mine tunnels.

==Reception==
The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 57% of 90 critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 5.8 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/my_bloody_valentine_3_d/ | title=My Bloody Valentine (2009) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> However, its reception was relatively better than the original 1981 film, which only had 50% of positive reviews. On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 51 based on 11 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/mybloodyv | title=My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=2009-01-26}}</ref>

Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "director and co-editor Lussier (a frequent Wes Craven collaborator) plays the 3-D gimmick for all it's worth: Everything from tree branches and gun barrels to bloody pickaxes and bloodier body parts appears to jump off the screen. He also makes effective use of the depth-of-field illusion, allowing audiences long views of various chest cavities from which hearts have been rudely ripped. At the very least, the overall tech package is a great deal more impactful than that of the 3-D-lensed ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' (1982)". He added, in spite of the "state-of-the-art 3-D camera trickery, which helmer Patrick Lussier shamelessly exploits to goose the audience with cheap thrills and full-bore gore, ''My Bloody Valentine'' is at heart an unabashedly retro work, reveling in the cliches and conventions of the slasher horror pics that proliferated in the early 1980s".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Leydon | first = Joe | title = My Bloody Valentine

Mark Olsen of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, the implemented 3-D technology enables "startling effects, but after a while the minor thrill of the trick is gone. Advances in digital technology have allowed the filmmakers to largely avoid the physical headaches that are perhaps the biggest hallmark of the cyclical attempts at 3-D moviemaking". He added, "wooden performances by forgettable, generic actors -- again, just like in the original -- don't aid in making things any less leaden", concluding ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' is "just good enough to not be annoying".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Olsen | first = Mark | title = Review: 'My Bloody Valentine 3-D'| journal = [[Los Angeles Times]]  | date = January 17, 2009 | url =http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-mybloodyvalentine17-2009jan17,0,1617827.story | accessdate = January 26, 2009 }}</ref>

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "the creaky screenplay (by Todd Farmer and Zane Smith) is mercilessly at odds with the director's fine sense of pacing. From the moment you duck a flying mandible and gaze, mesmerized, at a severed hand oozing two inches from your nose, you'll be convinced that the extra dimension was worth seeking out. A strange synergy of old and new, ''My Bloody Valentine 3D'' blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce something both familiar and alien: gore you can believe in".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Catsoulis | first = Jeannette | title = Watch Out for That Pickax; It’s Hurtling From the Screen | journal = [[The New York Times]]  | date = January 17, 2009 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/movies/17vale.html?ref=movies&pagewanted=print | accessdate = January 26, 2009 }}</ref>

Clark Collis of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' graded the film a C+ and said that it "starts in spectacular fashion. But what really leaps out at you about ''My Bloody Valentine 3-D'' is its lack of imagination".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Collis | first = Clark | title = Movie Review My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009)| journal = Entertainment Weekly  | date = January 21, 2009 | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20253942,00.html |  accessdate = January 27, 2009 }}</ref> Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt, "While the concept of adding 3-D to the horror genre is hardly new ... Patrick Lussier's film is the most accomplished example. The 3-D effects come fast and furious, rendered with a technical skill and humor that gives this otherwise strictly formulaic slasher picture whatever entertainment value it possesses." He added, "the three leads actually manage to invest their roles with some depth, but the real acting treats come courtesy of veteran character actors Kevin Tighe and Atkins, whose presence provides a comforting bridge to horror films past. 

===Box office===
On its 4-day opening weekend, the film grossed $24.1 million, ranking #3 for the weekend, behind ''[[Gran Torino (film)|Gran Torino]]'' at #2, and ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop]]'' at #1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=003&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results from January 16–19, 2009 | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2009-01-18}}</ref> In its second weekend, the movie grossed estimated $10.1 million, ranking number 6 at the domestic box office.<ref>{{cite journal | last = McClintock | first = Pamela | title = 'Mall Cop' still tops at box office | journal = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 25, 2009 | url = http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117999033.html?nav=news&categoryid=1982&cs=1 | accessdate = January 26, 2009}}</ref> The film grossed $51,545,952 in the United States and Canada, and $49,188,766 in other markets for a worldwide total of $100,734,718.<ref name="BOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mybloodyvalentine09.htm |title=My Bloody Valentine 3-D (2009) |accessdate=2009-03-13 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>
