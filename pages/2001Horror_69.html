'''''Shark Attack 2''''' is a 2000 [[direct-to-video]] [[horror film|horror]] [[film]] based in Cape Town, South Africa

==Plot==
Dr. Nick Harris ([[Thorsten Kaye]]) is a marine biologist hired to deal with the results of an experiment in genetics, a mutated breed of great white sharks have gotten loose on a South African shoreline whilst being transported to an aquarium. The mutant sharks from Dr. Craven's experiments in ''[[Shark Attack (film)|Shark Attack]]'' are back, this time choosing Cape Town, [[South Africa]] as their hunting ground. Two sisters, Amy (Caroline Bruins) and Samantha Peterson (Nikita Ager), while diving near a wreck in the reef are attacked by a shark; Samantha survives. One week later, Dr. Nick Harris and his assistant get the shark and install it as a new attraction at Water World - a Sea World rip-off. When the shark escapes, Nick and Samantha go to hunt it and discover that there are 6 mutant Great Whites living in a cave near the beach, and the Water World's surfing competition might be the next victim. Now they team up with Roy - a Discovery Channel shark hunter - to kill the beasts and save Cape Town. Eventually they succeed in luring the sharks into their cave and blow it up, killing them. Roy is initially believed to have perished but in reality survived.
