==Plot==
A platoon of Swedish Mountain Rangers goes missing in the remote military sector 236 - nicknamed since the [[Viking]] age ''Thor's Wrath''.<ref>http://filmiveckan.blogspot.com/2011/05/spoken-jagarsoldater-och-jan-johansen-i.html</ref> The Swedish government sends captain Palmquist and a special force to investigate. Joining them is the American agent and scientist Johnson. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers goes to hike in the area. Their phones suddenly lose reception and the [[compass]] stops working. Soon, they are killed off one by one by an unseen force. At the headquarters, the Swedish Colonel Stag realises that the American has lied about what he believes to hide in sector 236. He sets out to save his soldiers from walking into a bloodbath.<ref>http://www.filmbizarro.com/view_review.php?review=sektor236.php</ref>
