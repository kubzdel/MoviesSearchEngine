'''''Megalodon''''' is a 2004 American [[horror film]]. It takes place out on a deep sea oil rig. It is known in the UK and other territories as ''Sharkzilla''.

== Plot ==
In the [[North Atlantic]] off the coast of [[Greenland]], a highly advanced deep sea [[Oil platform|oil rig]] has been recently constructed by the company Nexecon Petroleum, and named "Colossus" for its immense size. This "new" type of oil rig can dig deeper and extract more [[oil]] than any other in the world. The fact that this huge rig has been built on fault lines alarms [[geologists]], who are concerned that the delicate ocean floor fault lines in that region might be disturbed through deep drilling, with catastrophic consequences. A [[reporter]], Christen Giddings, has been invited by the [[CEO]] of Nexecon, Peter Brazier, to the oil rig in an attempt to address the concerns of the geologists. Christen is accompanied by a trusted [[cameraman]] Jake Thompson, who will record their findings. The oil rig's crew seem to be convinced that nothing bad will happen, and are skeptical of the geologists. Brazier hopes that a documented report on "Colossus" will reveal that his rig has all the necessary safety arrangements and that the region is stable enough for a drilling operation. As the drilling commences, a rich oil deposit is discovered. However, further drilling is not stopped and an "ocean floor fault line" gets ruptured, which opens a portal to a "mirror" ocean, hidden under the normal ocean for millions of years and containing [[prehistoric]] life. An [[explosion]] occurs and the drilling system collapses. A team of [[engineer]]s descend through a glass [[elevator]] to assess the situation. A giant animal is spotted approaching, which turns out to be the most powerful and fearsome oceanic predator that ever lived, ''Carcharodon megalodon''. A struggle for survival ensues as the crew and geologists attempt to escape from "Colossus", during which several people fall victim to the beast. In a desperate move to stop the monster shark, one of the crew members, Ross, lures it to an open space with his small [[submarine]] and overloads the fuel tanks of the machine, resulting in a gigantic explosion that kills both him and the beast. The ordeal is not over yet as another Megalodon ventures into open waters, passing below a boat with Christen Giddings on board. However she is unaware of its presence.
