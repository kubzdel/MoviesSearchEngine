'''''The Exorcism of Emily Rose''''' is a 2005 American [[supernatural horror film|supernatural horror]] [[trial film]] directed by [[Scott Derrickson]] and starring [[Laura Linney]] and [[Tom Wilkinson]]. The film is loosely based on the story of [[Anneliese Michel]] and follows a self-proclaimed [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] (Linney) who acts as defense counsel representing a [[parish priest]] (Wilkinson), accused by the state of [[negligent homicide]] after he performed an [[exorcism]].

==Plot==
Emily Rose, a 19-year old American teenager, dies of self-inflicted wounds and [[malnutrition]] following an attempted [[exorcism]]. People say she was possessed by 7 demons. Father Richard Moore, the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] diocesan priest who attempted the exorcism is arrested and sent to court. While the archdiocese want Moore to plead guilty to minimize the crime's public attention, Moore instead plans to plead not guilty. Erin Bruner, an ambitious lawyer hoping to use the trial to become a senior partner in her law firm, takes on the case. Moore agrees to let her defend him if he can tell the truth behind Emily's story.

During the trial, Emily's past is told through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s and the evidence provided by witnesses. The trial's prosecutor is Ethan Thomas, a practicing [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]], with Judge Brewster presiding. The prosecution claims Emily suffered from [[epilepsy]] and [[psychosis]] to explain her behavior. Emily received a scholarship to study for a bachelor's degree but displayed signs of [[demonic possession]] after she began attending classes, experiencing visions and physical contortions. Diagnosed with epilepsy, Emily received anti-seizure medication but the treatment failed to cure her. A friend named Jason took Emily back home to her family, where she continued displaying traits of possession until Moore was summoned to attempt an exorcism.

Bruner begins experiencing supernatural phenomena at home, waking up at 3:00 a.m. to the smell of burning material. Moore warns her she may be a target for the demons, revealing he too has experienced similar phenomena on the night he was preparing the exorcism. With the prosecution building a strong case, Bruner steps up her own by trying to legitimize Emily's possession. She summons anthropologist Sadira Adani to testify about the beliefs about spiritual possession from various cultures, but Thomas dismisses her claims as nonsense. Graham Cartwright, a medical doctor who attended the exorcism, gives Bruner a cassette tape on which the exorcism was recorded.

Moore is called to the stand where he plays the tape. As seen in a flashback, Moore, Emily's father, Jason, and Dr. Cartwright participate in the exorcism while her mother and sisters pray in the living room. During the [[Lord's Prayer]], Emily attacks, causing the family cats to become agitated and attack Moore. As Jason and Cartwright help Moore, Emily escapes from her restraints, leaps out of a window, and flees to the family barn. The others give chase, Moore continuing the exorcism and demanding to know the demon's name. It responds by revealing there are six demons – those who possessed [[Cain and Abel|Cain]], [[Nero]], and [[Judas Iscariot]], a  member of [[Legion (demons)|Legion]], [[Belial]], and [[Lucifer]] himself. The exorcism abruptly ends when the men render aid to Emily's father, injured by runaway horses. Thomas reasons that Emily's behavior can be explained by learning ancient languages at school and her epilepsy.

Cartwright agrees to testify to authenticate the exorcism and refute the prosecution's medical care. However, he fails to appear at his allotted time, and Bruner goes looking for him. Seconds after finding Cartwright, the doctor is fatally struck by a car. A distraught Bruner retreats to her office and is warned by her boss that if she allows Moore to testify again, he will fire her. Bruner visits Moore in his jail cell, where he convinces her to allow him to tell the rest of Emily's story despite her boss's threat.

The next day, Moore takes the witness stand again and reads a letter that Emily wrote before she died. A flashback reveals that on the morning after the exorcism, Emily was [[Marian apparition|visited by the Virgin Mary]] in a field near her house. Offered a choice between ascending to [[Heaven]] or remaining to become a [[martyr]] but prove the existence of God and demons, Emily chose the latter. Moore explains she then received [[stigmata]] on her arms, but Thomas claims she gained the markings from grabbing a barbed wire fence surrounding the Rose family farm.

The jury ultimately reaches a verdict of guilty but surprise the court by asking Judge Brewster to give a sentence of time served. Although momentarily shocked by the suggestion, she ultimately accepts it, and Father Moore is free to go. Bruner is offered the position she wanted, but declines. Later, Moore and Bruner pay a visit to Emily's grave wherein the former states that the time will come wherein Emily will be declared a saint.

==Production==
The screenplay was written by director [[Scott Derrickson]] and [[Paul Harris Boardman]]; in honor of the contributions of Boardman and other collaborators on the film, Derrickson chose to forgo the traditional "film by" credit. According to Derrickson's [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he chose Boardman as his co-writer because Derrickson sees himself as a believer and Boardman as a [[Religious skepticism|skeptic]], and believed the pairing would provide the screenplay with two different perspectives, thus providing the film some ambiguity as to whether it supports a religious/supernatural interpretation of the events depicted, or a more secular/medical interpretation.

The character of Emily Rose was inspired by the story of [[Anneliese Michel]].<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200559.html| title = What in God's Name?!|work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate =5 December 2016 | first=Eric T. | last=Hansen | date=4 September 2005}}</ref> The film is based on [[Felicitas Goodman]]'s book ''The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} German director [[Hans-Christian Schmid]] made his own film of Michel's story, ''[[Requiem (2006 film)|Requiem]]'', around the same time in late 2006.
