== Plot ==
In [[Buffalo, New York]], 1887, [[List of American heiresses|American heiress]] Edith Cushing (Sofia Wells), the young daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing ([[Jim Beaver]]), is visited by her recently deceased mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, "Beware of Crimson Peak." Fourteen years later in 1901, Edith ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), a budding author, meets Sir Thomas Sharpe ([[Tom Hiddleston]]), an English [[baronet]] who has come to the [[United States]] with his sister, Lucille ([[Jessica Chastain]]), to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. Unimpressed with Sharpe's previous failures to raise capital, Cushing rejects Thomas's proposal. Edith's mother's spirit once again visits her, bearing the same warning.

When Thomas and Edith become romantically involved, both Edith's father and her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael ([[Charlie Hunnam]]), disapprove. Mr. Cushing hires a private detective, Mr. Holly ([[Burn Gorman]]), who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpes. Mr. Cushing bribes the siblings to have Thomas end his and Edith's relationship. Thomas however sends Edith a note explaining his actions. After Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, Edith and Thomas marry and return to [[England]]. They arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated mansion, which is steadily sinking into the [[red clay]] mine it sits atop. While Edith is bathing, a red ghost watches her and lets out a loud roar. Edith turns around to find nothing was there. During this time she plays fetch with a dog. When he returns without the ball, she asks, "Where is it?" From down the hall, the ball rolls down towards her. Edith finds that Lucille is cold towards her. Much to Edith's confusion, Thomas is physically distant and their marriage remains unconsummated.

Gruesome red ghosts begin appearing to Edith throughout the mansion. To calm her, Thomas takes her to the local post office, where she discovers that Thomas had some connection to an Italian woman. They are snowed in for the night and finally make love. Lucille angrily lashes out after their return, frightening Edith. By the time Thomas mentions that the estate is referred to as "Crimson Peak", due to the warm red clay seeping up through the snow, Edith is growing weak and coughing up blood.

Edith explores the mansion and pieces clues together, discovering that Thomas previously married three wealthy women who were fatally poisoned for their inheritances. She realizes she, too, is being poisoned through tea, and that the siblings have had a long-term [[incest]]uous relationship, resulting in a sickly infant that later died. Lucille also murdered their mother after she had discovered her children's incest. Thomas inherited the family manor that, like many aristocratic estates of the era, is no longer profitable; the Sharpes are virtually penniless. The brother and sister began a "marriage and murder" scheme to support themselves 
and finance Thomas's inventions.

Back in the United States, Alan learns what Mr. Cushing had uncovered about the Sharpes prior to his death: Thomas's multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith. When Alan arrives, Lucille demands that Thomas kill him. Thomas, who has fallen in love with Edith and wants to protect her, inflicts a non-fatal stab wound to Alan before hiding him. Lucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate and also confesses that she was the one who murdered Edith's father. Edith stabs Lucille and tries to flee. Thomas promises to help her and Alan escape. Lucille, jealous over Thomas falling in love with Edith, murders him, then pursues Edith. Aided by Thomas's white ghost, Edith kills Lucille with a shovel, and later, she silently says farewell to her husband's ghost before he vanishes.

In the end, Edith and Alan escape the mansion and are rescued, whereas Lucille becomes a ghost, doomed to stay alone in the mansion while playing her favourite piano, for all eternity. The beginning of the end credits imply that Edith has written a novel titled ''Crimson Peak'' based on her experiences.

[[File:Guillermo del Toro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|upright|thumb|Guillermo del Toro at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] promoting the film]]

Del Toro and Robbins wrote the original [[spec script]] after the release of ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' in 2006. It was sold quietly to Donna Langley at Universal. Del Toro planned to direct the film, but postponed the project to make ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', and then again to work on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' films. Langley suggested that del Toro produce the film for another director, but he could not find one he deemed suitable. While directing ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', del Toro developed a good working relationship with [[Legendary Pictures]]' [[Thomas Tull]] and Jon Jashni, who asked what he wanted to do next. Del Toro sent them his screenplays for a film adaptation of ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', a Western adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', and ''Crimson Peak''. The producers deemed the last of these "the best project for us, just the right size". Universal allowed del Toro to move the project to Legendary, with the caveat that they could put up money for a stake in the film.<ref name="deadline">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/guillermo-del-toro-to-helm-crimson-peak-as-next-feature-with-legendary-pictures/|title=Guillermo Del Toro To Helm 'Crimson Peak' As Next Feature, With Legendary Pictures|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>

Del Toro called the film a "ghost story and gothic romance". He has described it as "a very set-oriented, classical but at the same time modern take on the ghost story", and said that it would allow him to play with the genres' conventions while subverting their rules.<ref name="deadline" /> He stated, "I think people are getting used to horror subjects done as [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] or [[B movie|B-value]] budgets. I wanted this to feel like a throwback."<ref name="total" />

Del Toro wanted the film to honor the "grand dames" of the haunted house genre, namely [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' and [[Jack Clayton]]'s ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''. The director intended to make a large-scale horror film in the tradition of those he grew up watching, such as ''[[The Omen]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. He cited the latter as "another Mount Everest of the haunted house movie", praising the high production values and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s control over the large sets.<ref name="deadline" />

British playwright [[Lucinda Coxon]] was enlisted to rewrite the script with del Toro, in hopes of bringing it a "proper degree of perversity and intelligence", but she is not credited on the finished film.<ref name="total">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/guillermo-del-toro-updates-on-crimson-peak-and-pacific-rim-2|title=Guillermo del Toro updates on Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim 2|author=Total Film|publisher=''[[Total Film]]''|date=February 17, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>

[[Jessica Chastain]] confessed in one 2015 interview that when she was a teenager, her looks were reminiscent of the attire worn by her character in the movie. She said: "Perhaps doing Crimson Peak brought all of that love for the gothic aesthetic back. My friend and I used ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula|(1992 movie) Dracula]]'' as our reference...we were Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost. She wore black lipstick and I wore a black-red lip colour, like dried blood almost."<ref>http://www.tv3.ie/xpose/article/fashion/184522/Jessica-Chastain-The-Dracula-look-appeals-to-me</ref>

After attending an early screening, horror writer [[Stephen King]] called the film "gorgeous and just fucking terrifying", and said it "electrified" him like [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[The Evil Dead]]'', whose distribution he helped secure with a rave review in 1982. King's son, writer [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], called ''Crimson Peak'' "del Toro's blood-soaked ''[[The Age of Innocence|Age of Innocence]]'', a gloriously sick waltz through [[Daphne du Maurier]] territory".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/stephen-king-says-guillermo-del-toros-new-movie-f-king-terrifying|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|title=Stephen King says Guillermo del Toro's new movie is 'f---ing terrifying'|last=Collis|first=Clark |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 17, 2015|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}</ref> [[IGN]] reviewer Scott Collura gave the film an 8.5 out of 10 score, saying, "Featuring memorable performances, amazing production design, and a hard edge that is too often lacking in horror films these days, it nonetheless also manages to subvert some long-standing tropes about the gothic romance genre which inspired it."<ref name="ign review">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/crimson-peak-review|title=Crimson Peak Review|work=[[IGN]]|first=Scott |last=Collura|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 17, 2015}}</ref> Writing on [[Roger Ebert]]'s official website and giving the movie four stars out of four, Sheila O'Malley said "Watching del Toro's films is a pleasure because his vision is evident in every frame.
