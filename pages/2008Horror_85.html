== Critics ==

:"''H3 - Halloween Horror Hostel'' is a cheap TV parody on ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' etc. - also a quick reference to ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' was made along the way. I said 'cheap' meaning both 'low budget' as well as 'no serious effort made'. A few good jokes and a lot of lame ones, but at the length of just 70 minutes still easy to sit through. [...] So, very little new to see, just a quick rehash of familiar blueprints to fill an hour and a half (including advertising breaks) in the late night program. [...]".
