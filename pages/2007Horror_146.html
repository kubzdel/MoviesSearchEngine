== Plot ==
{{plot|date=May 2018}}
Eight years after the events of the first film, [[Aroostook County, Maine]] researcher Frank Mills, and his friend Tillman, are collecting specimens at Black Lake, although a crocodile soon pulls Tillman into the water, and kills him. Frank reports this to sheriff James Riley, showing him Tillman's severed body parts. James, Frank, and wildlife officer Emma Warner venture out onto the lake, where they find more of Tillman's body parts. Meanwhile, three friends, Mike, Edie, and Sharon are killed by a crocodile while swimming in the lake. James, Emma and Frank stop at the house of Sadie Bickerman, a woman who has allegedly been feeding the crocodiles, to interrogate her, although she refuses to let them in the house. After they leave, Sadie tricks a photographer into being killed by the crocodiles. James, Emma and Frank go out on the lake again, although a crocodile destroys their boat, forcing them onto shore. A poacher named Struthers and his assistant Ahmad, soon land their plane on the lake, hoping to kill the crocodiles after getting a tip from a local.

Meanwhile, Mike, Edie, and Sharon visit the lake. James, Frank, and Emma return to land to visit a cabin home to an elderly lady named Sadie Bickerman. Emma and James requests a few questions from Sadie about her sister, Delores, who has gone missing, but Sadie declines to answer. On the three adventurers’ scene, Mike, Edie, and Sharon are all killed by a crocodile while swimming.

The sheriff’s son, Scott Riley wanders into the woods, and appears to be stalked by the incoming crocodile. It turns out to be Daisy, the pet dog of Kerri. Scott then meets Kerri and her boyfriend, Thad. Daisy barks about something moving in the lake but Kerri sees nothing. A much more lenient Sadie talks with a photographer at a boat dock before going back to her cabin, and the photographer is captured and killed by a swarm of baby crocodiles while taking pictures.

Riding the boat again, James forcefully hits the brakes, knocking Frank into the lake, but James and Emma bring him back on board to safety. When a crocodile appears, James draws his gun and the crocodile dives under to knock the three off the boat. The boat is demolished, and all three go to land unharmed. The three meet Struthers and Ahmad, who drove a plane to distract the crocodile.

The next scene shows Rachael and Larry, along with Scott, Kerri, and Thad venturing in the woods to some other side of the lake. On the scene of the Sheriff’s team, Deputy Dale Davis comes in to unload the boat, while the crew sets up a tent for overnight camping. They next see a wild boar trapped in a rope net and feed it to the crocodile. The crew neutralizes the crocodile with their guns and Dale ties the mouth with a rope, but the crocodile easily breaks free, severs Dale’s arm and devours him. Frank dies from a fall and the others move on.

On the younger crew’s scene, Rachael mistakes Larry giving her a foot massage for a crocodile that drags her into the lake, killing her. Larry runs away horrified. The other three of the younger crew find eggs in the woods. Thad breaks some eggs and is killed by a crocodile. The Sheriff’s crew feed a boar carcass to one crocodile and Ahmad shoots a harpoon arrow that accidentally touches Struthers' plane. James and Ahmad abandon the boat, and Struthers is thrown off his plane. Ahmad neutralizes the crocodile and lets out a celebrating yell. Thunderstorms strike the night, forcing the crew to their tents. Scott and Kerri are stranded in the woods until they find a horrified Larry. The Sheriff’s crew is wide asleep in their tents until the crocodile attacks and kills Ahmad.

The next morning, Scott, Kerri, and Larry climb a tree to avoid one crocodile. The Sheriff’s gang meets Sadie, who hints that only three of the younger crew are alive. Larry falls from the tree and on top of the crocodile, which kills him. James witnesses the two surviving teenagers, and kills the crocodile with a grenade launcher. Sadie lets the teenagers in her house to be safe, until the elderly woman tricks them into entering the lake. Sadie is then devoured by a crocodile. The police crew battles one crocodile, and Emma kills it by puncturing its mouth with a jackknife. Struthers hangs upside down on a tree and he is killed as his head is severed by the last crocodile. James kills the last one with multiple explosive substances that destroys the crocodile's nest.

At the end, Scott and Kerri express their love with a passionate kiss while James and Emma are leaving the lake together and revealed that Emma took the crocodile's eggs from the nest earlier and sends it to the scientific lab.
