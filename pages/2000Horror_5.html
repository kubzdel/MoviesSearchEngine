==Plot==
Somewhere in Mexico during the summer, an ancient [[Mesoamerican pyramids#Aztecs|Aztec pyramid]], dedicated to the rain god [[Tlaloc]], is discovered. It contains numerous [[Grave goods|artifact]]s as well as a remarkably well-preserved [[mummy]]. All of these items are transported to a university in the United States for study and display; the university is nearly deserted except for six archeology students and their professor. While they are preparing the artifacts for display, one of the students steals an amulet from the mummy's wrist; he gives it to one of the other students, a girl whom he has a crush on. Unfortunately, it turns out that another of the six students is actually a descendant of Aztec priests, and that he needs the amulet as part of a ceremony to Tlaloc. This student resurrects the mummy and sends it to recover the amulet so that he can complete the ritual. The murderous mummy begins killing anyone in its way. The other students learn about the mummy and also discover that the planned ritual to Tlaloc could be extremely destructive. They attempt to survive the mummy's attacks and to prevent the ceremony, but one by one are killed. Eventually, the priest-student chooses one of the remaining female students to be a [[human sacrifice]] to Tlaloc; the last surviving student must rush to save her and stop the ritual and prevent the apocalypse.
