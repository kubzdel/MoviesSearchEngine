'''''Trouble Every Day''''' is a 2001 French [[Sex in film|erotic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Claire Denis]] and written by Denis and Jean-Pol Fargeau. It stars [[Vincent Gallo]], [[Tricia Vessey]], [[Béatrice Dalle]] and [[Alex Descas]]. The film's [[Trouble Every Day (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] is provided by [[Tindersticks]].

Alice Houri, who starred in [[Claire Denis|Denis]]'s previous film ''[[Nénette et Boni]]'' has a small cameo as a girl on a metro who watches Shane.

==Plot==
An American couple, Dr. Shane Brown and his wife, June, go to [[Paris]], supposedly for their honeymoon. In reality, Shane has travelled to [[Paris]] to hunt down [[neuroscientist]] Dr. Léo Sémeneau and his wife, Coré, whom he once knew and was obsessed with.

Despite having once had a prolific career, Léo is now working as a [[General practitioner]] to keep a low profile. He locks Coré up in their house every day but she occasionally manages to escape and violently murder men. To protect her, Léo buries the bodies.

A couple of men who have been casing the Sémeneau home eventually break in where one of them finds Coré in a boarded up room. After she seduces him, they start to have sex, but she violently bites him to death, ripping out his tongue with her teeth.

Meanwhile, a doctor who once worked with Léo gives Shane the couple's address, explaining that Coré is unwell. After Shane rushes to the house he discovers that the house has been broken into and that Coré is covered in blood. He watches her light the house on fire and when she finally becomes aware of his presence she tries to bite him. However, Shane is able to overpower her. He strangles her and leaves her to be consumed by the flames. Just after he leaves, Léo arrives and witnesses the carnage and the dead Coré.

After Coré's death, Shane becomes strange and distant, stopping in the middle of sex with his wife and finishing by masturbating, running away from her, and adopting a puppy. Finally he returns to the hotel where he has sex with a maid, eventually biting her to death.

Later, the film developed a small following who admire it for its themes of [[existentialism]] and its unique take on the [[Horror film|horror]] [[genre]] as well as gender roles. It was given an in depth analysis by ''[[Salon.com]]'' which looked at the intricacies of the film, particularly the metaphorical nature of the narrative. At Film Freak Central, Walter Chaw said, "Plaintive and sad, Claire Denis' ''Trouble Every Day'' is a rare combination of honesty, beauty, and maybe even genius."<ref>[http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/screenreviews/troubleeveryday.htm review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323204452/http://www.filmfreakcentral.net/screenreviews/troubleeveryday.htm |date=23 March 2007 }}</ref> The film has been associated with the [[New French Extremity]].<ref name=jq>Quandt, James, "Flesh & Blood: Sex and violence in recent French cinema", ''ArtForum'', February 2004 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_6_42/ai_113389507] Accessdate: 10 July 2008.</ref>
