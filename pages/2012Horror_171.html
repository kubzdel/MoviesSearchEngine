'''''Sinister''''' is a 2012 British-American [[supernatural horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Scott Derrickson]]. The film stars [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Juliet Rylance]], [[James Ransone]], [[Fred Thompson]], and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. The plot revolves around fictional true-crime writer Ellison Oswalt, who discovers a box of home movies depicting grisly murders in the attic of his new house that puts his family in danger.

''Sinister'' was inspired by a nightmare that co-writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] had after watching ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.<ref name="screengeek.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.screengeek.co.uk/features/article/interview-sinister-writer-c-robert-cargill |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111060203/http://www.screengeek.co.uk/features/article/interview-sinister-writer-c-robert-cargill |archivedate=November 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }} </ref> [[Principal photography]] began in Autumn of 2011 on [[Long Island]],<ref name="screengeek.co.uk"/> with a production budget of $3 million.<ref name="Kaufman"/> In order to add the authenticity of old home movies and snuff films, the Super 8 segments were shot on actual super 8 cameras and film stock.<ref name="LAT">{{cite web|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/sinister-scott-derrickson-on-horror-tavis-smiley-and-the-west-memphis-3/|title=‘Sinister’: Scott Derrickson on horror … and Tavis Smiley|first=Gina|last=McIntyre|date=October 13, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref> The film was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The film premiered at the [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] festival, and was released in the United States on October 12, 2012, and in the UK on October 5, 2012. ''Sinister'' received positive reviews, praising the acting, direction, music, cinematography, and atmosphere, but received some criticism for its use of [[Jump scare|jump scares]] and horror cliches. The film was a box office success, grossing $87.7 million against its budget of $3 million.<ref name="numbers"/>

The film's financial success spawned a sequel, ''[[Sinister 2]]'', released in the United States on August 21, 2015.

==Plot==
[[True crime]] writer Ellison Oswalt moves into a home with his wife Tracy, their 12-year-old son Trevor, and their 7-year-old daughter Ashley. Ellison has moved his family (unbeknownst to them) into a home where a family was murdered, all hanged by ropes on a tree in the backyard. Ellison intends to use the case of the murdered family as the basis for his new book and hopes that his research will reveal the fate of the Stevenson family's fifth member, a 10-year-old girl named Stephanie who disappeared following the murders. Later that night Ellison discovers a screaming, half-naked Trevor in a box having a night terror.

Ellison finds a box in the attic that contains a projector and several reels of [[Super 8 film|Super 8&nbsp;mm]] footage that are each labeled as innocent [[home movies]]. Ellison discovers that the films are actually murder footage depicting different families being murdered in various ways by an unseen person holding the camera. Ellison notes the appearance of a mysterious symbol in the films as well as a strange masked figure. Consulting a local deputy (whom Ellison nicknames Deputy So & So), they discover that the murders took place at different times, beginning in the 1960s and in different cities across the country. He also learns that a child from each family went missing following every murder. The deputy refers Ellison to Professor Jonas, whose expertise is the [[occult]], to decipher the symbol in the films. Jonas tells Ellison that such symbols are that of a [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] deity named Bughuul, who would kill entire families and then take one of their children in order to consume his/her soul.

One night, Ellison hears the film projector running and finds the missing children seated in the attic watching one of the films. Bughuul suddenly appears on camera before physically appearing before Ellison, causing him to fall off the ladder. Ellison takes the camera, projector and the films outside and burns them with petrol. His wife meets him outside and he tells her that they're moving back to their old house immediately. At his old home, Ellison receives a video-message from Jonas, who sends him scans of historical [[Religious images in Christian theology|images]] associated with Bughuul, including the symbol seen in the murder movies; [[early Christians]] believed that images of Bughuul served as a gateway for the demon to come from the spiritual realm to the mortal world, and children who come into contact with these images can be possessed. 

Ellison discovers the unharmed projector and films in his attic, exactly as he did in the new house, along with an envelope of film labeled "''extended cut endings''". Deputy So & So calls and informs him that every murdered family had previously lived in the house where the last murder took place and each new murder occurred shortly after the family moved from the crime scene into their new residence. By moving, Ellison has placed himself and his family in line to be the next victims.

The extra footage depicts the missing children coming onscreen following each murder, revealing themselves to be the killers, before suddenly disappearing. Ellison becomes light-headed, and notices a bright green liquid mixed with his coffee in the cup, along with a note reading "Good Night, Daddy" under the cup before losing consciousness. Ellison awakens to find himself, Tracy and Trevor bound and gagged on the floor. Ashley, under Bughuul's possession, approaches them, filming with the 8&nbsp;mm camera, and murders them all on camera with an axe. Ashley then views the film of her murders while drawing the murder in the lid of the home movies box. The missing children stare at her through the camera, but flee when Bughuul appears. He lifts Ashley into his arms and teleports into the film with her. The box of films is seen sitting in the Oswalt family's attic, now accompanied by Ashley's reel, labeled "''House Painting '12''".

==Production==
===Development===
Writer [[C. Robert Cargill]] says that his inspiration for ''Sinister'' came from a nightmare he experienced after seeing ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', in which he discovered a film in his attic depicting the hanging of an entire family. This scenario became the setup for the plot of ''Sinister''.<ref>[http://www.screengeek.co.uk/features/article/interview-sinister-writer-c-robert-cargill Interview: Sinister Writer Cargill] Screen Geek</ref> In creating a villain for the film, Cargill conceptualized a new take on the [[Bogeyman]], calling the entity "Mr. Boogie". Cargill's idea was that the creature would be both terrifying and seductive to children, luring them to their dooms as a sinister [[Willy Wonka]]-like figure.<ref name="fearnet.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/exclusive-how-sinister-brought-mr-boogie-life/|title=How Sinister Brought Mr. Boogie to Life|publisher=[[Fearnet]]|accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref>

Cargill and co-writer Scott Derrickson ultimately decided to downplay the creature's alluring nature, only intimating how it manipulates the children into murder. In further developing Mr. Boogie, the pair had lengthy discussions about its nature, deciding not to make it a [[demon]] but rather a [[pagan]] deity, in order to place it outside the conceptual scope of any one particular religion. Consequently, the villain was given the proper name "Bughuul", with only the child characters in the film referring to it as Mr. Boogie.<ref name="fearnet.com"/><ref name="io9">[http://io9.com/5951007/how-internet-art-inspired-the-monster-in-ethan-hawkes-sinister How Internet Art Inspired the Monster in Ethan Hawke's Sinister] io9.com</ref>

===Design===
In crafting a look for Bughuul, Cargill initially kept to the idea of a sinister [[Willy Wonka]] before realizing that audiences might find it "silly" and kill the potential for the film becoming a series. Looking for inspiration, Derrickson typed the word "horror" into [[flickr]] and searched through 500,000 images. He narrowed the images down to 15, including a photograph of a [[ghoul]] which was [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] simply "Natalie". Cargill was particularly struck by "Natalie" and decided: "What if it's just this guy?". He and Derrickson contacted the photographer and purchased the rights to use the image for $500. Derrickson explained that the image appealed to him because it reminded him of the makeup and costumes worn by performers in [[black metal]], while remaining unique enough so as not to be directly linked to the genre; Derrickson had previously researched black metal while looking for inspiration for Bughuul's symbol, which is ritualistically painted at the scene of each of the film's murder sequences.<ref name="fearnet.com"/><ref name="io9"/> Some of the background music for these murder sequences was taken from ambient tracks by bands associated with the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]], including [[Ulver]] and [[:de:Aghast|Aghast]].<ref>[http://the-end-of-summer.blogspot.com/2012/11/sinister-other-soundtrack.html Sinister: The "Other" Soundtrack].

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Sinister'' began in autumn of 2011, after [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Juliet Rylance]] signed on to star in the film.<ref>[http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/46527/scott-derricksons-untitled-found-footage-film-gets-sinister-title Scott Derrickson's Untitled Found Footage Film Gets a Sinister Title] Dread Central</ref> The super 8 segments were shot first, using actual super 8 cameras and film stock, in order to maintain the [[aesthetic]] authenticity of home-shot super 8 footage.<ref name="LAT"/> Principal photography took place on [[Long Island]]. In an interview with ''Bleeding Cool'', screenwriter Cargill admitted that Hawke's character got his name (Ellison Oswalt) from writer [[Harlan Ellison]] and comedian/writer [[Patton Oswalt]]. Cargill keeps books by both men on his shelves.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Ryan Lambie of Den of Geek wrote,

{{quote|For the most part, ''Sinister'' is about its protagonist's growing obsession. Director Scott Derrickson (''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', the remake of ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008 film)|The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'') appears to be deeply influenced not just by the horror genre (most obviously ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'') [but also] by such films as [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]'s ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', [[Joel Schumacher]]'s ''[[8mm (film)|8&nbsp;mm]]'', and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Conversation]]''. Like the main characters of those films, Ellison becomes consumed by a mystery, and spends long periods of time engrossed in the pursuit of the truth – like us, he's repulsed by what he sees, but can't quite bring himself to look away.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/22771/sinister-review |author= Lambie, Ryan |title= Sinister review |publisher= [[Den of Geek]] |date= September 25, 2012 |accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref>}}

Reviewer Garry McConnachie of Scotland's ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' rated the film 4 of 5 stars, saying, "This is how Hollywood horror should be done... ''Sinister'' covers all its bases with aplomb."<ref>{{cite news |last= McConnachie |first= Garry |title= Movie review: Sinister |work= [[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date= Oct 2, 2012 |url= http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/movies/movie-dvd-reviews/movie-review-sinister-15-1355220 |accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref>

Lambie, rating the movie 3 of 5 stars, says that despite its "faults, there's something undeniably powerful about ''Sinister''. Hawke's performance holds the screen through its more hackneyed moments, and it's the scenes where it's just him, a projector, and a few feet of hideous 8&nbsp;mm footage where the movie truly convinces. And while its scares are frequently cheap, it's also difficult to deny that ''Sinister'' sometimes manages to inspire moments of palpable dread." The reviewer for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out London]]'' granted only 2 out of 5 stars, saying, "This so-so, occasionally effective horror film combines found-footage creepiness and haunted-house scares – but is stronger on mood than story."<ref>{{cite news |last= Johnston |first= Trevor |title= Sinister (2012) |work= Time Out London |agency= [[Time Out (magazine)]] |date= October 2, 2012 |url= http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/92031/sinister.html |accessdate= October 10, 2012}}</ref>

Some reviewers have criticized the film's preoccupation with outdated technology. Peter Howell of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' (who gave the film 2 out of 4 stars) argues that the movie tries for "old school shocks" but "can't afford a pre-Internet setting."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2012/10/12/sinister_review_mr_boogie_meet_scarier_mr_google.html | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Sinister review: Mr. Boogie, meet scarier Mr. Google}}</ref> Rafer Guzman of ''[[Newsday]]'' wrote that "celluloid is such a warm, friendly old format that it seems unlikely to contain the spirit of, say, a child-eating demon."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/sinister-review-snuff-stuff-1.4098107|title='Sinister' review: Snuff stuff|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref> Academic study of the film, however, tends to view ''Sinister'''s representation of both old and new media formats as a study in [[transmediation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://refractory.unimelb.edu.au/2014/06/26/instagram-olivier/|title=Sinister Celluloid in the Age of Instagram – Marc Olivier|date=June 26, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>
