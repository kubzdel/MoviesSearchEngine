'''''Welcome to the Jungle''''' is a 2007 American [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[mockumentary]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] and starring Sandy Gardiner, Callard Harris, Nickolas Richey and [[Veronica Sywak]]. A stylistic homage to the highly controversial [[Cult film|cult horror film]] ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', the film follows a group of ambitious reporters who run afoul of a bloodthirsty native tribe.

==Plot==
The plot of ''Welcome to the Jungle'' concerns two young couples who go to Southwest New Guinea from [[Fiji]] in order to find [[Michael Rockefeller]], the son of New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] who disappeared back in 1961, and sell an interview with him to the tabloids for $1,000,000. After a close encounter with armed criminals and psychopathic border guards, and after finding evidence that suggests that Michael Rockefeller may still be alive, the group finally makes it to the jungle where Rockefeller was last seen. The group ventures deep into the jungle where they find two Christian missionaries and a middle-aged Australian man who warns the group not to disturb the tribes in the area or else they will be killed. However tensions rise between the two couples which ultimately attracts the attention of local bloodthirsty cannibalistic tribes who then stalk one of the young couples while they are on a makeshift boat in the river and then attack them when they make their way to shore. 

Meanwhile, the next morning the other couple realizes that most of their essential belongings are missing, and they fear that the other couple took their items and went on ahead to find and interview Rockefeller without them. They then decide to go find their friends but end up finding blood and bits of their clothing on the shore where they were kidnapped. Fearing for their welfare the two go deep into the jungle and later that day find the body of the woman of the other couple. Later that night they find half-eaten bodies of the Christian missionaries whom they met earlier and then find their male friend whose legs and arms have been eaten off; they decide to kill him and escape. After escaping from the cannibals, the young couple come across a seemingly friendlier non-cannibalistic tribe who invites them to their village and provides them with food to eat. The couple then talks about what they are going to do with their lives after they escape, but their conversation is cut short when the tribe who invited them knock the young couple unconscious and kill them while their portable camera carries on filming. Seconds later, an old man is seen walking away from the tribe. There is no information of who this old man could be, but there is a possibility that it could be Michael Rockefeller, who has been kept alive by the tribe since he was captured by them in 1961.
