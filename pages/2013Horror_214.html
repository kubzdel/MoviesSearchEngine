'''''World War Z''''' is a 2013 American [[action film|action]] [[horror film|horror]] [[zombie film|zombie]] [[disaster film|disaster]] [[drama film]]<ref>[http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/world-war-z-film-0 WORLD WAR Z (15) - British Board of Film Classification]</ref>
directed by [[Marc Forster]]. The screenplay by [[Matthew Michael Carnahan]], [[Drew Goddard]], and [[Damon Lindelof]] is from a screen story by Carnahan and [[J. Michael Straczynski]], <!-- DO NOT ADD "loosely" OR OTHER POTENTIALLY BIASED LABELS PER WP:W2W -->based on the 2006 [[World War Z|novel of the same name]] by [[Max Brooks]]. The film stars [[Brad Pitt]] as Gerry Lane, a former [[United Nations]] investigator who must travel the world to find a way to stop a [[Zombie apocalypse|zombie pandemic]].

Pitt's [[Plan B Entertainment]] secured the film rights in 2007, and Forster was approached to direct. In 2009, Carnahan was hired to rewrite the script. Filming began in July 2011 in Malta, on an estimated $125 million budget, before moving to [[Glasgow]] in August 2011 and [[Budapest]] in October 2011. Originally set for a December 2012 release, the production suffered some setbacks. In June 2012, the film's release date was pushed back, and the crew returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting. [[Damon Lindelof]] was hired to rewrite the third act, but did not have time to finish the script, and [[Drew Goddard]] was hired to rewrite it. The reshoots took place between September and October 2012.

''World War Z'' premiered in [[London]] on June 3, 2013, and was chosen to open the [[35th Moscow International Film Festival]]. The film premiered in New York, and Los Angeles on June 14, 2013, and released everywhere on June 21, 2013, in the United States, in 2D and [[RealD 3D]]. The film received positive reviews for Brad Pitt's performance and as a realistic revival of the zombie genre, but received certain criticism for the anti-climax and outdated CGI. Regardless, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $540 million against a production budget of $190 million, becoming the highest-grossing zombie film of all time. A sequel was announced shortly after the film's release, and is currently in production.

==Plot==
<!--NOTE FOR EDITORS. THE MANUAL OF STYLE FOR FILMS SAYS PLOT SUMMARIES SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. PLEASE TAKE ANY LENGTHY ADDITIONS YOU WISH TO ADD TO THE TALK PAGE.  -->

Former [[United Nations|UN]] employee Gerry Lane, his wife Karin and their two daughters are in heavy [[Philadelphia]] traffic when the city is overrun by [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]] that are attracted to sound. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to [[Newark, New Jersey]] and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Deputy Secretary-General]] Thierry Umutoni, an old friend of Gerry's, sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreak's source after it is made clear that the Lanes will be removed from the cramped ship if he is not of use.

Gerry and Fassbach fly to [[Camp Humphreys]], a military base in South Korea, where they are attacked on arrival by zombies. Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally shoots himself dead. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg whom the infected ignored. A former CIA operative imprisoned at the base for selling weapons to [[North Korea]] (to help them fight the infection) tells Gerry to go to [[Jerusalem]], where he says a safe zone has been maintained by the Israeli [[Mossad]] since before the outbreak's official acknowledgement. As Gerry and his team return to their aircraft, Karin &ndash; despite knowing his history of dangerous field work &ndash; foolishly rings his satellite phone, attracting zombies who kill several soldiers, with only Gerry and his pilot escaping.

In Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that months earlier, the Mossad had intercepted an Indian military message claiming that Indian troops were fighting the ''[[rakshasa]]'', or "dead spirits". Israel had thereupon quarantined Jerusalem, erecting huge walls around it. Just as Jurgen shows Gerry that Israel is allowing survivors to take refuge in the city, loud celebratory singing from refugees prompts zombies to scale the walls and attack. Jurgen orders some Israeli soldiers to escort Gerry back to his plane. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an old man and an emaciated boy. Soon after, one of Gerry's escorts, a soldier who identifies herself only as "[[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Segen]]" (lieutenant), is bitten in the hand, which Gerry quickly amputates to stop her turning. Gerry and Segen escape on a commercial airliner as Jerusalem is overrun.

Gerry contacts Thierry, and the airliner is diverted to a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) facility outside [[Cardiff|Cardiff, Wales]]. When a stowaway zombie attacks on approach to Cardiff, Gerry uses a grenade to blow the infected out of the aircraft, which also causes the plane to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff his theory, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting somebody with a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.

Gerry and his family are reunited in a safe zone at [[Freeport, Nova Scotia]]. A "vaccine", derived from deadly pathogens, is developed and issued to survivors battling the infected, acting as a kind of camouflage. The vaccine also helps survivors to reach quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. "This isn't the end," Gerry comments, "Not even close. ''Our war'' has just begun."

In August 2011, [[Bryan Cranston]] entered negotiations to join the film in a "small but flashy" role but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Also in August, filming was set to take place along a road on the perimeter of the [[Grangemouth Refinery]] in [[Grangemouth]], Scotland.

===Post-production===
In May 2012, production returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2152926/BAZ-BAMIGBOYE-Spice-Girls-reunite-musical.html |title=Brad's zombie shoot comes back to life |last=Bamigboye |first=Baz |date=May 31, 2012 |work=Daily Mail |accessdate=June 4, 2012 |location=London}}</ref> The following month, screenwriter [[Damon Lindelof]] was hired to rewrite the film's third act with reshoots scheduled to begin in September or October 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kit |first1=Borys |last2=Masters |first2=Kim |date=June 6, 2012 |title=Damon Lindelof to Rewrite 'World War Z' (Exclusive) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/damon-lindelof-world-war-z-prometheus-brad-pitt-335241 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref> However, Lindelof, who also reworked ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'' and co-wrote ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'', did not have time to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' partner, [[Drew Goddard]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Flemming |first=Mike |date=July 11, 2012 |title=Comic-Con: Drew Goddard Scripts New Ending To Brad Pitt's ''World War Z'' |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/comic-con-drew-goddard-scripts-new-ending-to-brad-pitts-world-war-z/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending "abrupt and incoherent" and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told ''Creative Screenwriting'', "To me the big lesson of ''World War Z'' was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.' That doesn't happen a lot. A lot of times they just throw the movie out there and say, 'We'll make all our money opening weekend and then the movie will go away.'

[[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that "the suspense is killer".
