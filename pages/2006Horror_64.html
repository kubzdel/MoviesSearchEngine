==Synopsis==
Dr. Harrison Parker ([[Jeff Fahey]]) is a scientist working at Calgorin Industries who developed the Eden Formula, a chemical which can reproduce organisms and cure various diseases. However, unknown to Parker, deep underground the general area of his industrial district, other Calgorin Industries scientists have created a [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] from Parker's formula, and keep it locked away in a subterranean location in order to impress stockholders. Soon enough, industry spies enter a laboratory at Calgorin Industries so they can steal the formula and pass it off as their own, making millions of dollars.

Nevertheless, the spies accidentally set loose the bloodthirsty Tyrannosaur, which obliterates all objects and beings in the lab and rampages into the streets of [[Los Angeles]]. Parker and his friend Rhonda Shapton ([[Dee Wallace]]) now have to team up with a police officer ([[Tony Todd]]) so that they can stop both the determined rival company of Calgorin Industries and the Tyrannosaurus rex that continuously adds to its [[body count]].
