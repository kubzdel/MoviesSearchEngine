'''''Dracula 2000''''' (also known internationally as '''''Dracula 2001''''')<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vampyreverse.com/about/alternate.shtml|title=vampyreverse, the|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923012714/http://www.vampyreverse.com/about/alternate.shtml|archivedate=September 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> is a 2000 American [[Vampire films|vampire]] [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Patrick Lussier]] and produced by [[Joel Soisson]] and [[Wes Craven]], and starring [[Gerard Butler]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]], [[Justine Waddell]], [[Omar Epps]], [[Vitamin C (singer)|Colleen Fitzpatrick]], and [[Jennifer Esposito]]. The plot follows [[Dracula]], who arrives in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] in the 21st century and seeks out Mary Heller, a descendant of [[Abraham Van Helsing]].

''Dracula 2000'', the promotional title of which is ''Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000'', builds upon [[Bram Stoker]]'s original 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'', with Count Dracula resurrected in contemporary [[United States|America]]. The film was a critical and commercial disappointment, though two direct-to-video sequels, both written and directed by Lussier, were produced.

==Plot==
Matthew Van Helsing, the alleged descendant of the famed 19th century Dutch physician [[Abraham Van Helsing]], owns an antique shop built over the site of Carfax Abbey in [[London]] in 2000. One night, with Van Helsing upstairs, his secretary, Solina, allows a group of thieves, led by her boyfriend, Marcus, into the shop. The thieves infiltrate the shop's underground high-security vault and find a sealed silver coffin protected by a deadly defense system. Based on the level of security surrounding the coffin, Solina and Marcus decide that the coffin’s contents must be valuable, so they escape with it and flee to [[New Orleans]]. When Van Helsing discovers that the coffin has been stolen, he boards a plane to America, telling his apprentice, Simon Sheppard, to remain in London. Simon does not follow these instructions and follows his mentor.

Aboard the plane, one of the thieves manages to open the coffin, revealing the dormant body of [[Count Dracula]]. Dracula awakens and attacks the thieves, causing the plane to crash in the [[Louisiana]] swamps. Dracula survives the crash and travels to New Orleans, where college students Mary Heller and Lucy Westerman are living. Mary is estranged from her family and has recently been plagued by dreams of a strange, terrifying man.

Van Helsing and Simon arrive in New Orleans and destroy the newly turned vampires left in Dracula’s wake. Afterwards, Van Helsing reveals to Simon that he is in fact the original Abraham Van Helsing, who defeated Dracula in 1897. Because he was unable to destroy Dracula permanently, Van Helsing hid the body and prolonged his own life with regular injections of Dracula's blood filtered via [[leech]]es until, one day, he could discover a way to kill Dracula for good. Simon is intrigued by Dracula's hatred of all things [[Christian]] and wonders why he is also particularly vulnerable to silver. Van Helsing also tells Simon about his daughter, Mary, who was taken from England by her mother after the truth about his identity came to light. Since Mary was conceived after Van Helsing began his injections, she shares blood and a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with Dracula, who senses her existence and is in New Orleans to find her.

Van Helsing and Simon try to reach Mary before Dracula does, but fail to do so before Dracula turns Lucy into a vampire. Dracula and his three new brides, Solina, Lucy, and Valerie (a news reporter bitten after the plane crash), corner Van Helsing and kill him. Simon and Mary escape, only to be captured by Dracula shortly thereafter. On a rooftop, Dracula transforms Mary and in the process reveals his secret: he is none other than the Apostle [[Judas Iscariot]], who betrayed [[Jesus]] for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. As he went to hang himself, the rope snapped and as punishment he was cursed to live for two thousand years as a vampire. The three brides appear with Simon, and Dracula tells Mary to bite him. However, Mary takes the opportunity to save Simon's life by faking the bite instead. Then, together Mary and Simon kill the three brides. Angered by this, Dracula tries to throw her from the rooftop. Mary wraps some cable from a large crucifix around Dracula's neck and they both fall from the roof. Dracula hangs as he attempted to do two thousand years before, but this time the rope does not break, and he burns in the first sunlight.

Mary survives the fall and is cured of her vampirism by Dracula saying “I release you” before he dies in the Sun. In the end, she is doubting of whether the sun has truly killed Dracula. She returns him to the vault beneath Carfax Abbey and vows to watch over his ashes should he ever rise again. Her vampirism isn't completely cured as her eyes briefly turned red again.

== Production ==
The initial draft was penned by producer [[Joel Soisson]]. After [[Harvey Weinstein]] purchased the screenplay, he called [[script doctor]] [[Scott Derrickson]] to tell him he had purchased the script solely on the basis of its title and thought that it "sucked." Derrickson, along with [[Ehren Kruger]]<ref name="This week in Hollywood"/> and [[Paul Harris Boardman]],<ref name="The Devil Is Real. Therefore"/> heavily rewrote the screenplay,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/2005/08/scott-derrickson-the-interview.html|title=Patheos, Interview; Derrickson, Scott|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222223324/http://www.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/2005/08/scott-derrickson-the-interview.html|archivedate=December 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> though none are credited in the final film.

== Release ==
''Dracula 2000'' opened at #7 in its first week at the box office with $8,636,567. In its second week, the film had a 56.5% drop-off, but hung onto the #8 spot. The film grossed $33,022,767 domestically and $14,030,858 overseas for a worldwide total of $47,053,625, failing to make back its $54 million budget.<ref name="mojo">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dracula2000.htm|title=Box Office|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65rIAS5po?url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dracula2000.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On its initial video release, it grossed an additional $32 million in the US and Canada and continues to make money worldwide. ''Dracula 2000'' was the sixth-highest-grossing film for Miramax/Dimension Films in 2000, exceeding the box office takes of such expensive Dimension Films releases like ''[[Reindeer Games]]'' and ''[[Impostor (film)|Impostor]]'', as well as Miramax's December opener for that year, ''[[All the Pretty Horses (film)|All the Pretty Horses]]''.<ref name=mojo/>

== Reception ==
The film received generally negative reviews from critics. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a rating of 17% based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 3.6/10. The site's consensus states: "This retelling tries to offer a different spin on the origin of Dracula.

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the film a "C-" score,<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,93618~1~~,00.html Wes Craven Presents: ''Dracula 2000'' | Movie Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703074608/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,93618~1~~,00.html |date=July 3, 2009 }} Owen Gleiberman, ''Entertainment Weekly'', 3 January 2001.</ref> while [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews panned the film, writing: "Of all the indignities to have been visited upon Dracula during the past century (including being the [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|"inspiration" for a cereal]] and a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' [[Count von Count|character]], and being [[Dracula: Dead and Loving It|lampooned by Mel Brooks]]), none is more unsettling than what has happened to the world's most famous vampire in ''Dracula 2000''."<ref>Berardinelli, James.
