==Synopsis==
Doron (Liron Levo) is a security operative sent to [[Lebanon]] with the mission to capture Manzur, one of the people in charge of the terrorist organization [[Hezbollah]]. He's promised that this will be his very last mission and that afterwards he will be left to build a family with his new wife. Fueled by this promise, Doron enters the town where his target is rumored to be hiding but soon discovers that it is filled with infected people intent on biting and spreading a strange new disease. Doron discovers Manzur's daughter Noelle (Yafit Shalev), who claims that her father had actually been working with Israel on a new biological weapon. Now Doron and the others must find a way to stay alive and get to safety.

==Production==
Gafny first came up with the initial idea for the film when he was 11 years old, when he viewed the [[George A. Romero]] films ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' and ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]''.<ref name=THC>{{cite web|last1=Whittington|first1=James|title=Interview With Eitan Gafny Writer, Producer And Director Of Cannon Fodder|url=http://horrorchannel.co.uk/articles.php?feature=8607&category=5|publisher=The Horror Channel|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> He thought that it would be interesting to have a similar film set in Lebanon, featuring the [[Israel Defense Forces]] fighting zombies.<ref name=THC /> Of the film's zombies, Gafny has stated that they are not meant to be seen as representative for either side of the [[Middle Eastern conflicts]] and that for him, the zombies represent hope.<ref name=DC /> Funding for ''Cannon Fodder'' came from multiple sources, including Israeli government-affiliated film funds and a partially successful [[IndieGoGo]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cannon Fodder|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cannon-fodder|publisher=IndieGoGo|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=MNT>{{cite web|last1=Caplan|first1=B.|title=Israel's First Zombie Movie, Cannon Fodder: "We Tried to Piss Everyone Off"|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2013/10/israels_first_zombie_movie_can.php|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> The script's first draft took two weeks to complete and after re-writes and editing, the script for ''Cannon Fodder'' was completed in about three months.<ref name=THC />

==Reception==
Reviewers for Grolsch Film Works and What Culture both panned ''Cannon Fodder'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bitel|first1=Anton|title=FRIGHTFEST 2013: CANNON FODDER|url=http://grolschfilmworks.com/ca/reviews/frightfest-2013-cannon-fodder|publisher=Grolsch Film Works|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> and What Culture wrote "Though spritely shot, the first Israeli zombie flick does little to elevate itself above the garden variety entries to the genre, suffering from poor acting, a generic plot, and laughable visual effects."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Munro|first1=Shaun|title=FrightFest 2013: You’re Next, Hatchet 3, VHS 2 & More Reviewed|url=http://whatculture.com/film/frightfest-2013-youre-next-hatchet-3-vhs-2-more-reviewed.php/10|publisher=What Culture|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> In contrast, [[Ain't It Cool News]] and Nerdly both wrote favorable reviews for ''Cannon Fodder'',<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR looks at WES CRAVEN’S NEW NIGHTMARE! THE DEPRAVED! HAYRIDE! ALIEN AGENDA: PROJECT GREY! HEARTSHOT! ZOLTAN: HOUND OF DRACULA! Israel’s first zombie film CANNON FODDER! Plus PETER CUSHING: A LIFE IN FILM!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/62343#7|publisher=AICN|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> and Nerdly commented "As surprising as much as it is stereotypical, ''Cannon Fodder'' is hands down THE best horror film to come out of Israel, easily surpassing [[Aharon Keshales|Keshales]] and [[Navot Papushado|Papushado’s]] ''[[Rabies (2010 film)|Rabies]]''. For me Israeli horror has a new standard to live up to in Eitan Gafny’s superb zombie flick.
