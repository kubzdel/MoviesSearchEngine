==Plot==
Three days before [[Christmas]], the dysfunctional Engel family come together for Christmas. Max remains a firm believer in [[Santa Claus]], and intends on sending a letter to him. Amongst his family are his parents Tom and Sarah; his teenage sister Beth; his aunt Linda and uncle Howard; their children Howie Jr., Stevie, Jordan, and baby Chrissie; Sarah and Linda’s cantankerous aunt Dorothy; and Tom's mother Omi (Omi means Gran in German), who speaks mostly in [[German language|German]].

Max wants to continue family traditions, but tension between his relatives leads to them losing their Christmas spirit. When his cousins read out his letter to Santa and mocks him for it, he tears up the letter and throws it out the window. That night, a severe [[blizzard]] engulfs the town, and causes a power outage. Beth ventures out to check on her boyfriend, but is chased by a large horned creature. She hides beneath a delivery truck, but the creature leaves a [[jack-in-the-box]] which attacks, presumably killing her.

Tom and Howard leave to search for Beth, finding her boyfriend's house in ruins with the chimney split open and large goat-like hoof prints in the house. Outside, the two are attacked by an unseen monster under the snow. They return home, and board up the windows. Later, a large hook with a living gingerbread man attached lures Howie, Jr. to the chimney, and he is dragged up the chimney despite the family's efforts to save him.

Omi explains the creature hunting them is [[Krampus]], an ancient demonic spirit who punishes those who have lost the Christmas spirit. Omi recounts that when she was a child, her parents and community lost their spirit, as did she, summoning Krampus. He dragged everyone except her to the [[Underworld]], leaving behind a bell [[Christmas ornament|bauble]] with his name on it. The family remains skeptical until monstrous toys, hidden in presents delivered earlier, invade the house. Stevie and Jordan are lured to the attic by Beth’s voice where Jordan is devoured by Der Klown, the jack-in-the-box from before. The family fends off the toys, only for Krampus' elves to leap in through a window, taking Dorothy, Howard, and Chrissie.

Tom decides the family should flee for an abandoned [[snowplow]] on the streets outside. Omi sacrifices herself to distract Krampus, who emerges from the fireplace, attacking her with his bag of toys. Outside, Tom, Sarah, and Linda are dragged under the snow while Stevie is captured by the elves.

Krampus confronts Max, giving him a bell bauble wrapped in a piece of his discarded letter before he leaves, leaving Max distraught. He gives chase to find the elves and all the toys around a hellish pit. Max yells at Krampus that he takes his wish back and throws the bell at him. He begs that they take him instead of Stevie. While it seems Krampus considers this, he has the elves drop her into the pit regardless. Max attacks Krampus, resulting in him holding Max over the pit. Max honestly apologizes for losing his spirit, admitting that he only wanted a decent Christmas with his family and wishing he would restore things to the way they were before his wish. While Krampus seems to accept his apology, he tosses Max into the Underworld nonetheless.

Max awakens in his house on Christmas morning, discovering his family alive and well downstairs, believing that what happened was just a nightmare. But then he unwraps a present containing Krampus' bauble, and the family collectively remembers the previous night to their horror. Their house is shown being watched through a [[snow globe]] in Krampus' workshop, alongside countless others.

==Production==
Dougherty had "always wanted to do a scary Christmas movie", but the idea did not take form until his friends sent him an [[e-card]] featuring the Krampus creature which was, according to him "just love at first sight." Although this, according to Dougherty, happened  in "the ancient times of the internet" the project would not be fleshed out until 2011, at which point he would team up with Zach Shields and Todd Casey to figure out the story.<ref name="Krampusgeek">{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Don|title=Krampus Director Talks His Scary Christmas Movie|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/krampus/251169/krampus-director-talks-his-scary-christmas-movie|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref> On November 21, 2014, [[Allison Tolman]] and Emjay Anthony joined the cast.<ref name="avclub1"/> On March 3, 2015, [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Toni Collette]] joined the cast.<ref name="hollywoodreporter1"/> [[Principal photography]] began on March 12, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evry|first1=Max|title=Legendary Begins Principal Photography on Horror Comedy Krampus|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/419157-legendary-begins-principal-photography-on-horror-comedy-krampus|accessdate=March 16, 2015|publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]] |date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> Creature effects were made by [[Weta Workshop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetaworkshop.com/projects/krampus-2015/|title=Weta Workshop Projects - Krampus|work=[[Weta Workshop]]|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}</ref>

However, he also stated that had Universal not embargoed the reviews two days prior to its release, a wave of mostly positive reviews dropping a few days before release would have boosted its opening accordingly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2015/12/06/box-office-krampus-scares-up-a-christmas-miracle-with-16m-weekend/|title=Box Office: 'Krampus' Scares Up A Christmas Miracle With $16M Weekend|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=December 6, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>
