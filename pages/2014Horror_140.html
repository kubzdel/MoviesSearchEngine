== Synopsis ==
Fiona (Paige LaPierre) is a beautiful and highly intelligent young law student that is eager to take on her latest class, a course in [[criminology]] by Professor Mark Sloan (Randy Irwin). She's horror struck when a series of brutal and seemingly random slayings begin around the campus community, leading Detective Caterson (Sheldon F. Robins) to suspect that it's the work of a [[mass murderer]]. Unwilling to watch the deaths keep piling up without doing anything, Fiona decides to investigate the murders- a decision made partially due to fact that her own father died at the hands of a mass murderer that was never caught or identified. However, as the murders increase Fiona finds that the victims are closely connected to her life and her past, leading her to suspect that someone close to her is the killer.
