==Plot==
A young couple, Zach and Samantha McCall, are about to get married when Zach decides he wants to document their life together since Sam was raised in foster homes and doesn't know much about her history or roots. After their wedding, they go to the [[Dominican Republic]] for their honeymoon. During Carnival, the couple meet a fortune teller (DeMaris Gordon), who declares Sam was "born from death" and repeats to Sam that "they have been waiting" for her. Creeped out, the couple quickly leave. On their way out, a strange man watches them.

They get lost on the way home and a cab driver (Roger Payano) offers to take them to a local club. There are numerous strange symbols marking the area on their way there. At the club, the same man from the fortune teller's watches them and speaks with the cab driver. Unaware they are being trapped, the couple is drugged and taken to an underground chamber beneath the nightclub where a ritual is performed and an unseen force fills the room.

The next morning, Zach and Sam wake in their hotel with no memory of the previous night. 
   
A couple of weeks after the honeymoon, Sam discovers she is pregnant despite claiming to have taken birth control pills "religiously" ever since the wedding. Though shocked, Zach and Samantha are overjoyed and tell their family and friends the news. The couple later attend their first ultrasound scan where the doctor says that the baby looks healthy and Sam is due by the end of March. At that moment, the ultrasound screen goes static but recovers after a moment.

Throughout the course of her pregnancy, Sam begins to experience nosebleeds, stomach bruising, cravings for raw meat (despite being a vegetarian), superhuman strength, telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage whenever she or the baby appear to be threatened. Also, Zach and Sam keep seeing odd-looking people watching them from afar. Sam becomes convinced something is seriously wrong with the baby and that they are being watched. After a second visit to the doctor, a new doctor (Robert Aberdeen) appears and performs an [[Amniocentesis|amnio]] after Sam appears nauseous. He has no answer as to the whereabouts of their original doctor and the couple is suspicious.

Before the couple return home, masked men set up hidden cameras inside their home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby.

When Sam is eight months pregnant, the couple attend a [[holy communion]] at their church. Their usually friendly niece ([[Madison Wolfe]]) is oddly scared of Sam now, and the priest ([[Sam Anderson]]) who officiated Zach and Sam's wedding looks at Sam during the service and violently coughs up blood. Later at home, when Zach is reviewing the communion footage he filmed, he sees the mysterious cab driver from their honeymoon sitting in a pew. He visits the priest in the hospital, who explains the symbol is related to summoning the [[Antichrist]]. He warns Zach that the symbol is the gateway for the Antichrist, and that the followers of the cult will dress the house in ash to prepare for the arrival. After he finds ash all over his house (and the cops will not do anything), Zach chases the people watching their house and finds out where they are living. He asks his sister, Suzie to stay with Sam while he breaks into the supposedly abandoned house at the end of his street where the cult is staying, and there he finds the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage of his house and the missing ultrasound. He is almost caught by the cult when he goes to leave. Performing the ritual with the other cult members is the McCall's mysterious second doctor, as well as the man who has been watching their house and the cult leader (who they initially saw at the fortune teller's place and later at the club). Zach barely manages to escape.

Meanwhile, Suzie goes to check Sam, only to find that she is drawing the cult symbol before being attacked by unseen force.

Upon returning home, Zach finds the house surrounded by the masked men who have been watching them all along. Inside, he finds Suzie dead and hears Sam scream as the house is being destroyed by some unseen force. He finds Sam in the baby's nursery standing in a trance-like state with a knife to her stomach (the knife was a mysterious gift at her baby shower). She is standing atop the cult symbol that she has carved into the floor. Zach screams for her to stop, but she presses the knife to her stomach anyway and there is a violent blast of light. When Zach recovers, he finds Sam lying in her own blood with her stomach cut. Sam cries and wonders if the baby is all right before dying in his arms. Zach breaks down in grief before the cab driver and the second doctor arrive. Zach begs the intruders to leave them alone, but the doctor takes the baby regardless. The baby glows a deep red as he takes it from Sam's body. The cult takes his camera and tapes, removing all evidence. Zach is arrested and interrogated by the police about the death of his wife and sister, and disappearance of his child, crimes for which he looks guilty.

Before the credits, the screen shows another young couple, on their honeymoon in [[Paris]], where the same cab driver offers them a lift, hinting that the events are about to repeat all over again.

==Production==
On December 18, 2012, [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] announced that [[Matt Bettinelli-Olpin]] and [[Tyler Gillett]] would be directing ''Devil's Due'', based upon a script written by Lindsay Devlin.<ref name=ffff>{{cite news |title=Fox Developing Female-Fronted Found Footage Movie (Exclusive) |first=Borys |last=Kit |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/fox-developing-female-fronted-found-403636 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=18 December 2012}}</ref> Fox had approached the two directors (who are part of the filmmaking collective [[Radio Silence Productions|Radio Silence]]) based upon their short ''10/31/98'' in the 2012 horror anthology ''[[V/H/S]].''<ref name=Complex2014>{{cite web|title=Working on Devil's Due|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/01/radio-silence-devils-due-interview/devils-due|publisher=Complex|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett had been approached by several other companies for "haunted house projects" but chose to work on ''Devil's Due'' over the other projects because they felt that the script was a character based "creepy mood piece" that focused on the deteriorating relationship between its two main characters.<ref name=Complex2014 /> In an interview, the directors said they "focused on Zach & Samantha's love story from day one and the horror of watching the person you love degenerate, and being left helpless beyond continuing to love them unconditionally."<ref name="thebitterscriptreader.blogspot.com">{{cite web|title='The Bitter Script Reader: A Chat With Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Co-Director of Radio Silence's DEVIL'S DUE (Part One)'|url=http://thebitterscriptreader.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-chat-with-matt-bettinelli-olpin-co_13.html|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>

The script had been pitched to them as "a found-footage take on ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''," but the directors wanted to find ways to make their movie different from the 1968 film that they both praise and consider a personal favorite.<ref name=Complex2014 /> This included instilling "a fun energy throughout" and "a sense of humor into the script."<ref name=Complex2014 />

Along with Allison Miller, [[Zach Gilford]] was announced to be in the film, which was shot during April 2013 in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Paris]].<ref name=Zach>{{cite web |last=Fleming |first=Mike, Jr. |title=‘Friday Night Lights’ Zach Gilford Lands ‘Devil’s Due’ Lead |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/03/friday-night-lights-zach-gilford-lands-devils-due-lead/ |accessdate=12 January 2014 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=1 March 2013}}</ref>

Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett chose to shoot the film primarily with a Sony PMW-EX3, which they chose so that the film's actors could carry it throughout the film. The Canon 5D, Canon Vixia HF G10 and an iPhone 5 were also used in the production.<ref>{{cite news |title=Radio Silence speaks at 'DEVIL'S DUE' event |first=Christopher |last=Jimenez |url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/radio-silence-speaks-at-devils-due-event/ |work=[[Fangoria]] |date=8 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>

==Promotion==
Fox released its first trailer for the film on October 16, 2013, and a second trailer on December 5, 2013. Whereas the initial marketing campaign focused the intimate thriller aspects of the McCall's love story, later marketing concentrated specifically on the larger horror facets of the film.<ref>{{cite web |last=Anderton |first=Ethan |title=Second Trailer for Satan's Found Footage Pregnancy in 'Devil's Due{{'-}} |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/second-trailer-for-satans-found-footage-pregnancy-in-devils-due/ |accessdate=12 January 2014 |publisher=FirstShowing.net |date=5 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Trailer for Horror Thriller Devil's Due |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=110309 |accessdate=12 January 2014 |publisher=[[CraveOnline|ComingSoon.net]] |date=16 October 2013}}</ref>

On January 14, prior to the release of the film, Fox promoted the movie by releasing a video of footage of an [[Animatronics|animatronic]] baby carriage and demon baby scaring passers-by in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Devil Baby Attack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUKMUZ4tlJg|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> The video went viral shortly thereafter and has had over 20 million views as of January 17, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch: ‘Baby’ terrorises New Yorkers in stunt for horror film Devil’s Due|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/15/watch-baby-terrorises-new-yorkers-in-stunt-for-horror-film-devils-due/|publisher=EuroNews|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

A collector's edition of the Blu-Ray with cover art by Orlando Arocena was released in 2017 alongside 19 MGM & Fox horror films such as ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Joy Ride (2001 film)|Joy Ride]]'' and ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Miska |first=Brad |title=Celebrate Halloween Early with Unique Blu-ray and DVD Designs for 19 MGM and Fox Titles{{'-}} |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3456366/celebrate-halloween-early-unique-blu-ray-dvd-designs-19-mgm-fox-titles/}}</ref>

==Reception==
Critical reception has been negative. The film currently holds a rating of 17% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 53 reviews, with a [[average|rating average]] of 4 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|title=Devil's Due|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/devils_due/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2 February 2014}}</ref> The film's consensus reads: "Derivative and mostly uninspired, ''Devil's Due'' adds little to either the found-footage or horror genres that it's content to mimic."<ref>{{cite web|title=Devil's Due (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/devils_due/|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 34 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews" from critics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/devils-due | title=Devil's Due Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=October 26, 2014}}</ref>

Much of the film's criticism centered upon the film's similarity to other films such as ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'',<ref name="MACNAB">{{cite web|last=MACNAB|first=GEOFFREY|title=Devil's Due: Film review – shock tactics are combined with subtlety and humour|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/devils-due-film-review--shock-tactics-are-combined-with-subtlety-and-humour-9065501.html|publisher=Independent (UK)|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Devil's Due, Mother(s)care|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=138454|publisher=Empire Online|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> an element that ''[[Fearnet]]'' reviewer Scott Weinberg remarked was likely more due to decisions by the film's production company than anything else.<ref name="Weinberg">{{cite web|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|title=Devil's Due (review)|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-devils-due|publisher=Fearnet|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref> Weinberg called the movie "a darkly passionate homage to ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', the similarities are both intentional and affectionate,"<ref name="Weinberg"/> and ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave the film a favorable review, praising the acting of its lead characters, the sense of humor and drawing positive comparisons to the directors' earlier work on ''V/H/S''.<ref>{{cite web|title='Devil's Due' Delivers Some Surprisingly Bloody Goods|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3273500/bd-review-devils-due-delivers-some-surprisingly-bloody-goods/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

However, since initial release the film has found a cult following and director [[Eli Roth]] has been vocal in his support of the film and in a series of posts on his official [[Twitter]] account, wrote "Don't pre-judge ''Devil's Due'' because ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' is a 'holy grail' movie. It's so smart, creative, inventive, and fun. Very very scary. The guys at [[Radio Silence Productions|Radio Silence]] killed it. ''Devil's Due'' is a legit scary, smart, horror film. So many awesome scenes. I loved it."<ref>{{cite web |first=Eli |last=Roth |authorlink=Eli Roth |title=Don't pre-judge #DevilsDue because Rosemary's Baby is a holy grail movie.

==Use of "found footage"==
Common criticism aimed is at the film's use of "found footage" and asks the question "who assembled this footage?".<ref name="MACNAB"/> However, according to the film's directors this was a deliberate choice, "Audiences are way too smart to have the ''this is real'' found footage wool pulled over their eyes anymore,"<ref>{{cite web|title='The Bitter Script Reader: A Chat With Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Co-Director of Radio Silence's DEVIL'S DUE (Part Two)'|url=http://thebitterscriptreader.blogspot.com/2014/01/a-chat-with-matt-bettinelli-olpin-co.html|accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref> and much like ''[[Chronicle (film)|Chronicle]]'', "''Devil's Due'' doesn't pretend to be footage that anyone has found or compiled, it's simply a story told through cameras that exists in that world. In that sense, it's a bit of an experiment that we were able to have fun with and as the character's{{sic}} lives spiral out of control, we're able to mirror that journey visually by shifting to different POVs. The movie begins very bright, very intimate and full of movement, but as the watchers close in our couple we shifted to a lot more of the static cameras that exist in the world, like the security cameras, with much wider frames. We hoped to use that distance and coldness to mirror the despair and hopelessness that was tearing the couple apart."<ref name="thebitterscriptreader.blogspot.com"/> The film intentionally breaks many found footage conventions throughout, including the deliberate absence of a framing device (such as "these tapes were found by the police"), the use of an animated opening quote, a recognizable cast, a non-chronological narrative structure and a music cue becoming the end-credits song.

==Soundtrack==
The film contains [[diagetic]] music from [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Gaslight Anthem]], [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Brenton Wood]], [[Berlin (band)|Berlin]], [[General Public]], and [[Laura Stevenson]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Radio Silence |title=we're excited to have music from @gaslightanthem @Alkaline_Trio & @laurastevenson in devil's due! #DevilsDue |url=https://twitter.com/HiRadioSilence/status/421744707333419008 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=14 January 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>
