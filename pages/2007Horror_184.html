== Plot ==
Reporter [[Ángela Vidal]] ([[Manuela Velasco]]) and her cameraman Pablo are covering the night shift in one of [[Barcelona]]'s local fire stations for the documentary television series ''While You're Sleeping''. While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. Ángela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, Álex and Manu, to the apartment building, where two police officers are waiting. As they approach the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck. 

As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building's residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside. As people begin to panic, Álex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and seriously injured. The old woman then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. Ángela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents, including a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Maricarmen claims she has [[tonsillitis]], and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well.

The injured are put in the building's textile warehouse. A health inspector in [[hazmat suit]] arrives and attempts to treat them. Suddenly, they become aggressive and start attacking other people. The residents flee and Guillem, an [[Internship (medicine)|intern]], is locked in the warehouse. The health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to [[rabies]], and the time in which the disease takes effect varies by blood type. He reveals the disease is traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and Ángela realizes the dog to be Max. When the residents confront Maricarmen, Jennifer turns, vomits blood at her mother's face and flees upstairs.

Sergio handcuffs Maricarmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Leaving the handcuffed Mari behind, they enter an empty apartment along with Ángela, a resident called César, and the health inspector, who has been bitten. César mentions that there might be another way out through the basement, where there is a large drain that is connected to the sewers, but says the keys are in Guillem's apartment. The infected health inspector then bites César, forcing Ángela, Manu and Pablo to escape and fight their way up to Guillem's apartment on the third floor.

Having found the key, Ángela and Pablo leave the apartment and find Manu among the infected. The pair are chased upstairs, and take refuge in the penthouse. They discover a tape recorder which explains the virus' origin. The penthouse's owner was an agent of [[Holy See|the Vatican]]. He was researching and isolating an enzyme believed to be the biological cause of [[demonic possession]]. He located a possessed young girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], kidnapped her and brought her to the penthouse for research. During this time, the enzyme mutated and became viral. The agent, having no other options, sealed Tristana in the house, presumably to let her die of starvation. 

Pablo reaches up with his camera to record around inside the attic. An infected child swipes at the camera and breaks its light, shrouding them in complete darkness. Pablo turns on the night vision and discovers a sealed door. Tristana, now a blind and horribly emaciated figure, emerges and searches the penthouse for food. Ángela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. Ángela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as Ángela is dragged into the darkness screaming.

Balaguero and Plaza had previously directed the 2002 documentary ''OT: la película''.<ref>{{cite web|title=OT: la película|url=http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/film787489.html|work=Filmaffinity|publisher=Filmaffinity - Movieaffinity|accessdate=22 June 2013|language=Spanish|date=2002–2013}}</ref>

The film was also shown in February 2008 at the [[Glasgow Film Festival]] and the co-directors participated in a corresponding interview in which they revealed their influences during the creation of the cinema work: "Our main reference was TV; was not other films, or a tradition of previous features. I think the main influence for us was TV. What we wanted was to build a classic horror story, but, ahh, telling it in the way of a TV show."<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with 'REC' co-directors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2DcAXSQBm8|work=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=GlasgowFilmFestival|format=Video upload|date=8 April 2008}}</ref> ''REC'' was then released in the United Kingdom in April 2008 and a North American DVD release occurred in 2009.

== Reception ==
The review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an 88% approval rating, stating: "Plunging viewers into the nightmarish hellscape of an apartment complex under siege, ''[Rec]'' proves that found footage can still be used as an effective delivery mechanism for sparse, economic horror."<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"/>

Reviewing the film for the [[BBC]], Jamie Russell called it "A runaway rollercoaster of a fright flick", praising the "faux-docu handheld style", and the sense of [[claustrophobia]] and confusion, claiming that "''[Rec]'' will definitely jangle the nerves"; however, Russell criticised the lack of substance and a "one-dimensional" supporting cast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rec (2008)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2008/04/07/rec_2008_review.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=Jamie Russell|date=8 April 2008}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] awarded the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, with the reviewer writing, "''[REC]'' has it all and is probably one of the best Spanish horror films in recent memory."<ref>{{cite web|title=REC (aka [REC] ) (Spain) (V)|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/110405/rec-aka-rec-spain-v-2/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting LLC|accessdate=22 June 2013|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=14 July 2009}}</ref> ''Bloody Disgusting'' later ranked the film eleventh in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article stating: "Out of all the 'shaky-cam' films... this one is arguably the best."<ref>{{cite web|title=00′s Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting’s Top 20 Films of the Decade…Part 2|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/18415/00s-retrospect-bloody-disgustings-top-20-films-of-the-decade-part-2/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting LLC|accessdate=22 June 2013|author=Bloody Disgusting Staff|date=16 December 2009}}</ref> In the early 2010s, ''[[Time Out London|Time Out]]'' conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/best-horror-films|work=[[Time Out London|Time Out]]|accessdate=April 13, 2014|title=The 100 best horror films}}</ref> ''Rec'' placed at number 54 on their top 100 list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-100-best-horror-films-the-list?pageNumber=5|work=[[Time Out London|Time Out]]|accessdate=April 13, 2014|title=The 100 best horror films: the list|author=NF}}</ref>
