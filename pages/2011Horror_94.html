==Plot==
Jenna (Rhodes) invites Rocky (Edmundson), Catalina (Madix), and Kiana (Furs) to help her decorate her family's home for Halloween, while her mother is away for a week. The girls decide to take a break from decorating so that they can drink and dance. Rocky discovers a copy of a horror movie The Killer Eye, complete with a plastic replica of the titular Eye. The girls begin to watch the movie, but find it terrible and split off to do other things. Out of sight, the plastic eye comes to life. It has the same hypnotic powers as the Eye from the movie, and uses them to hypnotize Kiana into doing a striptease. When she starts to break free of her trance, the Eye kills her first.

Next, The Eye hypnotizes Jenna into making out with Catalina, but they are interrupted by Giselle (Alexander), who has crashed the party. While Jenna brings Giselle downstairs, while Catalina tries to sleep, she woke up and screamed very loud, then the eye attacks and kills her. Later, Giselle wanders into the living room and is hypnotized by the Eye. The Eye has learned how to take control of human bodies, and the hypnotized Giselle tells Rocky and Jenna that they will fall under the Eye's power and allow it to reproduce with them. Rocky attempts to destroy the Eye, but she gets killed in the process.

Jenna manages to snap Giselle out of her trance (twice), but the Eye resurrects Rocky and Catalina's dead bodies as human disguises to capture the two remaining girls. Jenna discovers a welder's mask that can block the Eye's hypnotic rays. As the Eye closes in on her, Giselle (wearing the mask) crushes the Eye with a sledgehammer to end its madness for good as well as avenging Rocky, Catalina, and Kiana's deaths. Giselle and Jenna walk over to the [[Crystal ball]] and discover something unknown.
