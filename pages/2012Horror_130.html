==Plot==
Pyrophobic mortician Gerald Tovar, Jr. inherits the family mortuary and accidentally exposes hundreds of uncremated bodies to toxic [[medical waste]]. As the corpses reanimate, Gerald’s inheritance-seeking younger brother, Harold, unexpectedly shows up and stumbles upon Gerald trying to keep the zombie outbreak under control. Sibling rivalry gives way to madness as Harold discovers Gerald’s dark secret–the freshly exhumed and zombified corpse of their father. The film also features a [[Sarah Palin]] spoof in the character of 'Sister Sara' (who works for a news outlet called 'Fixed News' which is apparently a spoof of ''[[Fox News]]'') and makes references to the original 1968 ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' film with comments such as "They're Romero zombies" and "Pittsburgh is the zombie capital."
