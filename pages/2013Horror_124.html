'''''Lights Out''''' is a 2013 Swedish [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film|horror]] [[short film]] directed, written, produced, shot, and scored by [[David F. Sandberg]] and starring [[Lotta Losten]]. The film was released online on 30 December 2013 on both [[Vimeo]] and [[YouTube]]. The short film was the basis of an [[Lights Out (2016 film)|eponymous 2016 film adaptation]], also directed by Sandberg.

== Plot ==
A woman comes out of a room and turns off the hallway light, but sees a silhouette of a woman. After turning the light off and on, the woman appears closer and she tapes the switch on to prevent her from coming back. The woman then goes into a small bedroom with only a lamp and tucks herself in, leaving the door slightly open. She then hears creaking and sees the hallway light turn off. Confused, she then hears rampant footsteps coming towards her room and hides under the blanket. She then peeks out to find the door wide open and the lamp flickering, being loose from a power strip. She then plugs it back and everything reverts. Peeking out again, she calms down but then looks around and sees [[Diana (Lights Out)|a monstrous humanoid with blank eyes and an open mouth]], which turns off the lamp.

The special effects of having the ghost appear and disappear were mostly done by using a [[Split screen (video production)|split-screen]] technique. In an interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' about [[Lights Out (2016 film)|the 2016 feature-length adaptation]], which used the same technique, Sandberg said, "Whenever she's in frame with another character, it's basically just a split screen. So you shoot it with her and without her. You turn the camera on with her, you turn it off and she walks off, and then you turn it on again. It's super simple, actually."<ref name="av club">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/lights-out-director-david-sandberg-defends-ending--240341|title=Lights Out director David Sandberg defends the ending of his horror hit|author=|date=30 July 2016|website=avclub.com|accessdate=22 July 2017}}</ref>
