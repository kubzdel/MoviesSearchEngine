==Synopsis==
Hank (Joey Bicicchi) and Doreen (Erin Breen) are madly in love and can't wait to get married. They've planned out their special day in painstaking detail, from what to wear to who to invite. Everything seems to be going well until Doreen's brother Travis (Frank Zieger) shows up with a present for his sister, a beautiful but cursed locket that causes Doreen to get possessed by the Devil. Now Travis and Hank have to drive to [[Las Vegas]] in order to find Johnny Priest (Llou Johnson) a homeless exorcist and the last known person to have successfully performed an [[exorcism]]- something made more difficult because they only have 72 hours to find Johnny and perform the exorcism before Doreen's soul is forever lost.
