'''''Whisper''''' is a 2007 [[horror film]] directed by [[Stewart Hendler]] and written by [[Christopher Borrelli]]. The film revolves around the kidnapping of a young boy, David, who is more than he appears and brings unexpected troubles for his kidnappers.

== Plot ==
After being released from prison, convicted felon Max Truemont ([[Josh Holloway]]) and his fiancée Roxanne ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]), wish to have a fresh start by running a small diner of their own. However, the bank refuses to loan $50,000 to them to open the business, and without alternatives, Max accepts the invitation of his former partner Sydney and his associate Vince to participate in the kidnapping of eight-year old David ([[Blake Woodruff]]), the son of a wealthy woman in New England, under the command of a mysterious mastermind behind the kidnapping. After the successful abduction of the boy, the group awaits ransom instructions in a secluded hideout. As they begin to become suspicious of each other, however, Max realizes the boy is not as innocent as he seems, commanding various characters to kill each other.
Ultimately, it is revealed that the mastermind is David's mother who, it turns out, had adopted him. She tells Max that the boy is a demon, able to suggest or "whisper" ideas to weak-minded individuals. She pleads with Max to kill the boy on her behalf. On Max's refusal, she kills herself with her own handgun. In the end, Max kills David, but with the loss of his fiancee Roxanne, who's killed accidentally by Max himself.
