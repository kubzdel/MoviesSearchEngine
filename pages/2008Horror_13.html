==Reception==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
''HorrorNews.net'' gave the film a mixed review, writig, "While this is not a great film by any means, if you are in the right kind of mood than it is a fun watch. And by the right kind of mood I mean if you’re ready for melodramatic acting, cheesy effects and a traditional B-movie atmosphere. If you’re not use to seeing these types of film, then I would advise to stay far away."<ref name="croft18">{{cite web|last1=Van Croft|first1=Angel|title=Film Review: Army Of The Dead (2008)|url=http://horrornews.net/18995/film-review-army-of-the-dead-2008/|website=HorrorNew.net|publisher=Angel Van Croft|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>
