'''''Asylum''''' is a 2008 American [[horror film]] that was directed by [[David R. Ellis]]. The movie was initially planned for a theatrical release but was instead released [[straight to DVD]] on July 15, 2008. ''Asylum'' stars [[Sarah Roemer]] as a young college student who must fight to survive the spirit of a mad doctor that is haunting her dorm.

== Plot ==
A college student discovers her dorm was once a notorious asylum.
According to [[Winthrop University|Winthrop's]] campus newspaper, The Johnsonian, a group of college freshmen with troubled pasts and nightmares are at Richard Miller University for orientation a couple of weeks prior to the beginning of classes.  They stumble into an old restricted area and awaken the spirit of a mad doctor, who then proceeds to torture and torment the students in the same way he tortured the patients in 1939 at Burke Asylum. During the film, first String is killed, then Maya, followed by Tommy, school's caretaker Mackey, and Ivy. All are killed by the Doctor. In the end The Doctor chases Madison and Holt through a tunnel, an abandoned factory, and the woods until Madison kills him by stabbing him in the head, causing him to lose all his power and the souls that he has taken. The movie ends with Madison and Holt walking out of the forest finally being able to have closure with their pasts.
