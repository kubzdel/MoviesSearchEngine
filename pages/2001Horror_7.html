'''''Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre''''' ({{lang-fr|Belphégor – Le fantôme du Louvre}}) is a 2001 French [[fantasy film]] directed by [[Jean-Paul Salomé]] and starring [[Sophie Marceau]], [[Michel Serrault]], [[Frédéric Diefenthal]], and [[Julie Christie]].<ref name="imdb">{{cite web|title=Belphégor – Le fantôme du Louvre |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214529/ |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> Written by Salomé, [[Danièle Thompson]], and Jérôme Tonnerre, the film is about a mummy's spirit that possesses a woman (Sophie Marceau) in the Paris museum. Loosely based on the 1927 horror novel ''[[Belphégor (novel)|Belphégor]]'' by [[Arthur Bernède]], this film is the third dramatized adaptation, following the first film in 1927, and a TV [[miniseries]] in 1965. ''Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre'' was filmed on location at the [[Musée du Louvre]], the first feature film to be shot in part inside the world-famous museum.<ref name="allmovie">{{cite web|last=Deming |first=Mark |title=Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre |publisher=''Allmovie'' |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v244088 |accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref>

==Plot==
A rare collection of artifacts from an archeological dig in Egypt are brought to the famous [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris. While experts are using a laser scanning device to determine the age of a sarcophagus, a spirit escapes and makes its way into the museum's electrical system. Museum curator Faussier ([[Jean-Francois Balmer]]) brings in noted Egyptologist, Glenda Spencer ([[Julie Christie]]), to examine the findings, and she announces that the mummy inside the coffin was actually the evil spirit [[Belphegor]].

Meanwhile, Lisa ([[Sophie Marceau]]), a young woman who lives across the street from the museum, follows her runaway cat into the Louvre after closing time. She accidentally receives an electrical shock that transfers the stray spirit into her body. Soon Lisa is disguising herself as Belphegor and making off with the rare Egyptian treasures on display at the museum, convinced that they are rightfully hers. When Belphegor proves more than a match for the Louvre's security forces, renowned detective Verlac ([[Michel Serrault]]) is brought out of retirement to find out why the museum's Egyptian collection has been shrinking.
