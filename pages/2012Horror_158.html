'''''Resolution''''' is a 2012 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Justin Benson (director)|Justin Benson]] and [[Aaron Scott Moorhead]], written by Benson, and starring Peter Cilella and Vinny Curran.  Cilella plays a professional from the city who goes back to his hometown to save his junkie friend, played by Curran.

== Plot ==
Michael Danube, a professional graphic designer who lives in the city with his wife, receives an email that contains a video of Chris Daniels, his former best friend.  Chris has become a junkie, retreated to [[Boondocks|a remote rural area]], and his behavior is delusional and erratic.  A map is included with the video.  Despite the objections of his wife, Michael decides to make one last attempt to save his friend from drug addiction.  Michael promises to return after one week and follows the map to a run-down house, where he hears Chris ranting and shooting a pistol.  Michael cautiously approaches the house and announces himself.  Chris reacts positively and invites him in, ranting about various subjects.  Michael tries to convince Chris to go to rehab, but Chris refuses.  Michael uses a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] to stun Chris and handcuffs him to a pipe.  When Michael returns from a shopping trip, he sees Chris trying to cut through his handcuff with a toothbrush.  In the morning, Michael uses the stun gun again to stave off an attempted attack by Chris.

Later, Micah and Billy show up and tell Michael that Chris is holding their drugs, which they want back.  Chris warns Michael not to mess with them, as they have become more violent and unpredictable since Michael last knew them.  Michael takes a walk and meets members of a [[UFO religion]], then returns to the house and finds a set of strange photographs.  Micah and Billy return, but they are scared off by Charles, a [[Indian tribal police|tribal security]] guard who tells Michael that Chris is [[squatting]] on [[Indian reservation|reservation land]].  Michael bribes him to allow them to stay there for five days.  Michael then finds creepy film footage, and Chris tells Michael that he never sent any emails or videos.  Michael finds a book full of creepy campfire stories on their doorstep, and, when he returns the book to the library, finds film slides.  Confused by the items that seem purposefully left for them to find, Michael suggests that it's a prank by Billy and Micah, but Chris dismisses the idea as irrelevant.

Michael continues to find conspicuous clues strewn about the area.  When he bribes Charles for information, Charles warns him off and tells him that French students used the area for research.  They encounter a con man who offers to buy the house, but he leaves after Michael reveals that they are only renting.  When Michael rewatches the video  he received in the e-mail, the video has changed: it now shows an argument that Michael and Chris just had moments before, over whether they should have made a deal with the con man.  When Billy and Micah return, they kill the dog that Chris has adopted, and Chris reveals that he is suicidal.  Michael tracks down the dog's original owner, an archeologist named Byron who was a member of the original French research team at the site.  Byron believes the area is not haunted; instead, something there desires stories.  Byron stresses the need for a beginning, middle, and end.  Alarmed by Byron's eccentricity, Michael leaves and returns to the house.

As more ostentatious clues suddenly appear from nowhere, the film projector Michael has been using to watch some of the found film footage now reveals the gruesome death and funeral photos of Michael and Chris. Michael's laptop suddenly plays a video that depicts their own violent deaths at the hands of Micah and Billy.  Confused and scared, they flee the house, only to find a compact disc that has a recording of Charles murdering them and burning down the house.  Chris insists that they leave the property immediately, but Michael does not want to bring the curse home with him; instead, he wants to attempt to appease the entity.  When Chris and Michael return to the house, they witness Charles murdering Micah and Billy before setting the house on fire.  Chris and Michael panic after witnessing the murder of their counterparts, with Chris breaking down and finally agreeing to go to drug rehab. Their joy over achieving a happy ending to their story is abruptly cut short when the entity angrily confronts them; Chris apologizes profusely, and Michael asks the entity, "Can we try it another way?" The only reply he gets is an explosive roar from the creature as the camera cuts to black.

== Production ==
Although the film is often described as "genre-bending", this was not an intentional concept; it was always meant as a horror film about an unseen antagonist that manipulates reality to create interesting stories.  The detox plotline was introduced to give the story more structure, as the directors needed a plot device to have the story unfold over seven days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/64630|title=AICN HORROR talks with Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead, the directors of RESOLUTION!

The main parts of the film were shot in 17 days, but the side plots were shot over the course of several months on weekends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/exclusive-directors-justin-benson-and-aaron-moorhead-their-genre-bending-feature-film|title=Exclusive: Directors Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead on Their Genre-Bending Feature Film Debut 'Resolution'|last=Wixson|first=Heather|work=[[Fearnet]]|date=2013-01-21|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  The directors were specifically interested in avoiding overt homage, and, instead, focused on parodying [[independent film]] tropes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/04/tribeca-2012-interview-justin-benson-and-aaron-scott-moorhead-of-resolution.html|title=Tribeca 2012 Interview: Justin Benson and Aaron Scott Moorhead of RESOLUTION|last=Gutierrez|first=Peter|work=[[Twitch Film]]|date=2012-04-26|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  The film was shot in [[East County, San Diego]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/meet-the-2012-tribeca-filmmakers-10-resolution-story-directors-justin-benson-aaron-moorhead|title=Meet the 2012 Tribeca Filmmakers #10: 'Resolution' Directors Justin Benson & Aaron Moorhead|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=2012-04-07|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  The directors have no direct experience with detox; to perform research, they searched Google for information.

Many reviews compared it to ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''.  ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' rated it 3.5/5 stars and described it as "clever, creepy meta-horror" that is like a lo-fi version of ''The Cabin in the Woods''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/2013/06/21/resolution-review/|title=Resolution REVIEW|work=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]|date=2013-06-21|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  Kurt Halfyard of [[Twitch Film]] wrote, "Unlike the smug, offhand silliness of Joss Whedon and Drew Stoddard's ''Cabin in the Woods'', this one makes you give a damn; as much about the films building ''Lost''-type puzzlebox, but moreso the two exceptionally well realized characters."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2012/07/fantasia-2012-resolution-review.html|title=Fantasia 2012 Review: RESOLUTION|last=Halfyard|first=Kurt|work=[[Twitch Film]]|date=2012-07-26|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  Scott Weinberg of [[Fearnet]] called the film "a smart and subversive take" that is less entertaining than ''Cabin in the Woods''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fearnet-movie-review-resolution|title=FEARnet Movie Review: 'Resolution'|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[Fearnet]]|date=2012-08-29|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  Nick Schager of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote that it puts ''Cabin the Woods'' "to shame on a fraction of the budget".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-01-23/film/resolution-film-review/|title=Resolution: Twisty Meta-Horror Done Right|last=Schager|first=Nick|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=2013-01-23|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  Ian Buckwalter of [[NPR]] wrote, "''Resolution'' is really a less self-conscious cousin to last year's ''Cabin in the Woods''; both are hugely satisfying exercises in examining the way in which stories are told."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/24/170098925/resolution-another-cabin-a-very-different-show?ft=1&f=1045|title='Resolution': Another Cabin, A Very Different Show|last=Buckwalter|first=Ian|work=[[NPR]]|date=2013-01-24|accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref>  Scott Tobias of [[The A.V.
