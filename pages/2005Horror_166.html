'''''Snuff-Movie''''' is a 2005 gothic horror film by British director [[Bernard Rose (director)|Bernard Rose]]. It stars [[Jeroen Krabbé]] as a horror film maker named Boris Arkadin, whose pregnant wife, Mary, was brutally murdered by a [[Charles Manson|Manson]]-like gang of hippy psychopaths during the 1960s...or was she? An eccentric recluse, Boris makes a comeback when he invites some actors to a large mansion in the English countryside to 'audition' for his new film. But unknown to most of them they are being filmed by hidden cameras linked to a '[[Snuff film|snuff]]' website.
