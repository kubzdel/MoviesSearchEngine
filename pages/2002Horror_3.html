'''''28 Days Later''''' is a 2002 British [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Danny Boyle]], written by [[Alex Garland]], and starring [[Cillian Murphy]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Megan Burns]], and [[Christopher Eccleston]]. The plot depicts the breakdown of society following the accidental release of a highly contagious virus and focuses upon the struggle of four survivors to cope with the destruction of the life they once knew.

Successful both commercially and critically, the film is credited with reinvigorating the [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] genre of horror film.<ref name="Bloody-Disgusting" /> The film spawned a 2007 sequel, ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'', a graphic novel titled ''[[28 Days Later: The Aftermath]]'', which expands on the timeline of the outbreak, and a 2009 comic book series titled ''[[28 Days Later (comics)|28 Days Later]]''. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine  ranked it the 97th best British film ever.<ref>[https://www.timeout.com/london/film/100-best-british-films#tab_panel_4 "The 100 best British films"]. ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]''. Retrieved 24 October 2017</ref>

== Plot ==
In [[Cambridge]], three animal liberation activists break into a medical research laboratory. A scientist in the lab desperately warns them against releasing the captive chimpanzees, which are infected with a highly contagious rage-inducing virus. Ignoring his pleas, the activists release a chimp, which infects a female activist. She then attacks and infects everyone else present.

28 days later, in [[London]], Jim, a bicycle courier, awakens from a coma in [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. He finds the entire hospital deserted. He wanders the streets of London, finding it deserted as well, with signs of catastrophe everywhere. Jim enters a church where a mass suicide has taken place, aside from two infected who are alerted by him saying "Hello?" He then finds a priest, who turns out to be infected. Jim flees, attracting attention of more infected, but survivors Selena and Mark rescue him. At their shelter, they explain to Jim that while he was in a coma, a virus had spread quickly among the populace, resulting in [[societal collapse]]. They claim the virus had been reported in [[Paris]] and [[New York City]] as well, suggesting the infection has spread worldwide.

The next day, Selena and Mark accompany Jim to his parents' house in Deptford, where he discovers they committed suicide in bed together. That night, the three are attacked by more infected. Mark is bitten, and Selena kills him. She curtly explains that the virus spreads through blood and saliva and overwhelms its victims in 10 to 20 seconds. She warns that should Jim become infected, she will kill him "in a heartbeat". The two see some blinking [[Christmas]] lights from [[Balfron Tower]] and head there. They discover two more survivors – cab driver Frank and his daughter Hannah – who allow them to take shelter. The next day, Frank informs them that their supplies – particularly water – are dwindling. He plays them a pre-recorded radio broadcast from a military blockade near [[Manchester]], claiming they have "the answer to infection" and promises to protect any survivors who reach them.

The group board Frank's cab and head to Manchester, bonding with one another during the trip. At the deserted blockade, Frank is infected when a drop of blood falls into his eye. He is killed by the arriving soldiers, who take the remaining survivors to a fortified mansion under the command of Major Henry West. West reveals to Jim that his "answer to infection" entails waiting for the infected to starve to death and luring female survivors into sexual slavery to repopulate the world. The group attempts to flee, but Jim is captured and chained next to Sergeant Farrell, a dissenting soldier. Farrell shares with Jim his speculation that the virus has not spread beyond [[Great Britain]] and that the country is being quarantined.

The next day, the soldiers prepare the girls for gang rape, while two soldiers lead Jim and Farrell to execution. When his executioners argue after killing Farrell, Jim escapes. Jim lures West and another soldier to the blockade, where Jim kills the latter and leaves West stranded for arriving infected. He runs back to the mansion and releases Mailer, an infected soldier West kept for observation. Mailer quickly spreads the infection among the soldiers in the mansion. In the confusion, Corporal Mitchell drags Selena upstairs to rape her, but Jim interrupts and kills him. The two reunite with Hannah and run to Frank's cab. Jim is shot by West, who has been waiting inside the cab. Mailer grabs West through the rear window of the cab and kills him. The trio finally leave the mansion.

Another 28 days later, Jim is recovering at a remote cottage. Downstairs, he finds Selena sewing large swaths of fabric when Hannah appears. The three rush outside and unfurl a huge cloth banner, adding the final letter to the word "HELLO" laid out on the meadow. A lone fighter jet flies over the three survivors, the infected are shown dying of starvation, and the pilot calls in a rescue helicopter.

== Alternative endings ==
The DVD extras include three alternative endings, all of which conclude with Jim dying. Two were filmed, while the third, a more radical departure, was presented only in storyboards. On 25 July 2003, cinemas started showing the alternative ending after the film's credits.<ref name="PlottingAlternativeEndings">{{cite web |accessdate=2 February 2008 |work=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3153077.stm |title=Plotting alternative film endings |date=15 August 2003}}</ref>

=== Jim dies at the hospital ===
In this ending, after Jim is shot, Selena and Hannah still rush him to the deserted hospital, but the scene is extended. Selena, with Hannah's assistance, attempts to perform life-saving procedures but cannot revive Jim. Selena is heartbroken and Hannah, distraught, looks to her for guidance. Selena tells Hannah they will go on; they pick up their guns and walk away from Jim's lifeless body. Selena and Hannah, still dressed in ballgowns and fully armed, leave the hospital.

On the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland explain that this was the original ending of the film's first cut, which was tested with preview audiences. It was rejected for seeming too bleak; the final exit from the hospital was intended to imply Selena and Hannah's survival, whereas test audiences felt the women were marching off to certain death. Boyle and Garland express a preference for this alternative ending, calling it the "true ending". They comment that this ending brought Jim full circle, as he starts and finishes the story in bed in a deserted hospital. This ending was added in the theatrical release of the film beginning on 25 July 2003, placed after the credits and prefaced with the words, "what if..."<ref name="PlottingAlternativeEndings" />

==== "Hospital Dream" ====
The "Hospital Dream" ending is an extended version of the theatrical alternative ending, wherein Jim dies at the hospital. In the optional commentary the director states that this was the full version of the original ending.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Jim dreams while unconscious and remembers the final moments on his bicycle before the crash. The footage cuts back and forth between the scene with Selena and Hannah trying to save his life, and the dream sequence. As he gets hit by a car in his flashback, he simultaneously dies on the operating table.

==== Rescue coda without Jim ====
This ending, for which only a rough edit was completed, is an alternative version of the potential rescue sequence shown at the very end of the released film. Here, the scenes are identical, except that this ending was intended to be placed after the first alternative ending wherein Jim dies, so he is absent. When Selena is sewing one of the banner letters in the cottage, she is seen facetiously talking to a chicken instead of Jim. Only Selena and Hannah are seen waving to the jet flying overhead in the final shots.

=== "Radical Alternative Ending" ===
The "Radical Alternative Ending", rather than a bare ending, is a radically different development of the film from the midpoint; it was not filmed and is presented on the DVD as a series of illustrated [[storyboards]] with voiceovers by Boyle and Garland. When Frank is infected at the military blockade near Manchester, the soldiers do not enter the story. Instead, Jim, Selena, and Hannah are somehow able to restrain Frank, hoping they will find a cure for the virus nearby as suggested in the radio broadcast. They soon discover that the blockade had protected a large medical research complex, the same one featured in the first scene of the film where the virus was developed. Inside, the party is relieved to find a scientist barricaded inside a room with food and water. He will not open the door because he fears they will take his food, although he does admit that the "answer to infection is here". Unfortunately, he refuses to talk further because he does not want to create an emotional attachment to people who will soon be dead. After hours of failed attempts to break through the door or coax the man out, Jim eventually brings Hannah to the door and explains Frank's situation.

The scientist reluctantly tells them Frank can only be cured with a complete blood transfusion and supplies them with the equipment. After learning that he is the only match with Frank's blood type, Jim sacrifices himself so Frank can survive with his daughter. Just as his journey began, Jim is left alone in the abandoned medical facility, and Selena, Hannah and Frank move into the room with the scientist, as a horde of the infected breaches the complex. The computer monitors show death and destruction come to life around a thrashing, infected Jim, who is strapped to the same table as the chimp had been in the opening scene. Garland and Boyle explain that they conceived this ending to see what the film would be like if they did not expand the focus beyond the four survivors. They decided against it because the idea of a total blood replacement as a cure was not credible. Boyle said in the DVD commentary that it "didn't make much sense", since the film had already established that one drop of blood can infect a person. "What would we do? Drain him of blood and scrub his veins with bleach?"

== Cast ==

* [[Naomie Harris]] as Selena
* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Frank
* [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Major Henry West
* [[Megan Burns]] as Hannah

On the DVD commentary, Boyle explains that, with the aim of preserving the suspension of disbelief, relatively unknown actors were cast in the film. Cillian Murphy had starred primarily in small independent films, while Naomie Harris had acted on British television as a child, and Megan Burns had only one previous film credit. However, Christopher Eccleston and Brendan Gleeson were well-known [[character actor]]s.

== Production ==
After director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald filmed an adaptation of Alex Garland's novel ''[[The Beach (novel)|The Beach]]'', Garland approached Macdonald about his concept for ''28 Days Later.'' In an interview with ''Creative Screenwriting'', Garland explained, "I said to him that I had an idea for a movie about running zombies. I wrote it and sent it to him and the two of us went backwards and forwards with it for a few drafts... At the point I was working on ''28 Days Later'' I had a lot of zombie movies as well as video games like ''Resident Evil'' turning round in my head."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/alex-garland-on-screenwriting/|title=Alex Garland on Screenwriting|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=6 January 2016|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=6 January 2016}}</ref>

''28 Days Later'' features scenes set in normally bustling parts of London such as [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Horse Guards Parade]] and [[Oxford Street]]. To depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays and would have typically around 45 minutes after dawn, to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public – to minimise disruption. Portions of the film were shot on a [[List of Canon camcorders#Canon XL-1/XL-1s|Canon XL1]] [[digital video]] camera.<ref>{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Bankston |url=http://www.theasc.com/magazine/july03/sub/index.html |title=Anthony Dod Mantle, DFF injects the apocalyptic 28 Days Later with a strain of digital video |work=TheASC.com |date=1 July 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2007}}</ref> DV cameras are much smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras, which would have been impractical on such brief shoots. The scenes of the [[M1 motorway]] devoid of traffic were also filmed within very limited time periods. A mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently, to leave a long section of carriageway empty while the scene was filmed. The section depicted in the film was filmed at [[Milton Keynes]], nowhere near Manchester.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For the London scene where Jim walks by the overturned double-decker bus, the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished, all within 20 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Much of the filming took place prior to the [[11 September attacks]] and in the audio commentary, Boyle notes the parallel between the "missing persons" flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks. Boyle adds that his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off [[Whitehall]] for filming after the terrorist attacks in New York. A clapperboard seen in one of the DVD extra features shows filming was still taking place on 8 October 2001.

The mansion used in the film was [[Trafalgar House (Wiltshire)|Trafalgar Park]] near [[Salisbury]]. Many rooms in the house, including the [[Giovanni Battista Cipriani|Cipriani]]-painted music room and the main hall, were filmed with minimal set decoration. The scenes occurring upstairs were filmed downstairs, as the mansion's owner resided upstairs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The old ruins used as the setting for an idyllic interlude in their journey to Manchester, were those of [[Waverley Abbey]], [[Surrey]]. The end scenes of the film where Jim, Selena and Hannah are living in a rural cottage were filmed around [[Ennerdale Water|Ennerdale]] in [[Cumbria]].<ref name="Cumbria">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/content/articles/2006/03/31/cumbriaonfilm_others_feature.shtml |title=Cumbria live |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> This reflects the motorway road signage in the film which indicates the trio heading north towards the [[Lake District|Lake District National Park]].

On the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland frequently call it a [[post apocalyptic|post apocalypse]] and [[horror film]], commenting on scenes that were quotation of [[George A. Romero]]'s [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|Dead trilogy]]. During the initial marketing of the film Boyle did try to distance the film from such labels. Boyle identified [[John Wyndham (writer)|John Wyndham]]'s ''[[The Day of the Triffids]]'' as Garland's original inspiration for the story.<ref name="Guardian2">{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,2073292,00.html |title=A capital place for panic attacks |accessdate=12 May 2007 |work=Guardian News and Media Limited |author=Kermode, Mark |location=London |date=6 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513170940/http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0%2C%2C2073292%2C00.html |archivedate=13 May 2007 |deadurl=no }}</ref>
