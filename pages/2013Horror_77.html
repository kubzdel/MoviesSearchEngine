'''''Escape from Tomorrow''''' is a 2013 American [[independent film|independent]] [[horror film]] written and directed by Randy Moore in his directorial debut. It tells the story of an unemployed father having increasingly bizarre experiences and disturbing visions on the last day of a family vacation at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. It premiered in January at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]] and was later a personal selection of [[Roger Ebert]], shown at his 15th annual film festival in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. The film was a 2012 official selection of the [[PollyGrind Film Festival]], but at the time filmmakers were still working on some legal issues and asked that it not be screened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/blogs/surviving-cinema/v-victory |title=Chiller &#124; Scary Good |publisher=Fearnet.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-16}}</ref>

The film drew attention due to the fact that Moore had shot most of it on location at both Walt Disney World and [[Disneyland]] without permission from [[The Walt Disney Company]], owner and operator of both parks. Due to Disney's reputation of being protective of its [[intellectual property]], the cast and crew used [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques to avoid attracting attention, such as keeping their scripts on their [[iPhone]]s and shooting on handheld video cameras similar to those used by park visitors.<ref name="LA Times story">{{cite news|last=Zeitchik|first=Steven|title=Sundance 2013: How did a newbie make an unapproved film in Disney parks?|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-sundance-2013-escape-from-tomorrow-disneyland-randy-moore-release-20130118,0,4296.story|newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref> After [[principal photography]] was complete, Moore was so determined to keep the project a secret from Disney that he edited it in South Korea. Sundance similarly declined to discuss the film in detail before it was shown.

==Plot==
A montage shows visitors on the rides at [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the many visuals and [[animatronics]] that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]. On the last day of a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.

The chance encounter with the girls piques Jim's interest, and he makes subtle efforts to pursue them unbeknownst to the rest of his family. He has disturbing hallucinations during the rides, such as the evil faces of [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] characters and his family verbally abusing him. After fighting with his wife Emily, Jim decides not to take his son Elliot to [[Space Mountain]] (which gives Elliot [[motion sickness]]) in order to keep chasing after the French girls. He then takes his daughter Sara to the [[Magic Kingdom]] so he can stalk Isabelle and Sophie while Emily and Elliot return to the hotel. Later, the son of a wheelchair-bound man, whom Jim spotted earlier, shoves Sara, who scrapes her knee. Jim takes her to the park nurse to have Sara's knee treated. Jim and Sara meet a mysterious woman with a glimmering amulet necklace which hypnotizes Jim. He blacks out and regains consciousness mid-coitus with the woman in her room. Afterwards, she claims that the parks' wholesome, costumed princesses are actually part of a secret prostitution ring that services rich Asian businessmen. Increasingly unnerved, Jim and Sara join his wife and son at the pool, where Jim sees the French girls. He swims closer to converse with them, but Emily sees and berates him.

His family returns to [[Epcot]], where the tension between Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros|Gran Fiesta Tour]]. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious interest in them and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the [[Soarin' Over California|Soarin']] attraction at Epcot, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come with them. When Jim refuses, Sophie spits on his face and she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a [[taser]] to knock him unconscious.

Jim awakes in a secret detention facility under Epcot's Spaceship Earth, where he sees video screens displaying pictures of the woman he imagined on the Soarin' ride and other images of events that happened earlier. A scientist enters and activates a Spaceship Earth resembling helmet, which covers Jim's head and scans him while images of what the scientist refers to as "the real Jim" appear on the screens, being himself dressed differently and apparently part of another family. The scientist discusses Jim's flights of fantasy and imagination and reveals that he is part of the experiment by the [[Siemens]] Corporation ever since he first went to the theme park as a child with his father. His boss is in on the conspiracy and his firing was all part of the plan, and so was the closure of the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear ride]] just as he and Elliot approached the boarding area, much to Elliot's distress. The scientist also tells Jim that he had turned in Elliot to them, like Jim's father had done to him as a child.

After damaging the instrument panel with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who turns out to be an [[android (robot)|android]], Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and [[hairballs]], which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.

The next morning, Emily finds Jim's corpse, which now has cat eyes and a grinning face. Disney cleaning staff arrive to remove proof of death and fill Elliot's head with false memories of riding the Buzz Lightyear attraction. They take Jim's body to the unmarked white van from the opening. Meanwhile, the valet from the video screens greets the "real Jim", accompanied by the fantasy woman and a young girl, before they check into the hotel as the valet watches the van drive away.

==Background==
Moore, a native of [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]],<ref name="Sundance page">{{cite web|title=Escape From Tomorrow|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13030/escape_from_tomorrow|publisher=[[Sundance Film Festival]]|year=2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> frequently visited his father in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] following his parents' divorce. The two often spent time together at [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] nearby. "It was a special, physical place, and it became an emotional space," he told ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]].'' He added: "Obviously, I have a lot of father issues that I can't separate from that place."<ref name="Filmmaker article">{{cite web|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|title=The Outlaw Pleasures of ''Escape from Tomorrow''|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/63499-the-outlaw-pleasures-of-escape-from-tomorrow/|publisher=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> Later, their relationship deteriorated.<ref name="IndieWire interview">{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Sundance 2013: 'Escape From Tomorrow' Director Randy Moore Says "I'm a Product of Disney World"|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-interview-escape-from-tomorrow-director-randy-moore-says-im-a-product-of-disney-world|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|date=January 27, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2013}}</ref>

He decided to pursue a career in film. After attending two other film schools, he graduated from [[Full Sail University]] in another [[Central Florida]] town, [[Winter Park, Florida|Winter Park]], as the class [[valedictorian]]. He moved to [[Southern California]] and began working as a [[story editor]], primarily doing uncredited rewrites.<ref name="Sundance page" />

In Hollywood, he married and started a family. Much like his own father, he frequently took his own children to [[Disneyland]]. "It wasn't until our first family trip together that this very visceral emotional landscape of my past, that I had by now nearly all but forgotten, hit me again like [a] bullet."<ref name="Filmmaker five questions">{{cite web|last=Schoenbrun|first=Dan|title=Five Questions with ''Escape from Tomorrow'' Director Randy Moore|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/63249-five-questions-with-escape-from-tomorrow-director-randy-moore/|publisher=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|date=January 19, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> On the family's first trip to Walt Disney World, the emotions grew stronger. "[I]t was like he was there as a ghost. We were going on the same rides I used to go on with him, but now we're no longer talking anymore."<ref name="IndieWire interview" />

His wife, a native of the [[former Soviet Union]] who had no memories or expectations like his, saw things with fresh eyes. Moore said "She's a nurse and goes between floors at hospitals. At one point she turned to me at some princess fair or something and said, 'This is worse than working the psych [ward] at the hospital.'"<ref name="IndieWire interview" />

He read [[Neal Gabler]]'s biography of [[Walt Disney]] and took the children to Disneyland more frequently.<ref name="IndieWire interview" /> "I became obsessed with finding a connection," he recalled later.<ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /> He wrote the screenplay for ''Escape from Tomorrow'' in a month along with two others.<ref name="IndieWire interview" /> An inheritance from his grandparents provided the bulk of the film's budget,<ref name="LA Times story" /> which he put at around $650,000, triple what he had originally planned.<ref name="IndieWire interview" />

"There was nowhere else to do it," Moore says of his decision to use Disney World as a setting and shoot at the parks. Disney, which has a reputation for aggressively protecting its [[intellectual property]], has been tolerant of visitors uploading videos of their visits to [[YouTube]] and elsewhere since most of those user-created videos project a positive image of the parks. But Moore did not expect to get permission from Disney to shoot there given his negative, [[surrealistic]] portrayal of the park.<ref name="NY Times article">{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=It's a Grim World, After All|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/movies/escape-from-tomorrow-at-sundance-scrutinizes-disney.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 21, 2013}}</ref>

Instead he used [[guerrilla filmmaking]] techniques, which sometimes call for using locations without getting permission. ''Escape from Tomorrow'' is not the first film made in whole, or part, this way at the Disney parks. In 2010, the British [[street art]]ist [[Banksy]] shot a scene for ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'' in one of the parks with his collaborator [[Mr. Brainwash]]. They managed to smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a [[viral video|viral]] [[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] short, ''Missing in the Mansion'',<ref name="Missing in the Mansion">{{cite web|title=Missing in the Mansion|url=http://www.missinginthemansion.com/|publisher=Daws Brothers Studios|year=2011|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> filmed in [[the Haunted Mansion]], was distributed online without interference from Disney.<ref name="/Film post">{{cite web|last=Sciretta|first=Peter|title='Escape From Tomorrow': A Feature Film Shot in Disney Theme Parks Without Disney's Permission [Sundance 2013 Review]|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/escape-from-tomorrow-a-feature-film-shot-in-disney-theme-parks-without-disneys-permission-sundance-2013-review/|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref>

Extensive pre-production was necessary. The unique nature of the film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking, such as charting the position of the sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment. Scenes were rehearsed and [[Blocking (stage)|blocked]] in hotel rooms, rather than the actual locations.<ref name="/Film post" /> "We must have walked through the entire movie at least eight or nine times during multiple scouting trips before we ever rolled camera," Moore says.<ref name="Filmmaker five questions" />

Before [[principal photography]], the cast and crew bought season passes to both the Disneyland and Walt Disney World resorts. They spent ten days in Florida, then returned to California for two weeks at Disneyland, making the parks depicted in the film a combination of both resorts.<ref name="/Film post" /> Actors and crew entered the parks in small groups to avoid attracting attention.<ref name="NY Times article" /> "At one point, I even made the camera department shave off their facial hair and dress in tourist attire, which almost provoked a mutiny," says Moore.<ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /> Despite the actors wearing the same clothes for days on end, Moore told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', park personnel never appeared to notice them,<ref name="LA Times story" /> save for one day near the end of filming when Disneyland security thought they were [[paparazzi]] harassing a celebrity family.<ref name="/Film post" />
[[File:Canon EOS 5D Mark II with 50mm 1.4 edit1.jpg|left|thumb|A Canon EOS 5D Mark II|alt=A black camera with a short lens barrel and large hand grip on the left. "Canon" is visible above the lens, and "EOS 5D" on the right.]]
The film was shot using the video mode of two [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and one [[Canon EOS 1D Mark IV]] [[digital single-lens reflex]] cameras, which helped the filmmakers look more like typical park visitors.<ref name="/Film post" /> To compensate for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in [[monochrome]] mode. "[W]e were shooting with really [[Lens speed#Fast lenses|fast lenses]] wide open, so our [[depth of field]] was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a [[focus puller]]," Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. "[B]ecause the 5D doesn't shoot [[Uncompressed video|RAW]], we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, even if we had wanted to."<ref name="Filmmaker five questions" /> Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.<ref name="/Film post" />

Actors and crew used their [[iPhone]]s to communicate and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones.<ref name="LA Times story" /> The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day.<ref name="/Film post" /> For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking only three or four takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.<ref name="Filmmaker five questions" />

She is looking at him while he appears to grimace]] Scenes involved riding on eight recognizable attractions in the parks. One required waiting in a long line for the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear]] ride at Disneyland, and the actors rode [[It's a Small World]] at least 12 times to get the scene right. "I was surprised the ride operators weren't a little more savvy," Moore told ''[[The New York Times]]''. For a scene where two characters pass on the People Mover, Moore had the actors ride it for hours while he worked out the timing.<ref name="NY Times article" />

After the location filming, production went back to [[soundstage]]s for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a [[Chroma key|green screen]] background for [[second unit]] footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of [[crane shot]]s.<ref name="Filmmaker article" /> With the photography done, Moore took the film to [[South Korea]] to [[film editing|edit]] to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing.<ref name="LA Times story" /> [[Visual effects]] were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, ''[[The Host (2006 film)|The Host]]''.<ref name="/Film post" />

The post-production tasks were as challenging as the production itself. [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|Sound editors]] had to listen to the entire uncut tracks from the recorders taped to the actors' bodies in order to find the dialogue. Content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to "[[It's a small world (after all)|It's a Small World]]" and footage from [[Soarin' Over California#Epcot|Soarin']], was removed from the film to avoid [[Copyright infringement of audio-visual works|copyright infringement]].<ref name="/Film post" /> Composer [[Abel Korzeniowski]] contributed a light, airy score similar to those used in [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's Golden Age]].<ref name="LA Times story" />

==Sundance==
Moore submitted the completed film to the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where many independent films seek distributors. He had little hope that it would be accepted due to the festival's corporate sponsors. But Trevor Groth, the festival's new director of programming, was "blown away" by ''Escape from Tomorrow'', and accepted it for the festival's non-competitive "Next" category, for films that transcend the limitations of the low budgets common to most independent films.<ref name="LA Times story" />

When the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival|2013 festival]] began in [[Park City, Utah]], the secrecy about the movie continued. The festival's website only identified the setting as a theme park.<ref name="Sundance page" /> Nan Chalat-Noaker, critic for the ''[[Park Record]]'', recalls that the festival and even the film's publicist were unwilling to share further details about the film, but strongly urged critics to see it. In her review, she declined to identify the setting of the film by name, although she dropped broad hints, out of fear it would alert Disney's lawyers. The premiere, on the festival's first night, was not fully attended; when word got out to the attendees, all the other shows were effectively sold out.<ref name="Park Record review">{{cite news|last=Chalat-Noaker |first=Nan |title="Escape" takes audience on horror-filled roller coaster ride |url=http://www.parkrecord.com/ci_22409760/escape-takes-audience-horror-filled-roller-coaster-ride |newspaper=[[Park Record]] |location=[[Park City, Utah|Park City, UT]] |publisher=[[MediaNews Group]] |date=January 19, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410142249/http://www.parkrecord.com/ci_22409760/escape-takes-audience-horror-filled-roller-coaster-ride |archivedate=April 10, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

==Reception==
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 80 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "Conceptually audacious but only intermittently successful in execution, ''Escape From Tomorrow'' is nonetheless visually inventive and darkly surreal."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/escape_from_tomorrow_2013/ |title = Escape From Tomorrow (2013) |work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = February 7, 2014}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 58 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/escape-from-tomorrow |title=Escape from Tomorrow reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref>

Before the [[Martin Luther King Day]] weekend was over, ''Escape from Tomorrow'' was being widely discussed by festival attendees. ''The New York Times'' and the ''Los Angeles Times'' both ran articles about the film and Moore. Much of the attention focused on the audacity of the filmmaking. [[Movies.com]] reported that people were already calling it "the ultimate guerrilla film".<ref name="Movies.com post" /> On the night of the premiere, [[Drew McWeeny]] wrote:

It simply cannot be true.

I grew up in Florida, and I have been going to Walt Disney World my entire life. I worked at that park. I've been there as a child, as a teenager, as an employee, and as a parent. I've done Disney sitting on my father's shoulders, and I've done the Disney parks with my kids sitting on my shoulders.

Even so," he concluded, "there is a sort of naive charm that makes it impossible to look away."<ref name="McWeeny review" />

Other critics concurred that the film had artistic merit. "[W]atching Moore's noir tale is like being super-glued to your seat while getting poked in the eye," Chalat-Noaker wrote. "It's both fascinating and repelling."<ref name="Park Record review" /> Stephen Zeitchik of the ''Los Angeles Times'' called it "one of the strangest and most provocative movies this reporter has seen in eight years attending the Sundance Film Festival".<ref name="LA Times story" /> At [[Indiewire]], Eric Kohn wrote that "Moore portrays Disney World as the ultimate horror show {{ndash}} and gets the point across in nearly every scene".<ref name="IndieWire review">{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Sundance Review: 'Escape From Tomorrow' Is a Surreal Indictment of Disneyfied Society That Disney Will Never Let You See|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/sundance-review-escape-from-tomorrow-is-a-surreal-indictment-of-disneyfied-society-that-disney-will-never-let-you-see|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|date=January 18, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref> 
While they conceded the film's audacious production made it worth their time to watch, other critics found flaws. "It's not a great film. The story has some good ideas, but the execution is uneven," wrote Peter Sciretta at [[/Film]], while still recommending it as "unlike anything you've seen before [or will] see again".<ref name="/Film post" /> Similarly, [[CraveOnline]]'s William Bibbiani "wouldn't have missed it for the world" but qualified it by noting that the film often lacked "cohesion and clarity".<ref name="CraveOnline review">{{cite web|last=Bibbiani|first=William|title=Sundance 2013 Review: Escape from Tomorrow|url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/reviews/203497-sundance-2013-review-escape-from-tomorrow|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

[[Kyle Smith]] of the ''[[New York Post]]'' had the most negative assessment, calling it "more fun to discuss than to sit through". While he found the guerilla filmmaking aspect of it "intriguing", all it amounted to for him was "a couple of amusingly surreal moments" that could have taken place at any sufficiently large amusement park: "Even Disney-hating hipsters are going to be disappointed; the film is a pure festival play that is more or less unreleasable unless theater owners start selling [[marijuana|weed]] along with popcorn."<ref name="NY Post review">{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Kyle |authorlink=Kyle Smith |title=Sundance review: 'Escape from Tomorrow' |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/sundance_review_escape_from_tomorrow |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |date=January 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 23, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Many journalists who saw the film at Sundance speculated that it was likely that Disney would take legal action to prevent the film from being shown outside the festival, or perhaps even during it. "Disney's lawyers are probably climbing onto helicopters and planning a raid on Park City right now," wrote McWeeny.<ref name="McWeeny review" /> Critics urged others present to see it before it was too late, and commented that it was questionable if those not present at the festival would ever have an opportunity to see it.<ref name="IndieWire review" /><ref name="CraveOnline review" />

However, others noted that if Disney had attempted to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds it could be done. Moore took care to avoid direct [[copyright infringement]] of songs or films played as part of attractions, and intellectual property law is less clear on the other aspects of the film. Science fiction writer [[Cory Doctorow]], who distributed his first novel, ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'', set in a 22nd-century Disney World, under a [[Creative Commons]] license, believes there's at most "a possible [[trademark infringement|trademark]] claim, and I suppose that Disney could conceivabl[y] bring suit for violating the park's [[Terms of service|terms of use]], but these are much harder cases to make than copyright."<ref name="Cory Doctorow post">{{cite web|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|authorlink=Cory Doctorow|title=More on "Escape From Tomorrow," the guerrilla art-house movie shot at Walt Disney World and Disneyland|url=http://boingboing.net/2013/01/21/more-on-escape-from-tomorrow.html|publisher=[[Boing Boing]]|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

[[Columbia Law School]] professor [[Tim Wu]] did not think Disney would have any defensible intellectual property claim. "Though the filmmakers may have committed trespass when they broke Disney World's rules and if it violated the terms of entry on their tickets, the film itself is a different matter," he wrote on ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s blog. "As commentary on the social ideals of Disney World, it seems to clearly fall within a well-recognized category of [[fair use]], and therefore probably will not be stopped by a court using copyright or trademark laws."<ref name="Wu New Yorker post">{{cite news|last=Wu|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Wu|title=It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Disney World|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/01/escape-from-tomorrow-disney-world-and-the-law-of-fair-use.html|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=January 22, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

Despite the film's repeated use of Disney's characters and iconography, Wu explained, trademark law was not sufficient. "Disney does not have some kind of general intellectual-property right in Disney World itself." To make a trademark-infringement case against Moore, he continued, Disney would have to convince a court that the use of its protected imagery in the movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in the film's production, and he did not think that was a plausible argument. "The scene where a Disney Princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility."<ref name="Wu New Yorker post" />

As for copyright, Wu saw Moore's use of the Disney parks as [[Transformation (law)|transformative]]:
{{quote|... [H]is use of Disney World is not as simple window dressing; he transforms it into something gruesome and disturbing—a place where, for example, guests are sometimes [[taser]]ed and have their imaginations purged ... It might be a violation if Moore had made a film designed for viewers who wanted to see Disney World but were too lazy to go to Florida. ''Escape from Tomorrow,'' however, is clearly no substitute for buying a ticket.<ref name="Wu New Yorker post" />}}
As such, he saw the film as offering artistic commentary on the cultural impact of Disney, and thus clearly falling under fair use. Wu likened it to a 1990s case brought by Mattel against artist Thomas Forsythe, after he sold some of his photographs depicting another American icon, [[Barbie]], being eaten by vintage appliances as a way of calling attention to the toy doll's role in promoting the objectification of women in American culture. Not only did the court dismiss Mattel's complaint, "[t]he judges were so annoyed by the lawsuits that they awarded attorney's fees of nearly two million dollars to the artist ... A judge has to think of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] when asked to ban art work."<ref name="Wu New Yorker post" />

In his /Film review, Sciretta raised another issue:
{{quote|Intellectual property and copyrights aside, many people appear in this film who have never signed a [[Legal release|release]]. Real families and children are seen in the background of almost every shot. None of them gave permission or knew they were being filmed for a feature film.<ref name="/Film post" />}}
At ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Aisha Harris allowed that this was a possibility, especially if children were filmed without their parents' consent, but noted "the law on that issue is not black and white either."<ref name="Slate article">{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Aisha|title=Will Disney Let You See This Movie?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/01/23/escape_from_tomorrow_filmed_secretly_at_disney_parks_can_disney_block_the.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}</ref>

===Response by Disney===
Disney did not return reporters' calls or emails for comment, nor took any legal action during the festival, although it confirmed to [[CNN]] that it was "aware" of the movie.<ref name="CNN story">{{cite news|last=Carey|first=Matthew|title=Why Disney might want to 'Escape From Tomorrow'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/24/showbiz/movies/escape-tomorrow-sundance-disney/|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> Despite critical apprehension that the film would never be shown outside the festival, some observers saw the situation as more complex. Were Disney to attempt to forcefully suppress the film, that effort could serve to draw even more attention to it,<ref name="NY Times article" /> a phenomenon known as the [[Streisand effect]].<ref name="Michael Ryan blog post">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Michael|title=Escape From Tomorrow’ and The Air Pirates|url=http://www.soundonsight.org/escape-from-tomorrow-and-the-air-pirates/|publisher=SoundOnSight.org|date=January 23, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> Even if Disney were to successfully prevent official distribution, the film could easily be pirated and distributed over the Internet. In his ''Post'' review, Smith suggested that Disney prevent this by taking the opposite course, simply ignoring ''Escape from Tomorrow'' and letting the attention dissipate by itself.<ref name="NY Post review" />

Michael Ryan, director of [[The YoungCuts Film Festival]], noted that there was a precedent for the film in the [[Air Pirates#Lawsuit|Air Pirates lawsuit]], in which Disney spent eight years in court with some underground cartoonists who had published an [[underground comix]] parody in which [[Mickey Mouse]] and the other Disney characters engaged in explicit sex and used illegal drugs, among other behavior they avoided in Disney's own narratives. He suggested that Disney buy the rights and release the film itself, which it could easily do as its announced interest would guarantee it a [[monopsony]] on the film since no other distributor would want to match Disney's deep pockets or its feared legal response. As a Disney release, ''Escape from Tomorrow'' would have a large potential audience of both Disney enthusiasts and antagonists, Disney would be making money from property it already owns instead of someone else and the company's apparent willingness to go in the joke would take some of the [[satire|satiric]] edge off.<ref name="Michael Ryan blog post" />

Moore expressed hope that the film could be shown and released, even if it meant a legal battle.
{{quote|It depends on how good a case lawyers can make for it. If they say I have a chance, I'll definitely fight for it. I worked on it really hard for three years and it took a lot out of me. Just to let it disappear would be a waste of time.<ref name="IndieWire interview" />}} Since the film's release Disney has acknowledged it in another way. The online supplement to ''[[Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia]]'' includes an entry for ''Escape from Tomorrow'', describing it as "An independent surrealistic cult film surreptitiously filmed at Walt Disney World and Disneyland."<ref name="Disney encyclopedia supplement" />

According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Disney chose to avoid responding to the film altogether, rather than seeking legal action, in an effort to prevent increased publicity.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abramovitch|first=Seth|title=Disney's Non-Strategy Strategy to Combat Unauthorized Disneyland Horror Movie|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/escape-tomorrow-disneys-strategy-strategy-630906|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=18 September 2013}}</ref>
