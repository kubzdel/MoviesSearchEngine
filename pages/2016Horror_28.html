'''''Blood of the Tribades''''' is a 2016 [[horror film]] directed by [[Sophia Cacciola]] and [[Michael J. Epstein]]. The script, style, and look are heavily influenced by 1970s Euro lesbian vampire films.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blood of the Tribades press materials|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_NXY0mfM82RrioTbS080pM0Ldf2-2zR32yTn7kqOVmw/ }}</ref> The film is distributed in North America on VOD and DVD/blu-ray by Launch Over<ref>{{cite web|title=Rue Morgue|url=http://www.rue-morgue.com/single-post/2017/01/09/Exclusive-commentsdetails-Erotic-vampire-movie-BLOOD-OF-THE-TRIBADES-sees-release}}</ref> and VHS by SRS Media.<ref>{{cite web|title=SRS|url=http://srscinema.com/home/?p=1329}}</ref>

==Description==
Chris Hallock of the [[Boston Underground Film Festival]], where the film had its world premiere on March 27, 2016, calls it, "a love letter to offbeat lesbian vampire films that offers powerful discourse on self-identity, feminism, and the violence wrought from religious dogma."<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Underground Film Festival preview|url=http://bostonunderground.org/2016-films/blood-of-the-tribades/}}</ref>

The film is notable for reversing the typical structure and focus of lesbian vampire films, with ambush bug of [[Ain't it Cool News]] noting, "The lesbian vampire is not new in the realm of horror, but whereas in the past, male filmmakers did their best to make lesbianism seem both erotic as well as the outcasted other, this film actually makes these vamps sympathetic and shifts gears to change the subject to male oppression versus judgment upon free-spirited feminine wiles."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ain't It Cool news|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/77099#9}}</ref>

[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst Magazine]]'s Andrew Marshall examined the film's religious and political allegory in which the words of an ancient religious leader are corrupted over time in order to build favorable power structures: "Through its sex and violence, the film examines the perception of women in an oppressively masculine society, one in which they are taught obedience and complacency, remaining the unwitting victims of theocratic doctrine weaponised by dogmatic fundamentalists. From sapphic symbolism misappropriated by the patriarchal religion to character names representing a disparate assortment of mythologies, the film gradually constructs a culture that could conceivably exist apart from whatever domain may or may not lie beyond the village’s borders, while the rampant histrionic misogyny is not only believable within the story’s context, but is also rendered all-too plausible by recent real-world developments."<ref>{{cite web|title=Starburst Magazine|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/latest-reviews-of-movies/17627-movie-review-blood-of-the-tribades}}</ref>

==Synopsis==
2000 years after the great vampire Bathor established the village of Bathory, superstition and religious violence take over as the men and women battle for control. When the men are afflicted with a mysterious illness, they become certain that the vampire women of Bathory are responsible for their ills, and thus, the hunt begins! Long-forgotten lovers Élisabeth and Fantine find that, with the help of those who were banished, it is their fate to piece together the past and help preserve what little of their society remains before Bathor’s impending return and judgment.
