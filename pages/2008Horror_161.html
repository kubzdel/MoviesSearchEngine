==Production==
In 2004 Khmer graphic designer Tim Pek took a small role for a short film called Chhay. The film was about two brothers and focused on the pre- and post-Khmer Rouge era. Exposed for the first time to how films were produced, Tim started to contemplate various ways to improve the concepts of film making.

A few months later, Tim received a Cambodian Fashion Show video from [[Adelaide]] with an extra feature of a five minutes short film, directed by Chhai Thach. This film, entitled ‘Bugger!’, was made in [[New Zealand]] and had won the best short film award. Impressed with the simple story, Tim got in contact with Chhai and discussed the making of a new short film as a team. A month later, Chhai came up with another mystery story, also set during the Khmer Rouge era. After some discussion, both Tim and Chhai agreed to make three parts of the story. Tim managed to produce a script within a few weeks for a 15-minute short film intended for entry into film festivals.

The film project was created in early 2005 and became ''The Red Sense'', or ''Vignean Krohom'' in Khmer. Pek said of the film: "I had the opportunity to work with various non-actors which I thought would be a terrific opportunity as a director. The casts and crews are very supportive, which continues to keep my spirit high".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://naraths.wordpress.com/2006/10/22/the-red-sense-movie/|title=The Red Sense Movie  |accessdate=2009-01-25|publisher=Naraths}}</ref>

==Release==

===Premier===
Audiences were given a preview of the film in Adelaide, [[Australia]].

The film was banned for release in [[Cambodia]] as the Cambodian Government does not allow films pertaining to the Khmer Rouge. This has become an issue among the film's fans: "'' I really want to watch the Red Sense. I have heard of it for a long time, and I have watched the trailer. It seems interesting. Some people told me that it’s not the same as other Khmer Rouge movies, filmed in the past.''"said a Khmer monk now living abroad, while a foreigner working in the Khmer film industry said, "''It’s a shame that Tim can’t get the film screened over here, but then this is the country where the Khmer Rouge period has been erased from school text books.''"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kwriter.wordpress.com/2008/05/16/cambodian-government-says-no-to-khmer-rouge-movie/|title=Cambodian Government Says No to Khmer Rouge Movie |accessdate=2009-01-25|publisher=Antonio Graceffo}}</ref>

Clayton MP, Mr. Hong Lim also described the film to positive reviews. He said: "''The way he approaches the film is very opportunistic, the way that Tim portrays comes straight from the human heart.
