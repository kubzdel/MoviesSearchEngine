===One Man’s Meat===

The local butcher ([[Frank Scantori]]) has a lethal confrontation with a vampire and decides to use his shop as a perfect way to dispose of the remains.  A regular shopper returns with her family to complain...

After killing a junk shop owner ([[Edward de Souza]]) and stealing his antique mirror, a greedy man ([[Damien Thomas]]) discovers it reveals a portal to another world.

===The Hand===

===Dead Kittens===

A newly recruited member of an all-girl rock group is invited to do a video for their up-and-coming single. Its got to be realistic and it involves blood and guts.  The lengths that modern record companies need to go to sell records is shocking.

===History and Development===

Conceived originally as a three story anthology in the style of British Amicus horror movies, during production a fourth story was added.  The films were shot and edited at Pinewood Studios and filmed in Iver Heath, Windsor and the London area.

The original script ideas came from horror comics published in 1991<ref>{{cite web|last1=Comics|first1=Hamilton|title=Grave Tales|url=http://www.comicvine.com/grave-tales/4050-29048/|website=www.comicvive.com|publisher=Hamilton Comics|accessdate=12 June 2014}}</ref>

Footage of Christopher Lee as himself appeared in the story "Dead Kittens" in the original cut shown at Cine Lumiere and Southend Film Festival and was shown in the original cast list.  The footage was removed from the final cut and DVD release.

Cameo appearance by British Horror Film Director [[Norman J. Warren]] as a music video director in "Dead Kittens".

==Critical reception==

Reported to be a surprisingly high production value film for the low budget.  Good storytelling and acting let down by poor acting in one story "The Hand".  Rated by IMDB 4.9/10.
