==Reception==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}
[[Ain't It Cool News]] gave a mostly positive review for the film, writing "While there are a lot of obvious jokes and bad acting, for no budget, this has some pretty twisted moments. Plus there’s the added benefit of clown sex, which is always amusing. All in all, as far as sleaze goes, ''SLOPPY THE PSYCHOTIC'' is better than most no-budgeters."<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR looks at EXTRATERRESTRIAL! SAVAGELAND! REVELATION TRAIL!

For that I will applaud him. For me, I just couldn’t connect to the material and enjoy it."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Danna|first1=Corey|title=Film Review: Sloppy the Psychotic|url=http://horrornews.net/50019/film-review-sloppy-the-psychotic-2012/|publisher=HorrorNews.net|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>
