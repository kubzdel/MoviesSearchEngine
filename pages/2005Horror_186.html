'''''Wolf Creek''''' is a 2005 Australian [[horror film]] written, co-produced, and directed by [[Greg McLean]], and starring [[John Jarratt]], [[Nathan Phillips (actor)|Nathan Phillips]], [[Cassandra Magrath]], and [[Kestie Morassi]]. Its plot revolves around three backpackers who find themselves taken captive and subsequently hunted by Mick Taylor, a deranged killer, in the Australian [[outback]]. The film was ambiguously marketed as being "based on true events," while its plot bore elements reminiscent of the real-life murders of tourists by [[Backpacker murders|Ivan Milat]] in the 1990s and [[Bradley John Murdoch|Bradley Murdoch]] in 2001, both of which McLean used as inspiration for the screenplay.

Produced on a $1.1 million budget, filming of ''Wolf Creek'' took place in South Australia; the film was shot almost exclusively on [[HDCAM|high-definition video]]. It had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in January 2005. It was given a theatrical release in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in September 2005, followed by a general Australian release in November, apart from the [[Northern Territory]], out of respect for the pending trial surrounding the murder of [[Peter Falconio]].<ref name=mercer/> In the United States and Canada, it was released on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2005, distributed by [[Dimension Films]].

''Wolf Creek'' received varied reviews from film critics, with several, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Manohla Dargis]], criticizing it for its realistic and unrelenting depictions of violence.{{efn-lr|Both Roger Ebert and Manhola Dargis<ref name=dargis/> in their reviews of the film criticized the film's presentation of violence, with Ebert writing that he wanted to walk out of the cinema.<ref name=ebert/>}} Other publications, such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', praised the film's [[grindhouse]] aesthetics, with the latter calling its straightforward depiction of crime and violence "taboo-breaking."<ref name="timeout" /> The film was nominated for seven [[Australian Film Institute]] awards, including Best Director (for McLean). In 2010, it was included in ''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s list of the 100 best films of the decade.<ref name=slant/>

==Plot==
In [[Broome, Western Australia]], 1999, two British tourists, Liz Hunter and Kristy Earl, are [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] across the country with Ben Mitchell, an Australian friend from [[Sydney]]. Ben buys a dilapidated [[Ford XD Falcon]] for their road journey from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] to [[Cairns]], [[Queensland]] via the [[Great Northern Highway]]. The night before leaving, they get drunk at a wild pool party and camp out on the beach.

After stopping at [[Halls Creek, Western Australia|Halls Creek]] for the night, the trio make another stop at [[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolf Creek National Park]], which contains a giant [[Impact crater|crater]] formed by a 50,000-ton [[meteorite]]. Hours later, upon returning to their car, the group discovers that their watches have all suddenly stopped and that the car will not start. Unable to solve the problem, they prepare to sit out the night. After dark, a rural man named Mick Taylor comes across them and offers to tow them to his camp to repair the car. Initially hesitant, the group allows Mick to take them to his place, an abandoned mining site several hours south of Wolf Creek. Mick regales them with tall stories of his past while making a show of fixing their car. His manner unsettles Liz, although Ben and Kristy are less concerned. While they sit around a fire, Mick gives the tourists water which he describes as "rainwater from the top end". The water eventually causes the tourists to fall unconscious.

Liz awakens to find herself gagged and tied up in a shed. She manages to break free, but before she can escape from the mining site, she hears Mick torturing Kristy in a garage, and witnesses him sexually assaulting her. Liz sets the now-dismantled Falcon on fire to distract him, and goes to help Kristy while Mick is busy trying to extinguish the blaze. When he returns, Liz manages to shoot Mick with his own rifle, the bullet hitting him in the neck and apparently killing him. The women attempt to flee the camp in Mick's truck. But before they can do so, Mick stumbles out of the garage, revealing the gunshot was non-fatal and that he's still alive. He proceeds to shoot at them with a double-barreled shotgun before giving chase in another car. The women evade Mick by pushing his truck off a cliff and hiding behind a bush, before returning to the mining site to get another car. Liz leaves the hysterical Kristy outside the gates, telling her to escape on foot if she does not return in five minutes.

Liz enters another garage and discovers Mick's large stock of cars as well as an organised array of travellers' possessions, including video cameras. She watches the playback on one of them and is horrified to see Mick "helping" other travellers stranded at Wolf Creek in almost identical circumstances to her own. She then picks up another camera which turns out to be Ben's, and while viewing some of Ben's footage, notices Mick's truck in the background, indicating he'd been following them long before they got to Wolf Creek. She gets into a car and attempts to start it, but Mick appears in the back seat and stabs her through the driver's seat with a [[bowie knife]]. Liz crawls out of the car, and Mick hacks Liz's fingers off in one swipe, then headbutts her into near unconsciousness. He then severs her spinal cord with the knife, paralyzing her and rendering her a "head on a stick". He then proceeds to interrogate her as to Kristy's whereabouts.

By dawn, a [[barefoot]] Kristy has reached a highway and is discovered by a passing motorist. He attempts to help Kristy, but is shot dead from a distance by Mick, who has a sniper rifle. Mick gives chase in a [[Statesman (automobile)|Holden HQ Statesman]], prompting Kristy to take off in the dead man's car. She succeeds in running Mick off the road, but he gets out of the car and shoots out Kristy's back tire, causing the car to roll. Kristy climbs out of the vehicle and attempts to crawl away, but is shot dead by Mick. He bundles Kristy's body into the back of his car, along with the body of the dead motorist, and torches the wrecked car before driving off.

Ben awakens to find himself nailed to a mock [[crucifix]] in a mine shaft, with two aggressive, caged [[Rottweilers]] in front of him. He manages to extract himself from the crucifix and enters the camp in early daylight. Ben escapes into the outback, but becomes dehydrated, and eventually passes out beside a dirt road. He is discovered by a Swedish couple who take him to [[Kalbarri, Western Australia|Kalbarri]], where he is airlifted to a hospital.

A series of title cards states that despite several major police searches, no trace of Liz or Kristy has ever been found. Early investigations into the case were disorganised, hampered by confusion over the location of the crimes, a lack of physical evidence and the alleged unreliability of the only witness. After four months in police custody, Ben was later cleared of all suspicion. He currently lives in South Australia.  The film ends with the silhouette of Mick walking into the sunset with his rifle in hand.

==Production==
===Inspiration and screenplay===
Writer-director Greg McLean wrote the screenplay for ''Wolf Creek'' in 1997.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} The original screenplay resembled a straightforward [[slasher film]], and McLean was ultimately displeased with the final product.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} After seeing media on serial killer [[Backpacker murders|Ivan Milat]], McLean was inspired to rewrite the screenplay.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=203}} He later said in subsequent interviews that he crafted the character of Mick Taylor based on archetypal "famous Australian exports" such as [[Steve Irwin]], combined with darker national figures, such as Milat, a sadistic killer who murdered seven people in [[New South Wales]] between 1989 and 1993.<ref name=making/> McLean's revised script was significantly anchored in the character of Mick Taylor: "The movie was really about, 'What would it be like to be stuck in this incredibly isolated place with the most evil character you can possibly imagine, who is also distinctly Australian?'", McLean commented in 2006.<ref name=making/> Additionally, the July 2001 abduction of British tourist [[Peter Falconio]] and the assault of his girlfriend [[Joanne Lees]] by [[Bradley John Murdoch]] in the [[Northern Territory]] was cited as an influence.<ref>{{cite web|title=True Story: The Australian Outback Murder|accessdate=26 February 2010|last=Bradtke|first=Birgit|url=http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/wolf_creek_true_story.html|work=Outback Australia Travel Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outback-australia-travel-secrets.com/wolf_creek_true_story.html|work=Outback Australia: Travel Guide|accessdate=27 January 2015|title=The Wolf Creek Movie: the true story of a murder in the Australian Outback?}}</ref> 

The film contains several oblique references to these crimes, including the setting of Taylor's mining camp, which is called "Navithalim Mining Co.", a [[semordnilap]] variation of "Ivan Mila[h]t".{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}}

===Casting===
John Jarratt was cast in the role of Mick Taylor after having a meeting with McLean; Jarratt would later recall being significantly impressed by the screenplay, and McLean knew "within ten minutes" of their meeting that he was the right actor for the role.<ref name=making/> Cassandra Magrath was cast as Liz, as McLean felt she had a "relatable quality" that the character required.<ref name=making/> Nathan Phillips was cast in the role of Ben; McLean had known Phillips prior, as they had met while preparing to work on a project that ultimately fell through.<ref name=making/> Kestie Morassi was cast as Kristy after a different actress had to drop out of the film.<ref name=making/> Incidentally, Morassi was scheduled to take a personal backpacking trip abroad when she was offered the role.<ref name=making/>

===Filming===
[[File:Wolfe Creek Meteorite Crater at Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Wolfe Creek Crater]] is featured prominently in the film]] 
''Wolf Creek'' was a considerably low-budget production, made for around AU$1.4 million, with a minimal crew.<ref name=making/> Producer Gordon Lightfoot stated that the filmmakers wanted to "mak[e] a 5 million dollar film on a 1 million dollar budget."<ref name=making/> The film was shot digitally on the [[HDCAM]] format and was mostly handheld (aside from a few static [[compositing|composite]] shots).<ref name=making/> Filming took place over five weeks<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:11:11)</ref> in Australia's winter months of 2004 almost entirely in [[South Australia]];<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:06:05)</ref> aerial shots of the crater, however, show the genuine Wolfe Creek crater.<ref name=making/> The film is set in a real location; however, the actual meteorite crater location is called "[[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolfe Creek]]", and is located in northern Western Australia. The sequences in which the three main characters ascend the edge of crater were shot on a nondescript hillside in South Australia,<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:26:10)</ref> while beachfront scenes in the first fifteen minutes of the film were shot in Adelaide, standing in for Broome.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:04:58)</ref> 

Several strange occurrences happened during the production. One particular location that was used during the shooting of the travellers' drive to Wolf Creek had not seen rainfall in over six years; however, once the crew arrived and shooting proceeded, it rained for three continuous days, forcing the writer, director and actors to incorporate the highly unexpected rainfall into the shooting script.<ref name=making/> According to McLean, the fact that it was raining and gloomy in an otherwise dry, sunny desert area gave the sequences a feel of "menace."<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:24:05–25:30)</ref> 

The rock quarry where Mick's mining site is located was the site of a real-life murder, which stirred up controversy from the local residents who mistook the film as being based on that crime.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:45:19)</ref> According to director McLean and others, Jarratt went to extremes in preparing for his role as Mick, in a bid to emulate, as close as possible, the real-life serial killer [[Backpacker Murders|Ivan Milat]]: he spent significant time alone in the isolated outback and went for weeks without showering.<ref name=making>{{cite video|title=The Making of Wolf Creek Documentary|medium=DVD|publisher=Genius Productions|year=2006|work=Wolf Creek}}</ref>

Since the film had a relatively low budget, many of the action scenes involved the real actors; for example, after running through the outback [[barefoot]] when her character escapes, star Kestie Morassi ended up with hundreds of thorns and nettles in her feet.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (1:26:40)</ref> During the shooting of Morassi's torture scene in the shed, her non-stop screams and crying began to discomfort and unsettle the crew; executive producer Matt Hearn said that the female members of the shooting crew were brought to tears by it, as if someone were actually being tortured.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:56:53)</ref>

===Post-production===
The original cut of ''Wolf Creek'' ran 104 minutes; however, 5 minutes of the film were excised in [[post-production]].<ref name=making/> The surplus footage in this cut included an additional scene at the beginning of the film after the party sequence, in which Kristy awakens in bed next to Ben at a beach cottage the following morning; this created a romantic subplot between the characters, and was cut from the film for "complicating" matters unnecessarily.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (0:07:32)</ref>

The other additional footage took place when Liz returns to the mining site after leaving Kristy behind; rather than immediately entering the car garage, as she does in the theatrical cut, she finds a revolver and fills it with cartridges, and then explores an abandoned mine shaft in order to search for Ben. She subsequently drops her pistol into the shaft, and climbs down inside to find dozens of decomposing bodies. This explains why, in the theatrical cut, the revolver disappears after she enters the car garage. According to McLean, this scene was cut from the film after [[test screening]]s because it was "simply too much", along with all of the other gruesome events that had taken place prior.<ref>[[#McLean|McLean et al. 2006]] (1:18:09)</ref>

==Release==
''Wolf Creek'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]], United States, on 24 January 2005.<ref name=getty>{{cite web|work=[[Getty Images]]|title=2005 Sundance Film Festival - "Wolf Creek" Premiere|date=24 January 2005|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/event/sundance-film-festival-wolf-creek-premiere-107659577#/greg-mcclean-and-nathan-phillips-during-2005-sundance-film-festival-picture-id116949558|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> Exactly one month prior to the film's Sundance premiere, [[Dimension Films]] acquired North American distribution rights for US$3.5 million.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Dimension up a scary 'Creek'|date=3 January 2005|accessdate=14 April 2018|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/dimension-up-a-scary-creek-1117915676|author1=Dunkley, Cathy|author2=Harris, Dana}}</ref> It was subsequently screened in [[Adelaide]], Australia in March 2005, followed by screenings at the [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and the [[Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=screen>{{cite web|work=[[Screen Australia]]|series=The Screen Guide|title=Wolf Creek (2005)|url=https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/the-screen-guide/t/wolf-creek-2005/19891/|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>

===Marketing===
''Wolf Creek'' was marketed in both Australia and international markets as being "based on a true story", though it is in actuality a composite inspired by several true crimes (including the aforementioned killings by Milat and Murdoch).{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}} 

===Box office===
In Australia, the film opened on 151 cinemas on 3 November 2005, excluding the [[Northern Territory]], out of respect for the pending trial for the murder of [[Peter Falconio]], an event which had served as a partial inspiration for the screenplay.<ref name=mercer>{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Australia gripped by Falconio Mystery|date=16 October 2005|accessdate=27 February 2010|author=Mercer, Phil|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4344690.stm}}</ref><ref name=puzzles>{{cite web|work=ABC News Australia|title='Wolf Creek' ban puzzles director|date=15 December 2005|accessdate=26 February 2010|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200512/s1531954.htm}}</ref> The trial for Falconio's accused killer, Bradley Murdoch, was still under way at the time, and for this reason the Northern Territory court placed an injunction on the film's release there in the belief that it could influence the outcome of the proceedings;<ref name=mercer/><ref name=puzzles/> Murdoch was eventually found guilty of murder on 13 December 2005.{{sfn|Shelley|2012|p=204}} The film earned [[Australian dollar|AU]]$1.2 million during its opening weekend,<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/australia/?yr=2005&wk=44&currency=local&p=.htm|title=Australian Box Office, November 3–6, 2005|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> entering the Australian box office at number one.<ref name=aubo>{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=Wolf Creek (2005) - International Box Office Results - Australia|accessdate=April 14, 2018|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&country=AU&id=wolfcreek.htm}}</ref> It would go on to gross a total of AU$4,560,118 domestically.<ref name=aubo/>

===Critical response===
====Contemporaneous====
Upon the film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2005, Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film's "richly atmospheric" photography and McLean's direction, comparing it to ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', though noting: "Ending on a rather bleak note, and lacking the kind of false scares or other devices that normally give horror auds an occasional breather, [''Wolf Creek''] is scary cinema pushed to the brink of punishment. But there’s no question that what it sets out to do, it does alarmingly well."<ref name=harvey>{{cite web|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Wolf Creek|date=27 January 2005|accessdate=14 April 2018|url=https://variety.com/2005/film/markets-festivals/wolf-creek-1200528417/|author=Harvey, Dennis}}</ref>

Paul Byrnes of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' praised Jarratt's performance in the film, ultimately deeming it "exceptional Aussie horror".<ref>{{cite web|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Wolf Creek|author=Byrnes, Paul|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/film-reviews/wolf-creek/2005/11/04/1130823377067.html|date=4 November 2005|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Age]]''{{'}}s Jim Schembri called the film "a cheaply made, highly derivative, blood-soaked splatter film in which a clutch of young people on holiday encounter a psychopath with a love for dismemberment and laughing out loud when he hurts someone", though noted: "What sets [it] apart is the skill with which McLean synthesizes his cinematic sampling into a seamless, deeply seductive narrative.

Critical reviews in the United States varied: Several critics, such as the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''{{'}}s [[Roger Ebert]], lambasted the film's depiction of violence, and with some even walking out of screenings.{{sfn|Aveyard|Moran|Vieth|2017|p=249}} Ebert awarded the film a zero out of four stars, writing: "It is a film with one clear purpose: To establish the commercial credentials of its director by showing his skill at depicting the brutal tracking, torture and mutilation of screaming young women ... I wanted to walk out of the theatre and ... keep on walking".<ref name=ebert>{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wolf-creek-2005 |title=Wolf Creek Movie Review & Film Summary (2005) |work=Chicago Sun-Times|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |date=22 December 2005 |accessdate=7 November 2009}}</ref> Similarly, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' film critic Moira Macdonald wrote that ''Wolf Creek'' was the first film she ever walked out of; she called watching the film "punishment" and wondered how someone's real death inspired this "entertainment".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|location=[[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/a-first-a-movie-that-made-this-critic-walk-out/|author=Macdonald, Moira|date=25 December 2005|accessdate=14 April 2018|title=A first: a movie that made this critic walk out}}</ref> [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted: "Mr. McLean has apparently watched his share of [[Val Lewton]], the legendary B-movie producer... who could raise shivers just by dimming the lights.

Michael Atkinson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote of the film: "The ambitions are so paltry that our response should be too: ''Wolf Creek'' is unimaginative, light on the grue and heavy on the faux-serious desperation. It's actually something of a Spanish Inquisition–level trial by overacting—the three leads are low-budget dull, but as the anti–[[Crocodile Dundee]], Jarratt is a leering, jeering, winking, colloquialism-belching horror".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Village Voice]]|title=Up a Creek, no Paddle: Chainsaw Ripoff Full of Cruel Claptrap|author=Atkinson, Michael|date=20 December 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101134744/https://www.villagevoice.com/film/0551,atkinson,71158,20.html|archivedate=1 January 2007|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/film/0551,atkinson,71158,20.html}}</ref> G. Allen Johnson of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', however, praised the film's "naturalistic" style, writing: "What's Christmas Day without a good serial killer movie? There are no obnoxious teenagers in ''Wolf Creek'', nor are there ghosts, possessed children, haunted web sites or supernaturally produced videotapes. There isn't even an Asian horror film upon which to base the screenplay. Instead, there is desolation, real terror and one hell of a villain in rural Australia in Greg McLean's energetically gritty bit of low-budget showmanship".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Johnson, G.

In ''A Companion to the Horror Film'' (2017), film scholar Harry Benshoff cites ''Wolf Creek'' as a "distinguished" example of the "[[torture porn]]" subgenera, noting its "detailed character development... compelling performances... and sustained use of dread" as key features.{{sfn|Benshoff|2017|p=351}} Additionally, he praised the film's cinematography and sound design, which "mirrors the development of narrative intensity".{{sfn|Benshoff|2017|pages=354–55}}
