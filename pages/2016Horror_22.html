==Plot==
Mike Milch ([[John Gallagher Jr.]]), an employee of Belko Industries, arrives at his remote office building in rural [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], to find unfamiliar security guards turning away the local Colombian staff at the gate. New employee Dany Wilkins ([[Melonie Diaz]]) reports for her first day on the job, and is told that a tracking device is implanted in the base of every Belko employee's skull in case they are kidnapped. This is common in Colombia due to the high incidence of kidnapping.

Evan Smith ([[James Earl]]), Belko's head security guard, does not know who the new security guards are. Once the eightieth employee shows up, a voice on the intercom instructs the co-workers to kill two of their co-workers, or else four workers will be killed at random. Several staff attempt to flee the building, but steel shutters seal off the walls and doors, locking them all in. They ignore the announcement at first, believing it to be a prank, but four employees die when explosives hidden in their trackers detonate and blow their heads apart. Mike attempts to remove his tracker with a box cutter. Warned by the voice that he too will die unless he stops, he gives up.

The group is told that unless thirty of them are dead within two hours, sixty will be killed. They split into two factions, one led by Mike who believes that there should be no killing, and [[chief operating officer]] boss Barry Norris ([[Tony Goldwyn]]) who intends to follow the directions in order to save himself. Barry and his group attempt to burn off the lock of the armory in order to gain access to its weapons. Mike and his group, including his girlfriend Leandra Florez ([[Adria Arjona]]), Evan and employees Keith ([[Josh Brener]]), Leota ([[Gail Bean]]), Peggy ([[Rusty Schwimmer]]), Vince ([[Brent Sexton]]) and Roberto ([[David Del Rio]]), try to hang banners from the roof as a call for help, but soldiers outside shoot at them. Barry, executive Wendell ([[John C. McGinley]]), and employee Terry ([[Owain Yeoman]]) ambush the group in the stairway, kill Evan and take his keys to the armory.

With his group now armed, Barry and Wendell select thirty people, including Mike and Peggy, forcing them to kneel in a line. He begins executing them with a gunshot to the back of the head. Dany, who has been hiding in the basement, sees what is happening and shuts off the building's lights before Mike and several others can be killed. During this, Dany goes into the elevator shaft with Roberto.

Barry and Wendell hunt down the fleeing employees as the voice informs them that only twenty-nine have been killed. The two-hour time limit runs out and Terry, Leota, Peggy and Keith, along with twenty-nine other employees, have their trackers explode, leaving only 16 survivors. Barry finds Dany and Roberto in the elevator shaft, but Dany escapes while Roberto is crushed and killed in the elevator shaft. Two employees, Marty ([[Sean Gunn]]) and Chet ([[Abraham Benrubi]]) collect the un-exploded trackers from the heads of people who have died by other methods, planning to use them to blow up the wall. However, they are killed by Wendell. Leandra kills Wendell, and Barry kills Vince and Dany. He then shoots Leandra, who dies shortly after. Mike and Barry are left as the only two survivors.

In a rage, Mike kills Barry with a [[tape dispenser]]. The building is then unsealed, as he is the last survivor, and the soldiers escort him to the hangar next door. There, he meets the owner of the voice ([[Gregg Henry]]), who introduces himself as a social scientist who believes that discoveries about human nature can only come from placing people in extreme environments. As he and his colleagues begin to question Mike about his emotional and mental state, Mike notices a panel of switches that correspond to the eighty employees. Having planted the trackers that Marty collected on the soldiers and the Voice, he flips every switch except his own. The trackers explode, killing the soldiers and wounding the Voice, before Mike grabs a gun and kills the remaining scientists. The Voice attempts to reason with Mike but Mike kills him. He then leaves the warehouse in a state of shock. The view zooms out to reveal that Mike is one of many sole survivors from similar experiments, being watched by another group through security cameras. A new voice states "end stage one" and "commence stage two."

==Production==
[[James Gunn]] began writing the film after waking up from a dream of an office building being enclosed in metal walls and hearing a voice instruct employees to kill each other. Initially Gunn wrote the film (as ''The Belco Experiment'') prior to directing the 2010 film ''[[Super (2010 American film)|Super]]'', although he backed away from the project once it got [[greenlit]], owing to getting a divorce around the same time.<ref name="denofgeek">{{cite web|last1=Kaye|first1=Don|title=James Gunn Talks The Belko Experiment, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/james-gunn/260502/james-gunn-talks-the-belko-experiment-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Says Gunn "I just wanted to be around my friends and family. I didn't want to go shoot this thing that was about people who loved and cared about each other being forced into killing each other. It just didn't seem to be the way I wanted to spend the next few months of my life. So I backed out of it."<ref name="denofgeek"/> As Gunn's name became bigger and bigger he had "kind of forgotten about it" until he received a call from Jon Glickman at  MGM asking if he would still be interested in making it.<ref name="denofgeek"/>
