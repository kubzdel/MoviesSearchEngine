'''''31''''' is a 2016 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Rob Zombie]], and starring an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Sheri Moon Zombie]], [[Jeff Daniel Phillips]], [[Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs]], [[Meg Foster]], [[Richard Brake]], [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[E.G. Daily]], [[Judy Geeson]], and [[Jane Carr]].

A [[period piece]] set in 1976, the film is about five [[carnies]] who are kidnapped by a gang of clowns called "The Heads" and forced to play a survival game called "31", where they are chased by the clowns through a maze of rooms over 12 hours, the penalty for capture being torture and murder, while bets are placed on their progress.

The film was [[Crowdfunding|crowdfunded]] online twice at fanbacked.com.<ref name=WT>{{cite web | last1=Dunham | first1=Nancy | title=Rob Zombie is back, he's ready to yak about next horror flick | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/7/rob-zombie-back-hes-ready-yak-about-next-horror-fl/ | publisher=Washington Times | accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> At a [[test screening]], Zombie compared ''31'' to his 2005 film ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rob Zombie Screens '31' and Compares it to 'The Devil's Rejects' and fans have compared it to the Halloween remake. |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/images/3362398/rob-zombie-screens-31-and-compares-it-to-the-devils-rejects/ | publisher=Bloody Disgusting | accessdate=October 19, 2015}}</ref>

==Plot==
During Halloween 1976, a group of carnival workers, Charly, Venus, Panda, Levon, and Roscoe, are attacked and taken to a strange, large building where three elderly people wearing aristocratic clothes, powdered wigs and make up - Sister Dragon, Sister Serpent, and their leader Father Napoleon-Horatio-Silas Murder - tell them that they are going to play the game "31" and that it will last for the next 12 hours. The group is placed in a series of maze-like set of rooms, where they must defend themselves against the "Heads", several murderous clowns who intend to torture and murder them, all the while the group are given odds for their survival and bets are placed on them.

The protagonists come across five "Heads", Sick-Head, Psycho-Head, Schizo-Head, Death-Head, and Sex-Head. The carnies eventually manage to kill their assailants, but not without sustaining their own casualties, with only Charly, Venus, and Roscoe left alive. The remaining three try to find a way out, but only manage to get one of their number—Venus—trapped inside a boiler room, where she is brutally murdered by the final Head, Doom-Head, who was brought in by the aristocrats to join the game. Doom-Head taunts Charly and Roscoe, telling them that the doors have been opened to the outside world.

The two manage to make it to one of the exits, however Roscoe urges Charly to go on without him, as the night's event has left him too severely wounded to progress. Roscoe is then stabbed to death by Doom-Head. Charly, who made it outside but found herself in the middle of nowhere, makes her way into an abandoned house where she is ambushed by Doom-Head. He almost overtakes her, however Doom-Head is stopped by the aristocrats, who tell him that time has run out and Charly must go free. The aristocrats are concerned that Charly is the first person to win "31." This doesn't satisfy Doom-Head; later he catches up with Charly, who is bloody and limping down an isolated road. He alights from a van and takes out his daggers as he and Charly prepare for one last confrontation as the film ends, leaving their fates unknown.

==Production==
Plans to create ''31'' were first announced in May 2014 via a [[teaser poster]] that showed the words "a Rob Zombie film", a bloody clown face, and the number "31".<ref name=BD>{{cite web|title=Rob Zombie Returns to Horror With '31'!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/videos/3294339/rob-zombie-returns-horror-31/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Fans and media outlets speculated that the film would be a third film in the ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' and ''[[The Devil's Rejects]]'' universe and would follow [[Sid Haig]]'s character [[Captain Spaulding (Rob Zombie)|Captain Spaulding]], that it could be a film centering upon serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]], or that it would be a third film in Zombie's rebooted ''[[Halloween (franchise)#Future|Halloween]]'' film series.<ref name=EO>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Owen|title=Rob Zombie Reveals The Secret Of 31|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=41799|publisher=Empire Online|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Zombie commented on the speculation, stating that it would not follow Captain Spaulding and would be an original story and was not based on any previous work.<ref name=BD2>{{cite web|title=Rob Zombie Talks Halloween Horror '31'!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3300403/rob-zombie-talks-halloween-horror-31/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> He also noted that ''31'' referred to October 31, Halloween.<ref name=BD2 /> In July, Zombie announced the plot of ''31'', which follows a group of five people that are forced to participate in a gruesome game called "31".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Perlman|first1=Jake|title=Rob Zombie is crowdfunding his new killer clown movie, '31'|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/07/31/rob-zombie-crowdfunding-killer-clown-movie-31/|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Zombie also stated that he would use crowdfunding to cover part of the movie's costs, because "as the years go on, the game changes all the time, and a movie that you could get made years ago, you cannot get made anymore, because the business changes, things change."<ref name=LW>{{cite web|last1=Childers|first1=Chad|title=Rob Zombie Explains Why He Is Crowd-Funding His Upcoming Horror Film '31'|url=http://loudwire.com/rob-zombie-explains-crowd-funding-horror-film-31/|publisher=Loudwire|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> He added that crowdfunding would allow him to make a movie that might not have been otherwise funded traditionally and that "if you wanna do stuff outside the system, you've gotta function outside the system".<ref name=LW /> Zombie later held a second Fanbacked.com campaign in February 2015 to raise additional funds for the film,<ref>{{cite web|title=New '31' Art As Rob Zombie Relaunches Campaign; Tour Dates!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3331687/new-31-art-rob-zombie-relaunches-campaign/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref> stating that it was due to multiple requests from fans that wanted to contribute funding.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Rob|title=Rob Zombie Wants Your Money Again and You're Gonna Want to Give It to Him|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/02/17/rob-zombie-wants-your-money-again-and-you-re-gonna-want-to-give-it-to-him-2703042?lt_source=external,manual|publisher=MoviePilot|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref>

Zombie came up with the idea for ''31'' after reading a statistic that stated that Halloween is the "Number One day of the year when people go missing for some reason" and thought that it would make a good premise for a movie.<ref name=RS>{{cite web|last1=Grow|first1=Kori|title=Rob Zombie Talks Insane Clowns and Crowdfunding His New Film '31'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/rob-zombie-talks-insane-clowns-and-crowdfunding-his-new-film-31-20140731|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> He also received inspiration for the film as he was walking around his frightfest Great American Nightmare and watched the employees work while dressed like chainsaw-carrying clowns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rob Zombie's '31' Takes Place In 1975, and More&nbsp;... |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3307987/rob-zombies-31-takes-place-1975/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref> Zombie has stated that he wanted to have a "very nasty, gritty, guerilla-style approach to the filmmaking" for ''31'', as it "fits the story and the vibe of the movie".<ref name=RS /> Zombie began scouting locations in the summer of 2014 and initial filming was slated to begin in February 2015, but did not commence until that March.<ref name=RS /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Harrington|first1=Jim|title=Interview: Rob Zombie discusses new album, tour and film project|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_26491928/interview-rob-zombie-discusses-new-album-tour-and|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=blabbermouth>{{cite web|title=ROB ZOMBIE's '31' Movie: Video Footage From Pre-Production|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombies-31-movie-video-footage-from-pre-production/|publisher=Blabbermouth|accessdate=21 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Zombie|first1=Rob|title=MALCOLM MCDOWELL JOINS 31 CAST AS FIRST DAY OF FILMING IS COMPLETED|url=http://robzombie.com/2015/03/malcolm-mcdowell-joins-31-cast-as-first-day-of-filming-is-completed/|publisher=Rob Zombie|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref> Filming for ''31'' wrapped in April 2015.<ref name=bd>{{cite web|title=Rob Zombie's '31' Wraps, and He's Still Announcing Cast!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3339240/rob-zombies-31-wraps-hes-still-announcing-cast/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=8 April 2015}}</ref>

===Rating===
''31'' was submitted to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] twice and both times received an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#X replaced by NC-17|NC-17 rating]]. The description as given by the MPAA notes "sadistic graphic violence, bizarre sexuality/nudity, pervasive disturbing images and some strong language."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3374302/rob-zombies-31-lands-nc-17-rating/ | title=Rob Zombie's '31' Receives NC-17 Rating&nbsp;...

===Critical reception===
The film holds an approval rating of 50% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 31 reviews and has an average rating of 5.3 out of 10. The site's consensus reads "''31'' delivers all the high-energy gore Rob Zombie fans have come to expect, but a lack of fresh ideas and likable characters mean only the already converted need apply".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/31/ | title=''31'' (2016) | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher=[[Flixster]] | accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 35 out of 100 based on 13 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/31 | title=''31'' reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>

Much of the film's negativity centered around claims that the film felt forced and unoriginal, with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' writing that the "energetic exercise in forced badassery will be too silly and self-conscious to feel genuinely edgy, despite all the blood spilt and familiar taboos violated."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sundance Film Review: '31'|url = https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/31-review-sundance-rob-zombie-1201687701/|website = Variety|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US|first = Dennis|last = Harvey}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Sundance Film Review: 31|url = http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/01/film-review-31/|website = Consequence of Sound|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = '31': Sundance Review|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/31-sundance-review-860210|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = 2016-02-06}}</ref>

The film received praise from [[Bloody Disgusting]], which claimed "''31'' is Rob Zombie's ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' and it works".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sundance Review of Rob Zombie's '31'|url = http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3377668/sundance-review-31-rob-zombie/|website = Bloody Disgusting!|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}</ref> Trent Wilkie of ''[[Fangoria]]'' gave the film a mixed review saying "It is violent and campy, with the requisite sex, blood, profanity and gore. But ultimately, it feels rushed and leaves one with the sense of an unfinished idea."<ref>{{Cite web|title = "31" (Sundance Movie Review)|url = http://www.fangoria.com/new/31-sundance-movie-review/|website = FANGORIA®|access-date = 2016-02-06}}</ref> However, Jerry Smith, also writing for ''Fangoria'', put it on his year's "Top Ten" list saying "''31'' is a mean as hell, take no prisoners exploitation film filled to the absolute brim with mean as all hell clowns, carnies and by far one of the best horror performances of the year."<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jerry|title=The Year in Horror, 2016: Jerry’s Top 10 Horror Films!|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-year-in-horror-2016-jerrys-top-10-horror-films/|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=December 27, 2016}}</ref>

[[Shock Till You Drop]] gave the film approval with a caveat saying "Rob Zombie's ''31'' succeeds as a throwback to the days of quickie exploitation movies. That's exactly what it is trying to be, and what it is. So, if you want caviar, keep looking. But if you are in the mood for a candy-colored bacon cheeseburger of a flick with extra grease and BBQ sauce, ''31'' is for you".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sundance Review: Rob Zombie's 31 is a Bizarre Horror-Tattoo Come to Life|url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/reviews/395733-sundance-review-rob-zombies-31-bizarre-horror-tattoo-come-life/|website = Shock Till You Drop|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}</ref> In a similar vein, [[Film School Rejects]] commented that "''31'' is Zombie's mildly entertaining take on a stale and simple setup. You already know if it's for you".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sundance 2016: Rob Zombie Takes One Step Backward With 31|url = http://filmschoolrejects.com/reviews/31.php|website = Film School Rejects|access-date = 2016-02-06|language = en-US}}</ref>
