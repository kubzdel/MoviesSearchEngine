'''''Good Will Evil''''' ({{zh|t=兇魅|s=凶魅|p=Xiōng Mèi}}) is a 2008 Taiwanese horror film directed by Lin Yu-fen and Wang Ming-chan, starring [[Terri Kwan]], Tammy Chen, Leon Dai, [[Lu Yi-ching]], [[Cindy Chi]] and Chen Wen-cheng. It was released on November 7, 2008 in Taiwan. The Chinese title of the movie is a heterograph of 兄妹 (xiōng mèi), which means "elder brother and younger sister".

==Plot==
Tseng, a successful young politician, wants to start a family but his wife, Yi-hsi, opposes his decision because she has emotional problems and feels that she cannot accept the responsibility of motherhood. He manages to convince her to adopt a girl called Tien, but they are not sure about the child's background. The girl behaves strangely and hardly speaks, except to a doll she carries with her all the time. Once, the housekeeper throws away the doll after it caused the washing machine to be jammed, but she is attacked by a strange force and ends up in hospital later. On another occasion in school, two boys try to bully Tien but the teacher, Ms Chung, finds the bullies tied up together by red strings later. The horrified bullies claim that Tien's doll was the one who tied them up. Ms Chung's mother, a spiritualist, begins to have visions about Tien and she manages to unravel the mystery. Tien comes from a broken family and her elder brother, You, was the only one who cared about her. After You was killed in an accident (the house fire in the opening scene), his spirit possesses the doll and stays by his sister to protect her.
