'''''Mimic 3: Sentinel''''' is a 2003 [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]], [[film director|directed]] by [[J. T. Petty]],<ref name="scarecrow">{{cite book | author=The Staff and Friends of Scarecrow Video | year=2004 | title=The Scarecrow Movie Guide | pages=630&ndash;723 | publisher=Sasquatch Books | location=Seattle | isbn=1-57061-415-6 }}</ref> with a script inspired by a short story of the same name by [[Donald A. Wollheim]]. The movie was a direct-to-DVD sequel to ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997) and ''[[Mimic 2]]'' (2001).

''Mimic 3: Sentinel'' stars horror film veteran [[Lance Henriksen]] and takes a departure from the tone of the first two films, as it has a feel similar to Alfred Hitchcock's ''[[Rear Window]]'' rather than the action/horror tone of its predecessors.

==Plot==
Unable to leave the germ-free confines of his sterilized bedroom for any real stretch of time, [[Multiple chemical sensitivity|environmentally hypersensitive]] Marvin ([[Karl Geary]]) spends his days taking pictures of his neighbors from his window. Occasionally catching glimpses of his young sister Rosy ([[Alexis Dziena]]) hanging out with the neighborhood drug dealer, Marvin's lens remains mostly fixed on a mysterious neighbor known as the Garbageman ([[Lance Henriksen]]) and pretty neighbor Carmen ([[Rebecca Mader]]), while his slightly overbearing mother ([[Amanda Plummer]]) rests on the couch. As neighbors begin disappearing and mysterious figures move in and out of Marvin's viewfinder, the secluded voyeur begins to suspect that a sinister force is at work in his neighborhood. Though Rosy and Carmen are anxious to assist in a little detective work, the situation soon begins to spiral out of control upon the discovery that the Judas Breed is far from extinct.
