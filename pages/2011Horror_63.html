The film takes place on an undisclosed island on a foggy, winter day. [[Victor Frankenstein]] and his bride, Elizabeth, are set to be married by a priest who is rowed in on a small raft. But all is not well on the day of these young lovers’ wedding: The ceremony is clearly being conducted in secret, and Victor and Elizabeth are under the protection of seven well-armed mercenaries. All parties soon find themselves being stalked by a seemingly supernatural enemy of great physical strength that dwells in the woods surrounding the small chapel...a monster who kills with swiftness and purpose. As the slaughter escalates and the characters begin to die one by one at the hands of this mysterious Creature, Victor is forced to confess the unholy crimes he committed that has placed himself and the others in this deadly predicament. Meanwhile, as each character faces certain death, the beast’s ultimate target reveals itself not to be Victor, but his bride.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wix.com/sglentertainment/frankenstein#!__site/synopsis |title=Synopsis from official website |accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Responses from the premiere have been positive, with reviews praising the film primarily for its homages to horror films produced by [[Hammer Studios]]. Patrick McDonald of ''Hollywoodchicago.com'' awarded the film 3 stars out of 5: "It has all the familiar Frankenstein monster elements, but also delivers a certain style and authority that allows it to make its own mark. The acting, setting, costumes and dialogue screams [[drive-in]] movie fare, but the production gamely reaches out to retell the myth with a little sex, a lot of gore and an interesting take on the reanimation portion of the monster."<ref>"Creature Feature Vibe in ‘Frankenstein: Day of the Beast.’" Review by Patrick McDonald.''Hollywood Chicago''. November 27, 2011</ref> John Collins of ''Weirdreview.com'' also recommends the film primarily for its nostalgic qualities, and he adds, "This is easily the most viscous, evil Frankenstein’s monster I have ever encountered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weirdreview.com/2011/11/28/ricardo_islas/ |title=''Frankenstein Day of the Beast'' – A Review Plus Interviews with Ricardo Islas in English and Spanish |last=Collins |first=John |work=WeirdReview.com |date=November 28, 2011 |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]'' writes, "Its diversions from [the original] story made me look past the rough edges that go along with low budget and amateur acting. ...
