== Alternate versions ==
When it premiered  in October 2004 on [[ABC Family]] [[Television channel|channel]] ''The Hollow'' was trimmed slightly to eliminate the violence of the Headless Horseman's attacks, and several of the lines had to be re-dubbed to eliminate promiscuous references and graphic profanity.  The entire sequence of Rob and Erica's [[Affair|liaison]] and attack had several different cuts. Rob's severed head was also edited out of frame.  The deaths of Erica, Sheriff Duncan, and Marcus were toned down slightly eliminating their bodies' blood flow, but leaving the sound of the Horseman's sword slashing at their throats.  Karen's discovery of all the severed heads also had an alternate shot to not show the gore dripping from them. 

== 2015 Movie ==
Another movie named ''The Hollow '' has been shown on the [[Syfy|Syfy Channel]]. This movie is not a remake, and has a completely different plot.
