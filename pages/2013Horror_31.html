==Synopsis==
Fifteen years ago Bobby (Marshall Caswell) and his friends tormented their [[Little League Baseball|little league]] teammate Billy Haskins after he lost them a big game. In retaliation Billy murdered two of their teammates and their coach before he was stopped and placed in a mental institution. Bobby moved away afterwards, but has returned years later in 1996 to reconnect with everyone. This reunion is cut short when someone dressed as an old fashioned umpire begins killing any survivors from the team, making the survivors fear for their lives.

==Production==
Rosas and Sommer, both of whom had worked together previously on the film ''[[Blood Junkie]]'', began developing ''Billy Club'' as both wanted to "make a slasher movie in the vein of the classic boogie men movies of the ‘80s and ‘90s" and felt that the theme of baseball "lends itself to the horror genre really well".<ref name="STYD">{{cite web|title=Shock Interview: Drew Rosas On His Slasher Film, Billy Club|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/176533-shock-interview-billy-club-director-drew-rosas/|publisher=STYD|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> Funding was partially raised through a private investor as well as through Kickstarter.<ref name="DVDV">{{cite web|title=Drew Rosas: Financing a Dream|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/interview_rosas|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=24 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105519/http://www.dvdverdict.com/interview_rosas|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}</ref> Sommer designed the killer's weapon to incorporate a "bolt-action retractable bayonet blade that comes out the end", as he wanted to make it different from the typical "baseball bat with nails in it".<ref name="STYD" /> Filming took place in northern Wisconsin and several baseball players from [[McDonough, Georgia|McDonough, Georgia's]] [[Union Grove High School]] were brought on to portray the young versions of the main characters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Union Grove high schoolers get screen time in horror flick|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/union-grove-high-schoolers-get-screen-time-in-horror-flick/article_b027a280-2efb-11e3-864c-0019bb2963f4.html|publisher=Journal Times|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title="Billy Club" takes a stab at bringing the slasher movie back|url=http://onmilwaukee.com/movies/articles/billyclubinterview.html|publisher=On Milwaukee|accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref>
