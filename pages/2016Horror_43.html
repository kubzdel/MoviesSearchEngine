==Plot==
Thomas Kaiser, a painter, regularly has recurring dreams in which he sees a beautiful sleeping girl named [[Sleeping Beauty|Briar Rose]] ([[India Eisley]]), but is unable to wake her. When he attempts to kiss her he is awakened by searing headaches. While painting he sees an elusive apparition of Rose and receives a phone call from a law firm informing him of an inheritance from his uncle, Clive.

Thomas goes to the law firm and is informed his uncle left him a letter and property known as Kaiser Gardens before committing suicide. The letter tells him to never go to the lower levels of the building and that the family is cursed. Thomas has no interest and desires only to appraise the value and sell the property. While at Kaiser Gardens, Thomas runs into a realtor Linda ([[Natalie Hall]]) who gives him the keys and asks him a series of questions. That night while sleeping at the property he dreams of Rose and is able to kiss and awaken her. She tells him her name and that he can wake her now that they are close in the physical world. He has a [[false awakening|false awakening]] to an attack from The Veiled Demon. He wakes up from the nightmare to Billings (Scott Alan Smith) an appraiser knocking on the front door. The appraiser tells him many people went missing in the house, but the police found nothing. Thomas explores the house and finds [[mannequin]]s and an unmovable door shrine.

Later, while researching the property, Thomas collapses. He discovers a note from Linda regarding a prior appraisal attempt. He confronts her and she informs him her brother went missing in the house. Thomas collapses again and dreams of Rose. She tells him he must awaken her and the property belongs to his bloodline. Thomas awakens, Linda informs him that based on her research he is bound to the property supernaturally and will die if he leaves Kaiser Gardens too long. They return to the property and open the shrine door using Thomas' blood revealing a room. They open a book with seals and are attacked by the mannequins in the house. They escape the house with the book and are rescued by Richard ([[Bruce Davison]]), a paranormal investigator who is friends with Linda.

Richard tells Thomas they were attacked by a [[djinn]] and that the djinn can possess inanimate objects. Thomas believes he must wake Rose in order to break the curse. They hired Daniel (James Adam Lim), an acquaintance of Linda to decipher the book found in Kaiser Gardens. Billings returns to the property and is killed by The Veiled Demon. They discover that the family curse dates back to the [[Crusades]] and a djinn put Rose in eternal sleep. The group deduces that [[Iblis]] wants her and they must kill The Veiled Demon and awaken Rose.

Thomas, Linda and Richard return to Kaiser Gardens and open a second door behind the shrine room. Linda and Richard distract The Veiled Demon while Thomas finds and attempts to wake Rose. Unable to wake Rose with a kiss, Thomas uses his blood. Rose awakens then kisses and attacks Thomas. Rose kills The Veiled Demon, but before doing so The Veiled Demon tells them that Thomas' bloodline stores many demons which Rose will summon to unleash upon the world. Rose states she will not kill them so they can see the darkness to come and begins to awaken the demons in Thomas' bloodline. Meanwhile, after the full text from the book is deciphered Daniel reads the curse that awakening the demons in Thomas' bloodline will trigger the [[Apocalypse]].
