==Plot==
Le Rong/Yezi is being chased by her uncles & aunties down to the river and then being drowned by them. Next scenes have Yezi sweeping the floor in a hair saloon, being asked to pay the two months overdue rental for her lodging, and being asked by Zijun to play the role of Le Rong because of her resemblance to Le Rong. Yezi decided to do it after the hair saloon she worked in closes down. From here on the plot thickens with Yezi's sanity becoming unstable intermixing with hallucinations and reality. Coming to the end of the movie it is revealed that Yezi is actually Le Rong who is undergoing psychiatric treatment with her uncle Le Zijun. The movie ended with a closeup shot of a message left by Le Rong written in red ink.
