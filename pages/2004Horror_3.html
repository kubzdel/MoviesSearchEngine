The [[Horror Channel]] summarizes the plot as "In the darkest depths of secluded woodlands, a young group of friends head out for fun and frolics.

Another said "If you love mindless slashers where the plot is so simple [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] could figure it out in record time, and the kids are dumber than the norm, then check out "Adam and Evil". Trust me you will not be disappointed".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/scary/horror9/AdamandEvilreview.html

Referring to the U.K. title, Andrew Smith says "devoid of everything that makes this genre such a predictably entertaining time, you'll want to die faster if you are unlucky enough to sit down to watch".<ref>{{cite web
