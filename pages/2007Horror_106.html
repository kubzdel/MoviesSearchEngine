==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries range between 400-700 words. Please be aware that all edits and adding detail to this section are logged and reviewed. Thank you. -->
Over one hundred years ago, the devil  [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]] sent his [[bounty hunter]] of the damned, the [[Ghost Rider]], to retrieve a document known as the contract of San Venganza, a list of a thousand corrupt [[soul]]s. Seeing that the contract would give Mephistopheles the power to unleash [[hell]] on [[Earth]], the rider refuses to give him the contract.

In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old stunt motorcycle rider [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Blaze's soul, an offer he hastily accepts. The next morning, Blaze awakes to discover that his father's cancer is cured, but he is killed that same day in a motorcycle stunt in which he falls into the ring of fire through which he jumps. Blaze accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers their contract to be fulfilled and promises to one day see him again.

21 years later, Blaze has become a famous stunt motorcycle rider known for surviving numerous deadly crashes. Blaze meets his lifelong sweetheart [[Roxanne Simpson]], now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his father's death. He convinces her to attend a dinner date. Meanwhile, [[Blackheart]], the demonic son of Mephistopheles, comes to Earth, along with three fallen angels who bonded with the elements air, earth, and water. They are tasked to find the lost contract of San Venganza. In response, Mephistopheles makes Blaze the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart, though he is also told he has no choice in the matter. Blaze is driven straight to the station on his first ride, where he transforms into the Ghost Rider and kills the earth angel, Gressil. He also saves a young girl from a mugger and incapacitates him with the penance stare (a power that allows the Ghost Rider to make any evil person experience all the pains they caused on their victims as long as the victims were good and not evil). The next day, he meets a man called the [[Caretaker (comics)|caretaker]], who seems to know all about the history of the Ghost Rider. He tells him everything that happened was not a dream and that it will happen again, especially at night when he is near an evil soul.

When he arrives home, Blaze finds Simpson and reveals himself as the devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After a brief imprisonment for the murders that Blackheart committed, Blaze kills the air angel, Abigor, and escapes from the police before returning to the caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor, [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade]], a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] who hid the contract of San Venganza. Blaze returns home to find that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and has taken Roxanne captive, threatening to kill her if Blaze does not deliver the contract. Blaze tries to use the penance stare on Blackheart, but it does not to work as Blackheart has no soul to burn.

Blaze returns to the caretaker, who reveals himself as Carter Slade, and obtains the contract. Slade tells Blaze that he is more powerful than his predecessors since he sold his soul for love as opposed to greed. Slade leads Blaze to San Venganza, then gives Blaze a lever-action shotgun before fading away.

After killing the water angel Wallow, Blaze gives the contract to Blackheart. He quickly transforms into Ghost Rider in an effort to subdue Blackheart, but dawn arrives and he is rendered powerless. Blackheart uses the contract to [[Legion (demon)|absorb the thousand souls into his body]]. He attempts to kill Blaze, but is distracted when Simpson uses Blaze's discarded shotgun to separate them. After Blaze tries to kill Blackheart with the shotgun, he moves in and uses his penance stare to render him catatonic, burning all the corrupt souls within Blackheart, which is what he had hoped for.

Mephistopheles appears and returns Blaze his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to make another deal, Blaze declines, saying that he will use his power against him, and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated for being robbed of the power, Mephistopheles vows to make Blaze pay, but Blaze tells Mephistopheles that he is not afraid. Mephistopheles then disappears, taking Blackheart's body with him. Later, Simpson tells Blaze that he got his second chance before sharing a final kiss with him. Blaze then rides away on his motorcycle, turning into the Ghost Rider.

=== Development ===
[[Marvel Studio]] began development for ''Ghost Rider'' as early as 1992 and were in discussions with potential distributors.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|url=https://variety.com/1992/film/news/marvel-characters-holding-attraction-for-filmmakers-101955/|title=Marvel characters holding attraction for filmmakers|work=Variety|date=1992-12-08|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> In 1997 [[Gale Anne Hurd]] was listed as producer, with [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] attached to write the script.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/a-mania-for-marvel-1117434784/|title=A Mania for Marvel|work=Variety|date=1997-04-14|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> [[David S. Goyer]] developed a script and in May 2000 Marvel announced an agreement with Crystal Sky Entertainment to film ''Ghost Rider'' with actor [[Jon Voight]] attached as a producer.  Production was scheduled to start in early 2001 with a budget of $75 million and [[Johnny Depp]] expressing interest in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Sangiacomo | url= | title=More Marvel heroes to join X-Men on film over next few years | publisher=''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' | date=2000-05-25 | accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> The following August, [[Dimension Films]] joined Crystal Sky to co-finance the film, which would be directed by [[Stephen Norrington]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117785776.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title='Ghost' adds a Dimension | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2000-08-30 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> Producer [[Avi Arad]] approached [[Eric Bana]] on the possibility of playing Ghost Rider, but opted to cast him in ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' instead.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Fleming|url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/aussie-has-bulk-for-hulk-1117854264/|title=Aussie has bulk for ‘Hulk’|date=2001-10-14|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref> In June 2001, actor and Ghost Rider fan [[Nicolas Cage]] entered talks to be cast into the lead role,<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title=Cage considers 'Ghost Rider' role | publisher=''[[Erie Times-News]]'' | date=2001-06-28|accessdate=2006-12-22}}</ref> after having found out about Depp being a possibility for the role and contacted the director to express his own interest.<ref>{{cite news | author=Julia Brinksneader | url= | title=Another 'ER' casualty | publisher=''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' | date=2001-07-31 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> Norrington would drop out within a few months due his commitment to ''Tick Tock''<ref>{{cite news | author=James Berkshire | url= | title=Cage GHOST RIDER Burning Out? | publisher=Cinescape | date=2001-08-20 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> and Cage eventually left the project as well.  By May 2002 [[Columbia Pictures]] sought to acquire rights to ''Ghost Rider'' in [[turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] from Dimension Films following their success with ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title=`Ghost Rider' could follow Spidey film | publisher=''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' | date=2002-05-24 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> They brought [[Shane Salerno]] to rewrite Goyer's script.<ref>{{cite news|author=Charles Lyons; Claude Brodesser|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/news/sony-gallops-to-rein-in-all-rider-rights-1117867361/|title=Sony gallops to rein in all ‘Rider’ rights|work=Variety|date=2002-05-21|accessdate=2014-10-12}}</ref>

In April 2003, under Columbia Pictures, director [[Mark Steven Johnson]] took over the helm for ''Ghost Rider'' with Cage returning for the lead role. Johnson, rewriting Salerno's script, was set to begin production of ''Ghost Rider'' in late 2003 or early 2004.<ref>{{cite news | author=Dana Harris | url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=story&articleid=VR1117884327&categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Johnson sees 'Ghost' | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2003-04-08 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  but it was delayed to October 2003. Cage took a temporary leave of absence to film ''[[The Weather Man]]''.  ''Ghost Rider'' production was slated to tentatively begin in May or June 2004.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=287 | title=When May ''Ghost Rider'' Start Shooting? | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2003-10-19 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>

''Ghost Rider'' had again been delayed to begin in late 2004, but the lack of a workable script continued to delay production.<ref>{{cite news | author=Angela Dawson | url= | title=Nicolas Cage likes to hunt for treasure | publisher=''[[The Cincinnati Post]]'' | date=2004-11-18 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  In January 2005, actor [[Wes Bentley]] was cast as the villain [[Blackheart]], having been introduced to Johnson by [[Colin Farrell]], who had worked with the director in ''[[Daredevil (film)|Daredevil]]''.<ref>{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming |author2=Nicole Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117916685.html?categoryid=1238&cs=1 | title=Bentley to haunt 'Ghost' | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2005-01-20 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  Actress [[Eva Mendes]] was also cast opposite Cage as [[Roxanne Simpson]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Pamela McClintock | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117918741.html?categoryid=1350&cs=1 | title=Marvel to prime pupils | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2005-03-01 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  On February 14, 2005, ''Ghost Rider'' commenced filming in Australia at the [[Melbourne Docklands#Docklands Studios Melbourne|Melbourne Docklands film studios]].<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/02/13/1108229854265.html | title=More than a name | publisher=''[[The Age]]'' | date=2005-02-14 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  Then in March 2005, actor [[Peter Fonda]] (who starred in ''[[Easy Rider]]'') was cast as the villain [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Colin Covert | url= | title=The bounce – who's up – who's down | publisher=''[[Star Tribune]]'' | date=2005-03-11 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref>  Johnson originally planned to film before an audience at the [[Docklands Stadium|Telstra Dome]], but instead opted to create a crowd using computer-generated imagery.<ref>{{cite news | author=Clint Morris | url=http://www.moviehole.net/news/5161.html  | title=Ghost Rider skips Dome | publisher=Moviehole.net | date=2005-03-03 | accessdate=2007-01-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227084857/http://www.moviehole.net/news/5161.html |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}</ref>  The director also chose to film in the motorcycle district of [[Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Karl Quinn | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Film/Foreign-film-upturn-a-tale-of-two-cities/2005/03/05/1109958155904.html | title=Foreign film upturn a tale of two cities | publisher=''[[The Age]]'' | date=2005-03-06 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  By June 2005, principal photography had been completed for ''Ghost Rider'',<ref>{{cite news | author= | url= | title='Time Share' comedy | publisher=''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'' | date=2005-06-13 | accessdate= }}</ref> which was set for a summer 2006 release.<ref>{{cite news | author=Mike Musgrove | url= | title=Marvel, DC Duel At the Box Office | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2005-06-25 | accessdate=2006-12-22 }}</ref> In April 2006, the cast and crew performed last-minute reshoots in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=4083 | title=''Ghost Rider'' Reshoots in Vancouver | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2006-04-13 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  ''Ghost Rider'' was originally scheduled to release on August 4, 2006,<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/punishernews.php?id=3027 | title=Marvel Studios' Avi Arad on Upcoming Projects | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-05-18 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref> but the date was moved three weeks earlier to July 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=3455 | title=''Ghost Rider'' Moved Up to July | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-09-05 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  Sony changed the film's release date once more to February 16, 2007 to help relieve the studio's crowded 2006 calendar.<ref>{{cite news | first=Nicole | last=Laporte | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117934651?categoryid=1350&cs=1 | title=Sony cycles Cage starrer to 2007 | publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' | date=2005-12-14 | accessdate=2006-07-30 }}</ref>

===Character portrayal===
Instead of a "hard drinking and smoking bad ass" Johnny Blaze, Nicolas Cage decided to give him more depth.  "I'm playing him more as someone who... made this deal and he's trying to avoid confronting it, anything he can do to keep it away from him". Cage also explained that Blaze's stunt riding was a form of escape and a way to keep him connected to his deceased father, who taught him to ride.  Cage rode a [[Buell Motorcycle Company|Buell]] motorcycle for Blaze's stunt cycle, and a heavily customized hardtail chopper named "Grace" which transforms into the "Hell Cycle".<ref>{{cite news | author=Andrew Weil | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=3153 | title=SET VISIT: Nicolas Cage on ''Ghost Rider''! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-06-16 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>  The Hell Cycle's wheels, made of pure flames in the comics, were changed to be solid tires covered in flames in order to give the motorcycle more weight onscreen.<ref name="comic con">{{cite news | author=Scott Chitwood | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=3304 | title= The ''Ghost Rider'' Panel at Comic-Con | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-07-17 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>

The film's visual effects supervisor, [[Kevin Mack (visual effects artist)|Kevin Mack]], and the visual effects team at [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] handled the difficult task of creating computer-generated fire on a shot-by-shot basis.<ref name="msj" />  Ghost Rider's [[human skull|skull]] flames were designed to become smaller and [[blue]] to display any [[emotion]] other than rage.<ref name="comic con" />  Kevin's Team at Imageworks also created computer-generated motorcycles, chains, water, black goo, dementors and buildings. To pull off such effects as the living morph where the hardtail chopper ("Grace") comes alive to become the "Hell Cycle" Sony enlisted teams of animators, models, effects artists, lighters & "Flame" artists. The department supervisors for these teams at Imageworks included Kevin Hudson, Brian Steiner, JD Cowels, Marco Marenghi, Joe Spadaro, Joanie Karnowski, Vincent Serritella & Patrick Witting. Patrick's team bore the brunt of the work as they created the fire using a custom pipeline that automated the set up starting with Maya animated geometry driving Maya Fluids, imported into Houdini and then rendered & composited on top of the live action plates. Patrick and his team set up the fire process and much of the front end automation was set up by Scott Palleiko and Joe Spadaro. The fire was then tweaked and manipulated to look and move believably by Patick's eleven man Houdini effects team. All of this was enabled by effects producers Daniel Kuehn and the Digital Effects Supervisor Kee-Suk 'Ken' Hahn.

The digital version of the hell cycle was modeled in detail by Kevin Hudson and based on the practical prop used in the film, it included animatable skeletal hands that came alive to wrap the gas tank during the supernatural transformation scene. The transformation scene was animated by Max Tyrie and finalized by Joe Spadaro. Each part of the "Grace" geometry had to match up and morph with a piece of geometry on the "Hell Cycle"

The bullet time like scene where Ghost Rider on the "Hell Cycle" jumps from a building cutting to slow motion with the flaming chain was the brainchild of animator Maks Naporowski. [[Kevin Mack (visual effects artist)|Kevin Mack]], was looking for what he called "shoe leather" to tie the two scenes together. Maks & Marco came up with this incredible concept that went on to become one of the most impressive scenes in the film & on the trailers.

Ghost Rider's voice was manipulated by sound designer [[Dane Davis]], who won an [[Academy Award for Sound Editing]] for ''[[The Matrix]]''.  Davis filtered Cage's line readings through three different kinds of animal growls that were played backwards and covered separate frequencies.  Davis then amplified the dialogue through a mechanical volumizer.  Director Johnson described the sound as a "deep, demonic, mechanical lion's roar".<ref>{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/ghostridernews.php?id=3374 | title=Mark Steven Johnson on ''Ghost Rider''! | publisher=SuperHeroHype.com | date=2005-08-07 | accessdate=2007-01-29 }}</ref>
