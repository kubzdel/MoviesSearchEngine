==Plot==
{{Cleanup-rewrite|2=section|date=July 2016}}

Movie evolves around Michael Wolffsen (Tyler Mane) who is engaged to Juliette (Renae Geerlings), and both take care of teenager Brandon (Alex Saxon). The teenager is Michael's nephew, the son of his sister Chloe (Susan Angelo) who has died.

After a call from Michael and Chloe's father Gary (Muse Watson), the trio arrive to the family estate to meet him and learn that he has dementia and is losing his mind. Gary's new wife Annabelle (Leslie Brooks) takes care of him, but has decided to leave him because he was abusive and beat her.

Things turn dark after an obscure presence arrives with them and start chasing them. Odd accidents and curious wounds happen. Gary tries to warn them, but because of his dementia nobody believes him, and don't trust them. 
We learn that Michael had shot and killed William, his brother-in-law and Brandon's dad, after William stabbed Chloe when she attempted to leave him and move in with Michael and Juliette.
Gary is surprised to know that William's ghost is there because only those with Nordic mark carved on their skin for a passage ritual can stay linge in the place the ritual has been done.
Soon the group discovers that Chloe had carved the rune into her family years ago before William became abusive. Annabelle walks away from protection and is murdered by the ghost, with her niece.
A pair of cops who come to check the estate also are taken and savagely killed by ghost William, who is furious and seeking revenge against those who had taken his life.
A battle against William starts, as they try to undo the bond done by Chloe and banish him, once William breaks the spiritual defences in the house.
Gary does the only thing he think can do to fight him and takes his life, giving the opportunity to Michael to banish William.
After the bitter triumph the surviving trio leave the estate.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125472/</ref>
