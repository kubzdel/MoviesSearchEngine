==Plot==
Tok Wan Rimau ([[Azean Irdawaty]]), the custodian of the [[Werecat|spiritual tiger]], is searching for a female heir to inherit her powers. Tina (Maya Karin) and Ari (Rusdi Ramli) are the relatives of Tok Wan. They are also best friends. Tok Wan's spiritual tiger protects her family and their village from harm. Tina, who is in love with Ari, nurtures her secret dream of marrying him even though the villagers often ridicule the effeminate Ari as a sissy. Deeply traumatised by these insults, Ari continues to hide behind his close relationship with Tina. Despite parental objections, Tina seems destined to be the next in line as custodian of the mystical tiger. But Ari steps in, offering himself instead.

== Production ==
Filming had been done in several locations namely Kuala Lumpur and the states of [[Pahang]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]]; the latter state being the origin of the myth of the were-tiger in which the film revolves around.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mstar.com.my/artikel/?file=/2006/11/20/HIBURAN/m_Aduh/Waris_Jari_Hantu_kenangan_Shumi_untuk_sahabat|title=Waris Jari Hantu kenangan Shumi untuk sahabat|last=Radin Sri Ghazali|first=|date=20 November 2006|website=mStar|publisher=2016 Star Media Group Berhad|language=Malay|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref>
