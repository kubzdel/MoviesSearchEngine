'''''Let the Right One In''''' ({{lang-sv|Låt den rätte komma in}}) is a 2008 Swedish [[Romance film|romantic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Tomas Alfredson]], based on the 2004 [[Let the Right One In (novel)|novel of the same title]] by [[John Ajvide Lindqvist]], who also wrote the screenplay. The film tells the story of a bullied 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a [[vampire]] child in [[Blackeberg]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]], in the early 1980s. Alfredson, unconcerned with the [[Horror film|horror]] and [[Vampire films|vampire conventions]], decided to tone down many elements of the novel and focus primarily on the relationship between the two main characters. Selecting the lead actors involved a year-long process with open castings held all over Sweden. In the end, the 11-year-olds [[Kåre Hedebrant]] and [[Lina Leandersson]] were chosen for the leading roles. They were subsequently commended by both Alfredson and film reviewers for their performances.

The film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature" at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and the [[European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation]]'s 2008 Méliès d'Or (Golden [[Georges Méliès|Méliès]]) for the "Best European Fantastic Feature Film", as well as four [[Guldbagge Award]]s from the [[Swedish Film Institute]] and the [[Saturn Award for Best International Film]].

==Plot==
<!--Eli's gender is intentionally ambiguous. See the talk page before attempting to correct this.-->
Oskar, a meek 12-year-old boy, resides with his mother Yvonne in the western Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg in 1981 and occasionally visits his father Erik in the countryside. During one such visit to his father, when Oskar and Erik are enjoying a cosy night playing games, a drunken neighbour arrives, and Erik starts to drink heavily with him, breaking up the father/son evening.

Oskar's classmates regularly [[Bullying|bully]] him, and he spends his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from newspapers and magazines about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, who appears to be a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his [[Rubik's Cube]] to Eli, and the two exchanging [[Morse code]] messages through their adjoining wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him to stand up for himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.

Earlier, Håkan stops and kills a passerby on a busy footpath near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making his way home from a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated [[hydrochloric acid]] onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to "go steady". While Eli states, "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.

During an ice skating [[field trip]] at the lake, some of Oskar's fellow students discover Jocke's body. At the same time, Oskar finally stands up to his tormentors and strikes the leader of the bullies, Conny, on the side of the head with a pole, splitting his ear. Some time later, Oskar shows Eli a private place he knows. Unaware that Eli is a vampire, Oskar suggests that they form a [[Blood brother|blood bond]], and cuts his hand, asking Eli to do the same. Eli, thirsting for blood but not wanting to harm Oskar, laps up his spilled blood before running away. Lacke's girlfriend, Virginia, is subsequently attacked by Eli. Lacke turns up in time to interrupt the attack. Virginia survives, but soon discovers that she has become painfully sensitive to sunlight. Seeking Lacke, Virginia visits Gösta, only to be fiercely attacked by Gösta's cats. In the hospital, Virginia, who has realized what she has become, asks an orderly to open the blinds in her room. When the sunlight streams in, she bursts into flames.

On realizing Eli's true nature, Oskar confronts Eli, who admits to being a vampire. Oskar is initially upset by Eli's need to kill people for survival. However, Eli insists that their bloodthirsty natures are alike, in that Oskar wants to kill and Eli needs to kill, and encourages Oskar to "be me, for a little while."

Lacke, who has lost everything because of Eli, tracks Eli down to the closed-off apartment. Breaking in, he discovers Eli asleep in the bathtub. He prepares to kill her, but Oskar, who was hiding inside the apartment, interferes; Eli immediately wakes up, jumps on Lacke and kills him, feeding on his blood. Eli thanks Oskar and kisses him in gratitude. However, an upstairs neighbor is angrily knocking on the ceiling due to the disturbance the fight has caused. Eli realizes that it is no longer safe to stay and leaves the same night.

The next morning, Oskar receives a phone call from Conny's friend, Martin, who lures Oskar out to resume the after-school fitness program at the local swimming pool. The bullies, led by Conny and his [[wikt:sadism|sadistic]] older brother Jimmy, start a fire to draw Mr Ávila, the teacher in charge, outside, and enter the pool area, ordering the other children to clear out. This leaves Oskar trapped alone in the pool. Jimmy forces Oskar under the water, threatening to stab his eye out if he does not hold his breath for three minutes. While Oskar is being held underwater, Eli arrives and rescues him by killing and dismembering the bullies, except for the most reluctant of their number, Andreas, who is left sobbing on a bench.

Later, Oskar is traveling on a train with Eli in a box beside him, safe from sunlight. From inside, Eli taps the word "kiss" to Oskar in Morse code, to which he taps back "''puss''" (small kiss in Swedish).

===Development===
[[File:Blackeberg Subway.jpg|thumb|right|The characteristic subway station of [[Blackeberg]], which features in the film]]
The film project started in late 2004 when John Nordling, a producer at the production company EFTI, contacted [[John Ajvide Lindqvist|Ajvide Lindqvist]]'s publisher [[Ordfront]] to acquire the rights for a film adaptation of his novel, ''[[Let the Right One In (novel)|Let the Right One In]]'': "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist and it turned out we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation".<ref name="flerbocker">{{cite web|last=Ivarsson|first=Torbjörn|date=8 July 2007|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/allt-fler-bocker-blir-film/|title=Allt fler böcker blir film|language=Swedish|work=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|accessdate=2009-03-06|url-access=subscription}}</ref> A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel.<ref name="kärv">{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.se/noje/tomas-alfredson-om-nya-filmen-br-skildringen-ar-oerhort-karv(958320).gm |title=Tomas Alfredson om nya filmen: "Skildringen är oerhört kärv" |last=Melin |first=Inger |date=7 November 2008|work=[[Borås Tidning]]|language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927183609/http://www.bt.se/noje/tomas-alfredson-om-nya-filmen-br-skildringen-ar-oerhort-karv%28958320%29.gm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df= }}</ref> While he normally does not like to receive books, because "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it.<ref name="shock">{{cite web | url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8113#| title = 'Shock Till You Drop' Exclusive: Tomas Alfredson ''Lets the Right One In''|last=Douglas|first=Edward | date =19 October 2008|work=[[ComingSoon.net|ComingSoon]]|accessdate = 2009-07-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021002518/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8113|archivedate=21 October 2008}}</ref> The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply.

===Screenplay===
Lindqvist had insisted on writing the screenplay himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/film/film-reviews/let-the-right-one-in/2009/03/18/1237054900543.html| title = Let The Right One In|last=Cockrell|first=Eddie | date = 18 March 2009| work =[[Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate = 2009-05-09 }}</ref> initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying.<ref name="shock"/> Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads.<ref name="JAL">{{cite web|work=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38839|title=The Northlander Sits Down With The Writer Of 'Let the Right One In'!|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=23 October 2008|author=Moriarty}}</ref><ref name="huffington">{{cite web | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karin-badt/emlet-the-right-one-inem_b_147966.html| title = Let the Right One In: New Vampire Film with a 'Beat'|last=Badt|first=Karin | date =3 December 2008| work =[[HuffPost]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}</ref><ref name="tomas_sfi">{{cite web|url=http://sfi.se/PageFiles/8169/L%C3%85TDENR%C3%84TTE_INTERVJU.pdf |title=Tomas&nbsp;— Den rätte |last=Lagerström |first=Louise |year=2008 |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |page=5 |language=Swedish |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827022413/http://sfi.se/PageFiles/8169/L%C3%85TDENR%C3%84TTE_INTERVJU.pdf |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In particular, many aspects of the character Håkan, including him being a [[paedophile]], were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship.<ref name="tomas_sfi" /> Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).

A key passage in the novel details what happens when a vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that traditional [[Vampire|vampire lore]] usually prohibits.<ref name="bradshaw">{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review| title = Film Review: Let the Right One In|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter | date =10 April 2009| work =[[The Guardian]]| accessdate = 2009-05-09 }}</ref> Alfredson originally wanted to omit this from the film, but Ajvide Lindqvist was adamant that it had to be included.<ref name="tomas_sfi" /> Alfredson was initially nervous about the scene.

The novel presents Eli as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] boy, [[Castration|castrated]] centuries before by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles the issue of Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers a glimpse of a suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration.<ref name="tomas_sfi" /> When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress [[Elif Ceylan]]. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut.<ref name="TA">{{cite web|work=Ain't It Cool News|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38870|title=Moriarty Sits Down With Tomas Alfredson, Director Of 'Let the Right One In'!|date=26 October 2008|accessdate=26 October 2008|author=Moriarty}}</ref> In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation.

===Casting and filming===
Casting of the lead actors took almost a year,<ref name="explodera">{{cite web|last=Andersson|first=Jan-Olov|date=21 December 2008|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/article4044828.ab|title=Jag var nära att explodera|language= Swedish|work=[[Aftonbladet]]|archivedate=26 March 2009|accessdate=21 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="twitch_nifff">{{cite web | url = http://twitchfilm.net/site/view/nifff-2008-let-the-right-one-in-interview/| title = NIFFF 2008 – 'Let the Right One In' Interview|author=Blake| work =[[Screen Anarchy|Twitch]] | date=24 July 2008|accessdate = 2009-03-06 }}</ref> with open castings held all over [[Sweden]].

Alfredson has described the casting process as the most difficult part of making the film.<ref name="explodera" /> He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads,<ref name="latimes" /> and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to look.<ref name="alltomfilm">{{cite web | url = http://www.alltomfilm.se/ArticlePages/200810/24/20081024135429_DVD137/20081024135429_DVD137.dbp.asp| title = Intervju med regissören Thomas Alfredsson|last=Bjurvald|first=Anton | date = 24 October 2008| publisher =Allt om film|language=Swedish | accessdate = 2009-03-14 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two sides of the same coin."<ref name="tomas_sfi" /> On another occasion, Alfredson stated that "[c]asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together."<ref name="huffington" /> In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being "extremely intelligent",<ref name="twitch_nifff" /> "incredibly wise",<ref name="alltomfilm" /> and "unprecedentedly fantastic."<ref name="twitch_nifff" />

[[File:Lack of ceiling cropped.jpg|thumb|left|The absence of ceilings made various overhead lighting techniques possible.]]
Although the film takes place in [[Blackeberg]], a suburb of [[Stockholm]], principal photography took place in [[Luleå]] (in the north of Sweden) to ensure enough snow and cold weather. The area where the filming took place dated from around the same time as Blackeberg, and has similar architecture.<ref name="JAL" /> However, Alfredson shot a few scenes in the Blackeberg area. In particular, the scene where Eli leaps down on Virginia from a tree, was shot in the town square of Blackeberg.<ref name="DVD" /> Another scene, where Eli attacks Jocke in an underpass, was shot in the nearby suburb of [[Råcksta]].<ref name="JAL" /> The original Blackeberg underpass that Lindqvist had envisioned was deemed too high to fit in the picture.<ref name="DVD" /> Some of the outdoor close-up scenes were made in a super cold studio.<ref name="filmthreat">{{cite web | url = http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1215/| title = Frost Bite: Director Tomas Alfredson on "Let the Right One In" | date = 2008-10-22| publisher =[[Film Threat]] }}</ref> The [[jungle gym]] where much of the interaction between Oskar and Eli takes place was constructed specifically for the film.<ref name="TA" /> Its design was intended to suit the [[CinemaScope]] format<ref name="TA" /> better than a regular jungle gym, which would typically have to be cropped height-wise.<ref name="DVD" />

Most of the filming used a single, fixed, [[Arriflex 535|Arri 535B]] camera, with almost no [[Handheld camera|handheld]] usage, and few cuts. Tracking shots relied on a track-mounted [[Camera dolly|dolly]], rather than [[Steadicam]], to create calm, predictable camera movement.<ref name="asc">{{cite web | url = http://www.ascmag.com/ac_magazine/December2008/LettheRightOneIn/page1.php| title = An Unusual Romance|last=Hemphill|first=Jim| work =[[American Cinematographer]]| publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]]|accessdate = 2010-09-24|date=December 2008}}</ref> The crew paid special attention to lighting. Cinematographer [[Hoyte van Hoytema]] and director Alfredson invented a technique they called "spray light". In an interview, van Hoytema describes it as follows: "If you could capture dull electrical light in a can and spray it like hairspray across Eli’s apartment, it would have the same result as what we created". For the emotional scenes between Oskar and Eli, van Hoytema consistently [[Soft light|diffused]] the lighting.<ref name="asc" />

===Post-production===
The film contains around fifty shots with [[computer-generated imagery]]. Alfredson wanted to make them very subtle and almost unnoticeable.<ref name="TA" /> The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, one of the most complicated scenes to film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.<ref name="DVD"/>

The film features analogue sound-effects exclusively throughout.<ref name="twitch_nifff"/> The lead sound-designer Per Sundström explained: "The key to good sound effects is working with natural and real sounds.(...) These analogue sounds can be digitally reworked as much as necessary, but the origin has to be natural".<ref name="alfredsonMF"/> Sundström designed the [[soundscape]] to come as close to the actors as possible, with audible heartbeats, breathing, and swallowing.

The details surrounding the film's eligibility for the award resulted in some confusion.<ref name="sfi_oscar">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2009/Darforvar-Lat-den-ratte-inte-valbar/ |title=Därför var "Låt den rätte" inte valbar |language=Swedish |last=Zillén |first=Fredrik |date=16 September 2009|work=Filmnyheterna |publisher=Swedish Film Institute|accessdate=2010-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008225403/http://www.filmnyheterna.se/en/Arkiverade-nyheter/Nyheter/2009/Darforvar-Lat-den-ratte-inte-valbar/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Being released on 24 October 2008, the film would normally be eligible for submission for the [[82nd Academy Awards]]. However, the producers decided to release it on 24 September as a seven-day limited run only in [[Luleå]]. This would be exactly enough to meet the criteria for the [[81st Academy Awards]] instead.<ref name="sfi_oscar"/> When the Swedish Film Institute on 16 September announced that [[Jan Troell]]'s ''[[Everlasting Moments]]'' had been selected instead of ''Let the Right One In'', the Luleå screenings were cancelled. Despite the fact that the film was released within the eligibility period for the 82nd Academy Awards, it wasn't among the films considered because the Swedish Film Institute doesn't allow a film to be considered twice.<ref name="sfi_oscar"/>
