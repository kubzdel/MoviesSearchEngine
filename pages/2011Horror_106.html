'''''Marianne''''' is a 2011 Swedish [[horror film]], written and directed by [[Filip Tegstedt]], that premiered at the [[Fantasia Festival|2011 Fantasia International Film Festival]] on 2 August 2011.<ref name=screen/>  [[Thomas Hedengran]] plays a father who is plagued by guilt over the death of his wife.

== Plot ==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
The film is set in the town of [[Östersund]], in the [[Jämtland]] region to the north of Sweden, and focuses on the mental state of Krister, a man who is left to raise a newborn baby whilst coping with a teenage daughter who blames him for the recent death of his wife.  In the midst of his psychological turmoil, Krister suffers from terrible nightmares and becomes convinced that his troubles may be the work of a [[Mare (folklore)|Mare]] that is haunting him.

== Cast ==
*[[Thomas Hedengran]] as Krister, a teacher who begins to experience strange nightmares while trying to redeem his relationship with his daughter Sandra.
*[[Dylan M. Johansson]] as Stiff, the pothead older boyfriend of Sandra who has an intense interest in Swedish Folklore. 
*[[Peter Stormare]] as Sven, the therapist that Krister sees to help resolve his nightmares.
*[[Tintin Anderzon]] as Eva, the wife of Krister and the mother of Sandra.
*[[Viktoria Sätter]] as Marianne, the titular creature of Nordic Folklore whom Stiff believes is responsible for Krister's nightmares.
*Sandra Larsson as Sandra, the daughter of Krister and Eva who resents her father for cheating on her Mother.

== Production ==
[[Filip Tegstedt]] has commented in numerous interviews that he wanted to make a film that explores Swedish folklore surrounding the concept of the Mare, traditionally thought to be responsible for the contemporary medical phenomenon of [[sleep paralysis]]. This is a condition where patients report waking up paralyzed, unable to move, whilst feeling a presence in the room like someone is watching them. The paralysis often comes with the sense of a heavy weight on their chest that makes it difficult to breathe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://lesgivresdlabobine.wordpress.com/2010/12/13/entretien-avec-le-realisateur-filip-tegstedt-a-propos-de-marianne/&ei=BLVqTaK9D4nQceTO_Y0M&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CEAQ7gEwBg|title=Interview with director Filip Tegstedt, about 'Marianne' |first=Aurore|last=Bjursell|date=13 December 2010|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>{{self-published-inline|date=January 2014}}

Contributing to the development of this film was a reaction against the funding priorities of the [[Swedish Film Institute]]. Tegstedt has remarked that part of the reason why there are no good horror films in Sweden is that horror films are seen to be, culturally speaking, a lower class of film, less deserving of funding. In reaction to this perceived genre hierarchy, Tegstedt decided to liquidate all his assets in order to finance the production of ''Marianne'' and take a high interest loan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2011/12/the-northlander-talking-to-marianne-director-filip-tegstedt.html|title=The Northlander: talking to MARIANNE director Filip Tegstedt|last=Lee|first=Matthew|work=[[Twitch Film]]|date=18 December 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref>

While other producers also offered to finance his debut feature, they were only willing to do this on the condition that ''Marianne'' was filmed in [[Stockholm]]. Filip felt that a key part of the story was the northern location of [[Östersund]], and the fact that it was his hometown, and that he wanted the film to be as authentic to his vision as possible.<ref name=screen/>

== Release ==
Tegstedt has remarked that the marketing strategy depends on getting press and acceptance in film festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenread.de/filip-tegstedt-marianne-swedish-horror-interview-english/|title=Independent Swedish Horror: Filip Tegstedt talks MARIANNE Interview (english version)|date=22 March 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The film premiered at [[Fantasia International Film Festival]] on 2 August 2011.<ref name=screen/>

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
''Marianne'' has received positive reviews. Garry McConnachie of MCMBUZZ wrote that "director Tegstedt gets his character development spot on and his use of sound and visuals ensure viewers will be on the edge of their seats when it's required", and that "''Marianne'' is an extremely accomplished debut that will get under the skin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmbuzz.com/2011/07/29/movie-review-marianne/|title=Movie review: Marianne|first=Garry|last=McConnachie|date=29 July 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> Kurt Halfyard of [[Twitch Film]] described Marianne as "a film that subtly uses the language of domestic drama to craft a realistic and true horror film", and also stated that this  "is a brave thing to attempt with a first feature". Kurt Halfyard was so impressed that he added "Somebody, please, get [[Guillermo del Toro]] in contact with [[Filip Tegstedt]] because here is a young director with the chops to make a [[The Devil's Backbone]] or a [[Pan's Labyrinth]] if he were given the finances and freedom to do so.  In fact, he may well already have done the former with Marianne." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2011/07/fantasia-2011-marianne-review.php|title=Fantasia 2011: MARIANNE Review|first=Kurt|last=Halfyard|date=21 July 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>  Scott Weinberg of [[Fearnet]] wrote, "Although probably not recommended for the hardcore gorehounds, the creepy, insightful and effectively melancholy ''Marianne'' is a quiet little winner."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/fantasia-fest-2011-marianne-review|title=Fantasia Fest 2011: 'Marianne' Review|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[Fearnet]]|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref>  Michael Gingold of ''[[Fangoria]]'' wrote, "Tegstedt develops a sense of mystery and creeping fear that balance the sadness and make MARIANNE an absorbing viewing experience."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5286:marianne-fantasia-film-review&catid=119:fango-at-fantasia&Itemid=255 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814095910/http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5286%3Amarianne-fantasia-film-review&catid=119%3Afango-at-fantasia&Itemid=255 |archivedate=14 August 2011 |title="MARIANNE" (Fantasia Film Review |last=Gingold |first=Michael |work=[[Fangoria]] |date=2 August 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>
