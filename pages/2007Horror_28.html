'''''Blood & Chocolate''''' is a 2007 [[Fantasy film|fantasy]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Katja von Garnier]]. Written by [[Ehren Kruger]] and [[Christopher B. Landon]], it is loosely based on [[Annette Curtis Klause]]'s [[1997 in literature|1997]] [[young adult fiction|young adult]] [[Blood and Chocolate (novel)|novel of the same name]].

An [[international co-production]] between the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of Romania|Romania]] and the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]. ''Blood & Chocolate'' was both a commercial and critical failure.

==Plot==
Vivian ([[Agnes Bruckner]]) is a 19-year-old werewolf born in [[Bucharest, Romania]] to Romanian parents who emigrated to America. When Vivian was nine-years-old, her parents and two siblings were killed by two hunters who then burned down their house. She moved back to Bucharest to live with her aunt; Astrid ([[Katja Riemann]])who was at that time the mate of the pack's leader; Gabriel ([[Olivier Martinez]]). To Astrid's distress, Gabriel left her after seven years in accordance with pack law to choose a new mate. The culmination of another seven years is only a few months away and Gabriel wants the reluctant Vivian as his mate.

Vivian, however, begins a romance with a graphic novelist, Aiden ([[Hugh Dancy]]), who is researching his latest book. Although he is human, Aiden knows much about Vivian's kind, the Loups-Garoux (werewolves). Their romance is closely watched by her cousin Rafe ([[Bryan Dick]]) and his friends Ulf ([[Chris Geere]]), Gregor ([[Tom Harper (actor)|Tom Harper]]), Finn ([[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]]) and Willem (Jack Wilson), together known as The Five. Rafe sees a drawing that Aiden did of Vivian where she is referred to as "The Wolf Girl". Believing that she is telling Aiden all of their pack's secrets, and that she may grow to be a danger to the pack, Rafe tells Gabriel about Aiden. Gabriel then tells Rafe that Aiden must leave or he will be dealt with.

Rafe lures Aiden to an abandoned church with the ruse that Vivian wants to reconnect and attempts to scare him away. When this doesn't work, Rafe attacks Aiden, but Aiden defends himself and forces Rafe back into a table where he cuts himself. Aiden, who did not previously know what Vivian and her friends were, sees the golden glow of the Loups-Garoux and realizes that Vivian is one of them. The two fight, with Aiden attacking Rafe with a silver pendant and Rafe turning into a wolf. Aiden eventually gains the upper hand, killing Rafe.

Afterward, Aiden confronts Vivian about her true identity, tempting her with his blood. She did not give in but was hurt that Aiden would think that she is a monster. Not long after, Aiden is captured by the pack to answer for killing Rafe, who is revealed to be Gabriel's son. He was made to run through the forest while being chased by the pack. If the pack catches him, he dies. If he makes it to the river and crosses it, he lives. Vivian became scared for him, then she changed into her wolf form, a white wolf, to save him from the pack. Aiden made it to the river by confusing the pack, using his blood to spread his scent and made it harder for them to track him. Gabriel, however, was angry that Aiden made it to the river and attempts to follow him in order to kill him anyway. Vivian helped to protect Aiden by throwing Gabriel off his scent. Aiden, not realizing that the white wolf is Vivian, strikes her with a silver knife and she starts to bleed to death. Her only hope is getting an antidote in time.

After hiding from the pack, Aiden and Vivian found the pharmacist who has the antidote for the silver poisoning and they stole it from him, but not before the pharmacist calls the rest of the pack. After being chased, Vivian tells Aiden to save himself and was captured by the pack. She was held in a cage and taunted by the rest of The Five while Gabriel attempts to manipulate her to his way of thinking. Aiden came to Vivian's rescue and in the end Vivian has to kill Gabriel.

Aiden and Vivian drove away, past other Loups-Garous who bared their necks in respect to Vivian and Aiden, hinting that Vivian might possibly be the new leader of the pack.

==Production==
Since 1997, five directors, namely Larry Williams and his wife, [[Leslie Libman]], [[Po-Chih Leong]], [[Sanji Senaka]], and [[Rupert Wainwright]], were in talks to film ''Blood & Chocolate'' before Katja von Garnier finally decided in January 2005 to direct the film. The book was originally adapted into a script by [[Christopher B. Landon|Christopher Landon]], whose father, [[Michael Landon]], had a leading role in the film ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://katja-von-garnier.de/deutsch/film_blood_and_chocolate.htm | title = ''Blood and Chocolate'' at director's site (de icon) }}</ref>

Author [[Annette Curtis Klause]] was not kept up-to-date by the film's producers. She had to find information about filming on the web.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cynthialeitichsmith.blogspot.com/2006/01/author-update-annette-curtis-klause.html | title = Interview with author Annette Curtis Klause }}</ref>

[[Principal photography]] was set in the historic section of Bucharest and at [[MediaPro Studios]] in [[Buftea]]. However, like many of American films based in Bucharest, it failed to accurately represent real places in the city. For example, the [[Piata Romana]] (Romana Square) is actually the [[Curtea Veche]] yard (Old Court, a destroyed old palace), or Biserica Silvestru (Silvestru Church, in downtown Bucharest) is actually a church in Stirbey Palace, Buftea, a few tens of kilometres west of Bucharest.

==Variation from novel==
{{Essay|section|date=June 2018}}{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}{{copyedit|section=yes|date=June 2018}}
The film has significant differences from the plot and characters from [[Annette Curtis Klause]]'s [[1997 in literature|1997]] [[young adult fiction|young adult]] [[Blood and Chocolate (novel)|novel of the same name]]. This has led to criticism that the film should have changed its production name, as nothing was retained from Klause's novel other than character names.

The title of the film, "Blood & Chocolate", is derived from the conclusion of the novel:<blockquote>"He was raw and sharp and rich and throbbing with life. He was sweet blood after a long hunt. How could she have mistaken Aiden's kisses for this? They had been delicious and smooth like the brief comfort of chocolate, but they had never been enough."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blood and chocolate.|last=Klause|first=Annette Curtis|publisher=Delacorte Press|year=1997|isbn=0385734212|location=New York|pages=}}</ref></blockquote> In the film, Vivian and Aiden are portrayed as older than in the novel, and meet under different circumstances. Originally, they were both attending the same high school and Vivian sought Aiden out after reading a poem he wrote about werewolves. In the events of the novel, the pair starts to date despite the disapproval that Vivian receives from her mother and the pack. When she eventually reveals what she is to Aiden, he rejects her fearfully and later tries to kill Vivian with a silver bullet believing her to be a murderer.

Additionally, Gabriel in the film is portrayed as an aggressive antagonist ruling by force and fear. Originally in the novel, he is a new addition to the pack and wins his mantle of leadership in the Ordeal according to the Old Way. The relationship between Gabriel and Vivian in the novel is much more complex and vastly different than the relationship depicted in the film. Originally, Gabriel is interested in Vivian before he becomes alpha and Vivian unintentionally declares herself his mate and equal when she defends her mother from Astrid during the ritual of the Bitches Dance (the counterpart to the Ordeal by which Gabriel becomes alpha). Afterwards, Vivian declares she does not want to be alpha and continually rejects Gabriel, who despite this continually helps Vivian as she deals with her relationship with Aiden and its eventual fallout - comforting her on multiple occasions. When he comes to save Vivian from Astrid, Rafe and Aiden, he originally meant to spare the human boy out of love for Vivian, but when Vivian takes a bullet meant to kill Gabriel, he threatens Aiden with death if he comes back after any of them or spills the pack's secret to other humans. The novel ends with Gabriel and Vivian sharing a kiss and a run in their wolf forms, Vivian embraces her place as alpha female alongside Gabriel and her place as his mate.

The film depicts the nature of the Loups-Garoux very differently. The film portrays the pack as bloodthirsty and vengeful towards humans, seen hunting them down for sport on every full moon. In the film, Aiden is subject to this event due to his relationship with Vivian, whereas in the novel none of this occurs. The pack is also depicted of having a tradition where the alpha male takes a new mate every seven years, and Gabriel chooses Vivian to be his next mate after Astrid - again none of this occurs in the novel. Instead, an alpha male and female is decided by the Ordeal and The Bitches Dance, respectively. However, it is hinted that if a male is mated when he competes and wins in the Ordeal, his mate will be alpha female and no dance will occur.

It also omits their ability to maintain hybrid forms where they have both features of wolf and human. This is an important aspect as at the end of the conflict with Aiden, Vivian becomes stuck in this form until Gabriel comforts her and helps her overcome her fear and heartache, and achieve the ability to shift once again.

The general plot of the book is completely different from what occurs in the film. Vivian's background story is changed entirely, as well as the fate of her family. Also, at the start of the film, Astrid is shown as Gabriel's past mate and wife, they share a son - Rafe. In the book, Astrid is not alpha female at any point. She does try and gain the romantic interest of Gabriel and also attacks Esme in the Bitches Dance to win the right to be Gabriel's mate but is defeated by Vivian instead. Astrid is the main antagonist in the novel who seeks revenge on Vivian for winning the Dance and becoming Gabriel's mate. She seduces Rafe and gains his help in setting up Vivian to believe she had murdered a couple of humans during blackout episodes. None of this plot appears in the film and instead is recycled as the whole pack ritualistically hunting humans.
