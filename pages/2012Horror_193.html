The Pritchards' daughter, Diane, was supposedly dragged upstairs by her neck.<ref>{{cite news|title=Horror film's a real scream|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|location=Birmingham|date=16 September 2012|page=12|via=[[InfoTrac]]|first=Roz|last=Laws|accessdate=28 October 2016|url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A302490888/STND?sid=wikipedia|subscription=yes}}</ref> The incident was locally popular but "largely unknown elsewhere" until [[Colin Wilson]] wrote a book about it in 1981 that gained notoriety among paranormal aficionados. Director Pat Holden stated that he "embellished the story to make it fit it into a horror movie template".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news|last=Applebaum|first=Steven|title=A ghost in the house|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/30/a-ghost-in-the-house|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC1>{{cite news|last=Youngs|first=Ian|title=When the Lights Went Out revives 1970s ghost story|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19541877|work=[[BBC News]]|date=11 September 2012|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>
