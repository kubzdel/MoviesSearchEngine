==Production==
===Development===
Initially a fourth film, entitled ''Outbreak'', was planned with the story taking place on a [[cruise ship]].<ref name="Rejectsprod">{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Samantha|title=‘CABIN FEVER’ REMAKE IS HAPPENING; AND YES, WE’RE SURE IT’S NOT ANOTHER DVD SEQUEL|url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/news/cabin-fever-remake.php|website=Filmschoolrejects|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref> The film was supposed to be [[Back to back film production|filmed back-to-back]] with ''[[Cabin Fever: Patient Zero]]'', but these plans eventually fell through.<ref name="Cinemablendprod"/> and the idea of a remake was formed.<ref name="Cinemablendprod"/>

===Writing===
The film uses the same script as Roth's original, although director Travis Zariwny trimmed the page count from 134 to only 92.<ref name="EWproduction">{{cite web|last1=COLLIS|first1=Clark|title=Cabin Fever remake director promises gore aplenty|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/09/cabin-fever-remake|website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=12 February 2016}}</ref> Zariwhy also discussed and incorporated aspects that Roth wanted to include in the original but wasn't able to.<ref name="EWproduction"/> One change is that Deputy Winston, a male (portrayed by [[Giuseppe Andrews]]) in the first and [[Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever|second]] films, is now played by a female (portrayed by [[Louise Linton]]). Zariwny claimed he made this choice because "There was no way for me to emulate Giuseppe's performance."<ref name="EWproduction"/>

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Portland, Oregon]] in February 2015.<ref name="Cinemablendprod">{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Cabin-Fever-Getting-Remade-Under-Bizarre-Circumstances-67807.html|work=Cinema Blend|title=Cabin Fever Is Getting Remade Under These Bizarre Circumstances|author=Eisenberg, Eric|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Cabin Fever'' received a 0% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 28 reviews and has an average rating of 2.5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cabin_fever_2016/|title=Cabin Fever (2016)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a rating of 14 out of 100, based on 7 critics, indicating "overwhelming dislike".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cabin-fever-2016|title=Cabin Fever|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 14, 2016}}</ref>

Geoff Berkshire of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review writing: "It’s little surprise that Roth himself is the exec producer of this nearly beat-for-beat redo. Who else would feel as much passion for the middling material? And who better to ensure the copy does nothing to improve on the original? The silver lining of a day-and-date limited theatrical and VOD release is that there’s no chance this repurposed dud duplicates the original’s commercial performance."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/cabin-fever-review-remake-eli-roth-1201704334/|title=Film Review: ‘Cabin Fever’|work=Variety|first=Geoff|last=Berkshire|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}</ref> [[Glenn Kenny]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' also gave the film a negative review, writing: "Who benefits from the existence of this film? Certainly not the largely bland ensemble of post-adolescent actors cast as the leads, who here can scarcely be called characters." <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/movies/review-in-cabin-fever-the-flesh-eating-virus-strikes-again.html?partner=rss&emc=rss|title=Review: In ‘Cabin Fever,’ the Flesh-Eating Virus Strikes Again|publisher=nytimes.com|first=Glenn|last=Kenny|date=February 11, 2016|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}</ref>
