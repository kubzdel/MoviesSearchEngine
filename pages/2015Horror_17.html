The film stars Benjamin Rovner, Reid Warner and Darrin Bragg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18073|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|title=Details on Oren Peli's Top Secret 'Area 51' Uncovered!|date=November 11, 2009}}</ref> The film was released in a [[limited release]] and through [[video on demand]] on May 15, 2015 by [[Paramount Insurge]].

==Plot==
Reid, Darrin, and Ben are three close friends who are avid conspiracy theorists. Reid’s fascination with [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial activity]] is further enkindled when he inexplicably vanishes during the middle of a party and [[Alien_abduction#Return|has no memory]] of his disappearance. He spends the next three months devising a plan to infiltrate [[Area 51]] and uncover the base’s secrets. However, Reid's obsession with extraterrestrial research leaves him detached from his family and even causes him to lose his job. He is joined by Darrin, Ben, and Jelena, another conspiracy theorist whose father worked at Area 51. They plan on infiltrating the military base by using signal jammers, [[night vision goggles]], [[Freon]]-laced jumpsuits, and pills to mask their [[ammonia]] levels.<ref name="plot">{{cite news |last=Shotwell |first=James |url=http://underthegunreview.net/2015/05/19/movie-review-area-51-should-remain-off-limits/ |title=MOVIE REVIEW: ‘AREA 51’ SHOULD REMAIN OFF LIMITS |work=Under the Gun Review |date=2015-05-19 |accessdate=2017-05-18 }}</ref>

Per the advice of Jelena’s father, the group stalks a man they suspect is an important figure at Area 51. Reid and Darrin sneak into the man’s house and steal his security badge. Ben drops the three off in the middle of the desert and waits for them to return. Reid, Darrin and Jelena successfully bypass the base’s perimeter defenses and enter the complex using the security badge they had previously acquired. The three venture deeper into the base where they discover a lab containing a life-like liquid substance and anti-gravity material. They also encounter an alien spacecraft in a hangar, which only Reid can enter and interact with.
The three then reach the ‘S4’-level of Area 51, which contains the complex’s most secret information and experiments. They trigger an alarm and are swarmed by guards. Darrin is separated from the two and attempts to elude the guards and a predatory alien. He narrowly escapes the alien and retreats to the base’s higher levels.<ref name="plot"/>

Reid and Jelena venture deeper into the complex and discover a cave-like structure under Area 51. They find various articles of clothing, toys, and later pods of human blood and organs. The two then stumble upon a colony of sleeping aliens. One alien awakens and chases them out of the cave and into a different section of the complex. Reid and Jelena find themselves in a white chamber.  While Reid examines a series of alien symbols, Jelena is suddenly dragged away by an unseen force. He finds her in an entranced and unresponsive state. The chamber suddenly loses gravity and it is revealed that the chamber is in fact the interior of a flying silver alien spacecraft. Reid's camera falls from the spacecraft and plummets to the ground.

Darrin successfully escapes the complex and discovers all personnel are being evacuated from Area 51. He ventures back into the desert where he encounters Ben, who has been waiting for the three to return. Darrin frantically explains that their group was separated and urges Ben to drive away. However, their car’s engine promptly dies and the camcorder captures both men being abducted from the car.

In a post-credits scene, an old man, who was previously interviewed by the group, finds Reid's still-recording camcorder.
