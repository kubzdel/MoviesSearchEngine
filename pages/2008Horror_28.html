'''''Bone Eater''''' is a 2008 [[monster movie]] directed and written by [[Jim Wynorski]].  It stars [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as a sheriff who must stop a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] monster from destroying his town.  It premiered on [[Syfy]] and was later released on DVD.

== Plot ==
An unscrupulous land developer, Big Jim Burns, ignores the protests of Native Americans as he violates their ancestral burial grounds.  The local sheriff, Steve Evans, is caught in the middle of the conflict, as he is half Native American and half Caucasian.  When one of Burns' construction crews unearths an ancient relic, they unleash a giant skeletal monster that proceeds to kill everyone in its path.  Evans must deal with his rebellious daughter, unhelpful bureaucrats, and Johnny Black Hawk, a Native American who agitates for violence.  After consulting with the local chief, Storm Cloud, Evans learns he must locate the relic and use it in ritual combat against the monster.  Once Sheriff Evans acquires the relic, Johnny Black Hawk attempts to take it from him and use it to get vengeance on the town; Evans is forced to kill him in self-defense.  After donning war paint, Evans goes on to fight and ultimately defeat the Bone Eater.
