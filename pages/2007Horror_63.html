'''''Days of Darkness'''''  is a 2007 American [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Jake Kennedy]].  Survivors of a zombie apocalypse, including a young couple played by Travis Brorsen and Roshelle Pattison, seek shelter in an abandoned military complex while they attempt to figure out what has caused the outbreak.

== Plot ==
After a comet passes near the earth, most of the population becomes cannibalistic [[zombies]].  Survivors gather at a military complex, where they discover that an alien parasite borne of the comet infects the zombies.  The group includes Trent, a preacher, and his infected brother, Herbert; Simon, a gay man; Steve and Mimi, a young couple; Chad, a man who has been bitten on the arm; an ex-porn star and her daughter; a rancher; and several soldiers.  As the infection worsens, the parasite causes men's genitals to fall off and virgin births among the females.  After an unsuccessful attempt to forage for supplies that results in the deaths of several people, Steve attempts to save Mimi from the infection.  As he anesthetizes her with alcohol prior to operating on her, the alien organism flees from her body.  Realizing that alcohol can save them, they become drunk and use the rancher's whiskey supplies to destroy the zombies.

The location, a decommissioned NORAD microwave station in [[Topanga, California]], was purchased by a friend of the director.  Once they had the location, the filmmakers came up with a story; the producers desired a zombie film.<ref name=dendle>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000–2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=55–56|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>
