'''''Dead Air''''' is a 2009 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Corbin Bernsen]] and starring [[Bill Moseley]] and [[Patricia Tallman]]. The story focuses on a [[radio station]] that warns its listeners after an explosion unleashes [[zombies]] into [[Los Angeles]]. Screenwriter Kenny Yakkel explained before the film's release that the "undead" presented are not actual zombies: "It's like a PCP zombie movie, that's my take on it 'cause they're not really dead."<ref>{{cite web| work= Shock Til You Drop| title= Set Report: Dead Air| url= http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=58 | accessdate= 2007-07-18}}</ref>

==Plot==
A plague in the form of a toxic viral gas is unleashed at major sporting events across the United States.

Only blocks away from the explosion site, they begin to receive reports of rioters in the streets and listeners continue to call in reports of their first hand experiences. In addition to those infected by the virus, the terrorists, led by Abir, responsible for the attacks attempt to make their way to Logan's studio and kill anyone in the way.

==Reception==
Paul Mount of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated it 6/10 stars and called it "an enjoyably hokey experience" that overcomes its derivativeness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/2145-dvd-review-dead-air|title=DVD Review: Dead Air|last=Mount|first=Paul|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=2012-03-17|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>  Gareth Jones of [[Dread Central]] rated it 2/5 stars and wrote that the scenes "lack any kind of suspense or sense of threat".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/14509/dead-air-2009/|title=Dead Air (2009)|last=Jones|first=Gareth|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2009-11-23|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>  Dustin Hall of Brutal as Hell wrote the film "isn’t particularly scary" but "gives much to ponder".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brutalashell.com/2009/11/film-review-dead-air/|title=Film Review: Dead Air|last=Hall|first=Dustin|work=Brutal as Hell|date=2009-11-18|accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>  Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said that although the film is often compared to ''[[Pontypool (film)|Pontypool]]'', it stands on its own and has a different message: political and social versus the more philosophical and linguistic themes of ''Pontypool''.<ref name=dendle/>
