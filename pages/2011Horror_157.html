== Synopsis ==
The short opens with a couple playing with an antique jack-in-the-box in their kitchen. They appear to be mildly unnerved by the toy's clown and the wife laughingly leaves the room. Her husband follows shortly after and the two go to bed. Later that night the toy is shown winding itself up and the top opens, however no clown is seen. The husband wakes and hears a baseball rolling down the house's main stairway. He goes downstairs and finds the ball, then enters the kitchen where he sees the closed jack-in-the-box and starts winding it up. The camera then pans down to his feet and the viewer hears the sound of something hitting the man, followed by blood and gore hitting the floor. The wife wakes to the sound of clown laughter and makes her way downstairs. She watches horrified as the jack-in-the-box winds up and springs open, revealing her husband's severed head.
