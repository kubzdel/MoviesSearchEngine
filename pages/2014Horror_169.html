==Plot summary==
Skylar and Dan are happily celebrating their wedding when suddenly the Rapture occurs. Skylar's Christian parents are raptured, leaving their daughter and her new husband behind. She and Dan must find shelter from the new, extreme weather as well as from several winged demons that are keen on making Skylar and Dan their prey. They manage to take shelter in a nearby church along with several others remaining, where they re-examine their lives and personal faith in Jesus Christ, in the wake of remaining on Earth as it enters the seven years of Tribulation.
