'''''The Possessed''''' is a 2009 [[documentary film|documentary style]] [[horror film]] which was released to [[DVD]] in May 2009 and had its television debut in October that same year on [[SyFy]].<ref name="Iroquois County Times-Republic"/><ref name="Dread Central"/><ref name="Floyd County Times"/>

== Plot ==
The film is based upon the events surrounding what became known as the '[[Watseka Wonder]]'. Using period photographs, dramatic recreations, and interviews with subject experts, it addresses what is allegedly the first well-documented and recorded [[spirit possession]] story in America of 1877, and the subsequent recorded "possessions" suffered by Lurancy.

Beginning in 2006, and using the assistance of members of the Studio Nine class of [[List of high schools in Illinois#Iroquois County|Watseka Community High School]], ''The Possessed'' was shot on locations in [[Watseka, Illinois]], in the actual homes of, and including interviews of, the remaining family members of Lurancy Vennum.<ref name="Iroquois County Times-Republic"/>  The filmmakers included a repeat of an original 100-year-old séance, but were able to include modern measuring instruments. They also used footage of individuals themselves alleged to be possessed.<ref name="Dread Central2"/>

The film dramatically recreates the alleged events.  After years of violent and self-destructive behavior, a young Mary Roff from [[Watseka, Illinois]] was committed to an asylum in [[Peoria, Illinois]], and on July 5, 1865, she died. Twelve years later, a Watseka girl named Lurancy Vennum began exhibiting the same behavior as had Mary. When Asa Roff, a devout [[spiritist]], heard of the incident, and believing that the spirit of his deceased daughter Mary has possessed Lurancy, he convinced the Vennum family to not commit their own daughter.<ref name="Dread Central"/>  Lurancy Vennum moved in with the Asa Roff family in 1878 and lived with them for several days. There she was examined by a spiritist, Dr. E. W. Stevens, who wrote about the case, and upon whose journals the film was based.<ref name="Iroquois County Times-Republic2"/><ref name="Bruce1908">{{cite book|author=Henry Addington Bruce|title=Historic Ghosts and Ghost Hunters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tv8NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA174|year=1908|publisher=Moffat, Yard|pages=174–}}</ref>

== Reception ==
[[Dread Central]] wrote that the writers covered the entire story of Mary Roff and Lurancy Vellum within their documentary, with their having traveled to Illinois to interview topic experts, historians, and surviving family members. The reviewer wrote "I was fascinated by the documentary" but stated that the latter day claimants to being possessed did not seem believable.<ref name="Dread Central"/>
