'''''Shaun of the Dead''''' is a 2004 [[Comedy horror|comedy horror film]] directed by [[Edgar Wright]], written by Wright and [[Simon Pegg]], and starring Pegg and [[Nick Frost]]. Pegg plays Shaun, a directionless Londoner who is caught in an [[Zombie apocalypse|apocalyptic zombie uprising]]. The film was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for a [[BAFTA]]. It is the first in Wright and Pegg's ''[[Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy]], ''followed by 2007's ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' and 2013's ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7642129.stm|title=Interview with Simon Pegg  |accessdate=1 October 2008 |work=BBC Website  | date=1 October 2008}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!--Please keep plot summary between 400-700 words per WP:FILMPLOT-->
Shaun is an electronics salesman with no direction in his life. His colleagues disrespect him, he is estranged from his stepfather Philip, and his girlfriend Liz breaks up with him, unhappy spending every date at his local pub, the Winchester. He drowns his sorrows with his housemate and best friend Ed at the Winchester. At home, their housemate Pete, complaining of a bite wound from a drunk, berates Shaun to get his life together.

By morning, a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie apocalypse]] has overwhelmed London, but the hungover Shaun is slow to notice. He and Ed encounter two zombies in their garden and kill them with blows to the head. They form a plan to rescue Shaun's mother, Barbara, and Liz, then wait out the crisis in the Winchester. They escape in Pete's car, and pick up Barbara and Philip, who has been bitten, then Liz and her friends Dianne and David. Philip makes peace with Shaun, dies from his bites, and reanimates as a zombie.

The group abandon the vehicle and continue on foot. The streets surrounding the Winchester are overrun, so the group pretend to be zombies to sneak past them. Ed answers his phone, attracting the zombies' attention; while Shaun leads them away, the rest take refuge inside the Winchester, where Shaun rejoins them.

Shaun discovers the [[Winchester rifle]] above the bar is functional and the group attempts to use it to defend themselves. Barbara reveals she has been bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun her blessing. Shaun, distraught, is forced to shoot her after she reanimates. In the ensuing commotion, David is disembowelled by the zombies and Dianne rushes out to rescue him - disappearing into the advancing horde. Pete, zombified, bites Ed, but Shaun shoots Pete and sets fire to the bar. The fire spreads, setting off the rifle ammunition while Shaun, Liz and Ed flee into the cellar and contemplate suicide. Discovering a barrel hatch elevator that opens to the outside, Shaun and Liz escape as the wounded Ed volunteers to stay behind with the rifle. The British Army arrives and guns down the remaining zombies.

Six months after the outbreak, civilisation has returned to normal, with zombies used as cheap labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, and Shaun keeps the zombified Ed tethered in the garden shed so they can play video games together.

==Production==
The film is notable for Wright's kinetic directing style, and its references to other movies, television series and video games. In this way, it is similar to the British [[sitcom]] ''[[Spaced]]'', which both Pegg and Wright worked on in similar roles.

The film was inspired by the ''Spaced'' episode "[[List of Spaced episodes|Art]]", written by Pegg (along with his writing partner and co-star [[Jessica Hynes|Jessica Stevenson]]) and directed by Wright, in which the character of Tim (Pegg), under the influence of [[amphetamine]] and the [[video game]] ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', hallucinates that he is fighting off a zombie invasion. Having discovered a mutual appreciation for Romero's ''Dead'' trilogy, they decided to write their own zombie movie. ''Spaced'' was to be a big influence on the making of ''Shaun'', as it was directed by Wright in a similar style, and featured many of the same cast and crew in minor and major roles. Nick Frost, who played Mike in ''Spaced'', has a starring role in ''Shaun'' as Ed. Peter Serafinowicz and Julia Deakin{{spaced ndash}}who played Duane Benzie and Marsha in ''Spaced''{{spaced ndash}}appear in ''Shaun'' as Pete and Yvonne's mum, and Pegg's ''Spaced ''co-star Jessica Stevenson plays Yvonne.

The film's cast features a number of British comedians, comic actors, and sitcom stars, most prominently from ''Spaced'', ''[[Black Books]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. ''Shaun'' also co-stars [[Dylan Moran]], who played Bernard Black in ''Black Books'', Martin Freeman ([[Tim Canterbury]] in ''The Office''), [[Tamsin Greig]] (Fran in ''Black Books'', [[Caroline Todd (Green Wing character)|Caroline]] in ''[[Green Wing]]''), [[Julia Deakin]] (Marsha in ''Spaced''), [[Reece Shearsmith]] (Dexter in ''Spaced'' and a member of ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'') and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] (writer/co-star of ''[[Little Britain]]''). In addition, the voices of [[Mark Gatiss]] (''The League of Gentlemen'') and [[Julia Davis]] (''[[Nighty Night]]'') can be heard as radio news presenters, as can [[David Walliams]] (''[[Little Britain]]'') who provides the voice of an unseen TV reporter. [[Trisha Goddard]] also makes a cameo appearance, hosting two fictionalised episodes of her real-life talk show ''[[Trisha Goddard (TV series)|Trisha]]''. Many other comics and comic actors appear in cameos as zombies, including [[Rob Brydon]], [[Paul Putner]], [[Russell Howard]], Pamela Kempthorne (Morticia de'Ath in ''[[The Vampires of Bloody Island]]''), [[Joe Cornish (filmmaker)|Joe Cornish]], [[Antonia Campbell-Hughes]] (from the [[Jack Dee]] sitcom ''[[Lead Balloon]]''), [[Mark Donovan]] (''[[Black Books]]'') and [[Michael Smiley]] (Tyres in ''Spaced''). [[Coldplay]] members [[Chris Martin]] (who contributed to the soundtrack by guest singing the cover of [[Buzzcocks]]' "Everybody's Happy Nowadays" with [[Ash (band)|Ash]]) and [[Jonny Buckland]] also have cameo roles in the film.<ref>{{cite web|author=Slender Fungus |url=http://www.coldplay.com/oracledetail.php?id=331&page= |title=Coldplay Official Site: The Oracle Knows Everything |publisher=Coldplay.com |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref>

===Locations===
The production was filmed entirely in [[London]], on location and at [[Ealing Studios]], and involved production companies [[Working Title Films]] and [[StudioCanal]]. Many exterior shots were filmed in and around the North London areas of [[Crouch End]], [[Muswell Hill]], [[Finsbury Park, London|Finsbury Park]] and [[East Finchley]]. Zombie extras were mainly local residents or fans of ''Spaced'' who responded to a casting call organised through a fan website.

Shaun's place of work is an actual electrical appliances shop located at Tally Ho, North Finchley.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}

The scenes filmed in and around the "Winchester Tavern" pub were shot at the "Duke of Albany" pub, 39 Monson Road, [[New Cross]], South London â€“ a three-story [[Victorian era|Victorian]] pub.

==Comic strip==
Pegg and Wright also scripted a one-off tie-in comic strip for the British comic magazine ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]'' titled "[[Shaun of the Dead (comic)#2000 AD|There's Something About Mary]]".<ref>Shaun of the Dead: "There's Something About Mary" (by Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Frazer Irving, in 2000 AD #1384, 2004</ref>

Set the day before the zombie outbreak, the strip follows and expands on the character of Mary, who appears briefly in the introductory credits, and is the first zombie whom Shaun and Ed are aware of, and details how she became a zombie. It features expanded appearances from many of the minor or background characters who appear in the film. The strip was made available on the [[DVD]] release of ''Shaun'', along with two other strips that wrapped up "Plot Holes" in the film, like how Dianne escaped and survived the Winchester incident, and Ed's fate after taking refuge in the pub's basement.
