==Plot==
'K' ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) is a wealthy businessman in his 30s, and a heavy chain-smoker. He is confident, narcissistic and very arrogant in nature. After smoking cigarettes spiked with a potent form of [[marijuana]], he ends up in hospital. His family and friends beg him to quit smoking, to no avail. K's friend Abbas ([[Ranvir Shorey]]) and his doctor ([[Kiku Sharda]]), offer to set up an appointment at a rehabilitation centre called 'Prayogshaala' ('The Laboratory'), which they claim will surely rid K of his habit. K finally relents after his wife Anjali ([[Ayesha Takia]]) leaves him, unable to take the strain K's smoking addiction places on their relationship.

K decides to check out Prayogshaala, and meets Shri Shri Prakash Guru Ghantal Baba Bengali Sealdahwale ([[Paresh Rawal]]). The centre operates behind the front of another business, 'Kalkatta Karpets'. K finds the building to be unconventional and confusing, similar to a [[Labyrinth]]. The method Prayogshaala uses to cure their patients of their addiction is based on fear and psychological manipulation. Each time a patient gives in to their vice, Baba makes sure that something shocking happens to them.

The first offense is almost killing a loved one, by keeping him/her in a chamber full of cigarette smoke the person has smoked in his entire life, for a duration of 5 minutes.
The second offense is losing a finger.
The third offense is the death of a loved one.
The last offense is taking the soul of the person from his body, although this offense is described very loosely.

K initially refuses to sign the contract and pay the fee of {{INR}} 21,11,111 for his treatment but is forced to do so by Baba and his disciples. Baba then tells K that he is free to leave, but he must abide by the rules or he will suffer the consequences. K witnesses other members of the group as they try to quit smoking. Many end up losing fingers as they cannot resisit the urge to smoke.
K tries to keep to the terms but fails twice and is punished. He is now very conscious about the third time.

After some time, K meets an old friend, who is now a Cuban cigar seller. At an event, K is forced to place a cigar in his mouth, in order to appease his friend. Seconds later, he receives a phone call from the police, who inform him that his wife is missing and possibly dead. He calls Baba and is told that for smoking, his wife will be killed, as per the rules. He protests that he did not actually smoke and Baba apologizes for the mistake, but says it is too late. K asks Baba to tell the police about this, but the line goes dead and the phone number is non-existent on dialling. K's protests are ignored and the police believe that he is delusional. Trying to prove his story, he seeks out a friend who had lost a finger at the rehabilitation centre, only to find that the man has all fingers intact. Mocking him, the police force K to smoke. Shortly afterwards, K gets a phone call that his brother committed suicide due to his smoking habit. K raves angrily at the police and is thrown in Jail.

K is eventually bailed out. Soon, he learns that Baba permits sins and vices to be done during a period known as 'Zero Minute'. He attends an event, where he sees Baba, but is unable to reach him. K decides to light a cigarette. Suddenly, K wakes up in a Russian army base, with a call from his wife. She asks him why he believes she is dead. K is confused, but escapes from the base by jumping into water and ends up in a ragged room, from which he sees himself staring out from a hospital room. He also sees his wife and Baba. He calls out but no one can hear him, and he is told that it is because his body no longer hears his inner soul. The final punishment is complete.

In a series of haphazard events, the twisted path of K's soul is shown, until it finally reaches his body once again. K wakes up in his home to find his wife sleeping near him. He also discovers that he is missing two fingers. Later, K is seen recommending the "Prayogshala" centre to a friend.

==Production==

===Development===
The idea for the film came during the making of ''[[Satya (1998 film)|Satya]]'' (1998), when director [[Ram Gopal Varma]] pitched a story about a chain smoker's encounter with someone who despises smoking. Varma later incorporated his own idea of the story as a short segment in his anthology film, ''[[Darna Mana Hai]]'' (2003). During the shooting of Kashyap's ''[[Black Friday (2007 film)|Black Friday]]'', his assistant narrated him a different script about a chain smoker who wakes up without cigarettes and is unable to get any because of a curfew.<ref name=ns10/> Kashyap decided to take the story forward, taking inspiration from ''Quitters, inc'' and a surreal moment from ''Cats Eye'', subsequently making him develop the story into a darker and more unreal version.

===Casting===
After the scripting was complete in 2006, Kashyap narrated the film to [[Shahrukh Khan]], who was keen to do the film but later would back out for unknown reasons. When the deal fell through Kashyap who was in bad shape at the time, as one of his films were delayed and the other stuck in production, tried to get a hold of all the top actors, though none of them responded except for Abraham.<ref>{{cite web|title=No Smoking passes from Shahrukh to John|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/gupshup/2007/no-smoking-shahrukh-john-abraham-041007.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=[[Taran Adarsh]]|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=4 October 2007}}</ref> [[Vishal Bhardwaj]], Kashyap's friend and producer of the fiim recommended [[Saif Ali Khan]], as he was part of the smoking segment in ''Darna Mana Hai'', though Kashyap had already finalised Abraham. Later false reports surfaced that Saif be appearing in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], on the request of co-producer Kumar Mangat, who worked together in ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006).<ref>{{cite web|title=Saif and Bipasha: No butts please|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-07-21/news-interviews/27990194_1_saif-ali-khan-bipasha-basu-saif-and-bipasha|publisher=''[[Times of India]]''|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=21 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Saif Ali Khan is not doing 'No Smoking'|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20070726-2.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=26 July 2007}}</ref>

Due to the film having a complex storyline, when Kashyap was auditioning Abraham he read him a badly written fake script title ''Lapata'' (Lost), which Abraham declined to. After which he read him the real script of ''No Smoking'', he immediately agreed to do it.<ref>{{cite web|title='No Smoking will create a genre|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/23slid4.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref> Initially Takia was not comfortable with the love making scenes and the clothes of the secretary (Annie), though Kashyap refused to make any changes.<ref>{{cite web|title='Our cinema is immature'|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/24anurag.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=24 October 2007}}</ref> There is also a scene where Abraham is seen nude from rear, this stirred up some controversy.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Abraham to do a nude scene for No Smoking|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1179640/John-Abraham-to-do-a-nude-scene-for-No-Smoking|publisher=''[[Bollywood Hungama]]''|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=19 October 2006}}</ref> Abraham who had previously quit smoking, smoked up to 90 cigarettes a day during the shooting to give the film a more believable look. Later when the film was complete Abraham went for an X-ray and found his lungs were heavily damaged.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smoking turns John Abraham's lungs black|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/bollywood/features/2007/john-lungs-turns-black-191007.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=Upala KBR|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=19 October 2007}}</ref>

Originally director [[Rajkumar Santoshi]] was set to make his acting debut by playing the role of the doctor, and writer [[Abbas Tyrewala]] was to play the role later given to Shorey, hence Kashyap named the character after the writer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rajkumar Santoshi to act in No Smoking|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/1174279|publisher=''[[India Fm]]''|author=|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>

===Filming===
Most of the filming was done in unique ways. In one scene where Abraham and Shorey are seen as teenagers smoking [[Marijuana]], most directors would have used child actors but Kashyap decided instead to alter the appearance of the actors and make them improvise and behave as kids themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title='No Smoking' defies convention|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20071025-4.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|author=Nikhil Kumar|accessdate=16 August 2012|date=23 September 2007}}</ref>

The film was shot extensively in parts of the [[Russian Federation]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Siberia]], in extremely cold climates with temperatures of minus 25 [[Celsius|degrees Celsius]] (°C), despite this none of the crew members had any problems during the shooting.<ref>{{cite web|title=No Smoking to be shot in Russia|url=http://businessofcinema.com/bollywood-news/ino-smokingi-to-be-shot-in-russia/|publisher=''Businessofcinema''|author=Johnny Vaz|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=12 January 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=John Abraham shoots in chilly climate|url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20070122-2.html|publisher=Apunkachoice|accessdate=14 August 2012|date=22 January 2007}}</ref> During the shooting in Uzbekistan, a Russian actor dressed as a soldier had to chase Abraham. After running 200 meters the man collapsed, as the shooting was on high altitudes, there was a lack of oxygen. He had to be rushed to the hospital, as he had stopped breathing.<ref>{{cite web|title='I am doing films that are more meaningful'|url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2007/oct/23slid4.htm|publisher=''[[Rediff.com]]''|author=Patcy N|date=23 October 2007|accessdate=24 August 2012}}</ref>

===Critical reception===

====India====
The film was heavily panned by Indian critics. ''[[Sify]]'' gave it 2 out of 5 stars saying "You try so hard to understand what ''No Smoking'' tries to say, but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved. John makes a sincere attempt to leave a mark and succeeds to an extent.

 |quote  = “I was extremely angry and bitter after ''No Smoking''. People reviewed me rather than the movie. It was a new kind of film and while it was getting international recognition, in my own country it was being ripped apart. I learnt a lesson though and it was that if you have to do something new, you have to go step by step. First and foremost, look at how the film would recover money. ''No Smoking'' was an expensive film and it hurts"

===Reception===
The soundtrack album received critical acclaim. Abhishek Singh from ''Planet Bollywood'' said "Over all, as expected, the music turns out to be daringly different and in complete contrast to anything that you might have ever listened. Almost all the songs carry the message of the film along and for that reason only, one can’t be sure of this album on a stand alone basis but seen along side the concept of the movie, it sure hits the bulls eye".<ref>{{cite web|title=No Smoking music review|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/displayReview.php?id=101407073113|publisher=''Planet Bollywood''|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref> Joginder Tuteja from ''[[India Fm]]'' said "With music by Vishal Bhardwaj and lyrics by Gulzar saab, one expects an unconventional soundtrack in the offering. Well, unconventional it is and in at least a couple of places, exciting too! This has to be one of the most original tracks ever written. 'Jab Bhi Cigarette' is the opening song of the album and may well be termed as the title song of the album".<ref>{{cite web|title=No Smoking - Music Review|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/music/reviews/2007/no-smoking-music-review-021107.html|publisher=''[[Oneindia.in]]''|author=Joginder Tuteja|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=2 November 2007}}</ref> Satyajit from ''Glamsham'' said "''No Smoking'' dares to be different for chartering unexplored territories and have surprises in raucously driven vivacious tracks like “Phoonk De” and “Jab Bhi Cigarette”. [[Rekha Bhardwaj]]’s peculiar nasal twang will be garnering major spotlight in “Phoonk De (club mix) with chartbusting success after her subtle and submissive ''[[Laaga Chunari Mein Daag]]''".<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Review : No Smoking|url=http://www.glamsham.com/music/reviews/13_music_review_no_smoking_100701.asp|publisher=''Glamsham''|author=Satyajit|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref>

==Possible Sequel==
Despite the film being critically and commercially unsuccessful, in 2018 Kashyap discussed the possibility of a sequel, with Bhavin Acharya playing the lead character and the story carrying on from where ''No Smoking'' left off.  He asked fans on [[Twitter]] for ideas and what they would like to see.<ref>{{cite web|title=No Smoking sequel on Kashyap's mind|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/No-Smoking-sequel-on-Kashyap-s-mind/Article1-751206.aspx|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|author=|date=28 September 2011|accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|title=John Abraham plans No Smoking sequel|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/John-Abraham-plans-No-Smoking-sequel/Article1-759096.aspx|publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]''|author=|date=19 October 2011|accessdate=11 February 2012}}</ref>
