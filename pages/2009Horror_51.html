'''''Daybreakers''''' is a 2009 Australian-American [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[The Spierig Brothers|Michael and Peter Spierig]]. The film takes place in a futuristic world overrun by [[vampire]]s. A vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm the remaining humans while researching a blood substitute. Lead vampire hematologist Edward Dalton's ([[Ethan Hawke]]) work is interrupted by human survivors led by former vampire "Elvis" ([[Willem Dafoe]]), who has a cure that can save the human species.

''Daybreakers'' premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2010 and in North America on 8 January 2010. The film grossed over US$50&nbsp;million and received mixed to positive critical reception.

==Plot==
In 2019, a plague has transformed most of the world's population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into "subsiders," psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic [[Blood substitutes|blood substitute]].

Edward Dalton ([[Ethan Hawke]]) is the head [[Hematology|hematologist]] for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley ([[Sam Neill]]). Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso ([[Vince Colosimo]]) are developing a blood substitute. 

Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey ([[Claudia Karvan]]), learns Edward's name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.

At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie ([[Michael Dorman]]). Frankie's gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edward's sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edward's house, forcing the brothers to kill it.

The next morning, Audrey visits Edward's home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel "Elvis" Cormac ([[Willem Dafoe]]), a human who was once a vampire.  Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey.  Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash.  Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.

That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner ([[Jay Laga'aia]]), a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audrey's group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers  track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.

One of the captured convoy, Alison ([[Isabel Lucas]]), is revealed to be Charles' human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alison's death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes [[martial law]] to control the subsider population and preserve order.

Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christopher's home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.

Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute.  Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.

Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders.  Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankie's blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only (what at first appears to be three) six soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered.  Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the six and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.

The three survivors drive off into the sunrise.  In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure.

== Cast ==
{{castlist|
*[[Ethan Hawke]] as Edward Dalton. He is a 35-year-old vampire hematologist who was turned by his brother Frankie, and started working for the newly formed Bromley Marks to work on a blood substitute. He shows sympathy for the humans, since he refused to be turned at the start of the plague, and refuses to drink human blood, instead relying on animal blood. He volunteers for the project to be turned back into a human and leads a revolution to return the human race back.
*[[Willem Dafoe]] as Lionel "Elvis" Cormac. A former professional mechanic, he was one of the first in the city to adapt cars for daylight driving, with retractable [[Ultraviolet|UV]] screens and exterior cameras. One time, while driving during the daytime, he was exhausted from not drinking blood, which caused him to be distracted, and crash his black [[Chevrolet Bel Air|1957 Chevy Bel Air]] into a fence, ejecting him into the sunshine; Elvis was set in flames, but his life was saved when he fell into the water, turning him back human due to the precise exposure to the sun. He was found by Audrey.
*[[Sam Neill]] as Charles Bromley, ruthless owner of Bromley Marks, the largest provider of blood in the U.S.  In 2008, shortly before the plague, he was diagnosed with cancer and expected to live only a few years.  He became a vampire to save himself from cancer, at the cost of being rejected by his beloved daughter Alison.  He has no interest becoming human again, since he wants to use the substitute to become the richest man alive and for all eternity.
*[[Claudia Karvan]] as Audrey Bennett, who was educating at college during the plague. She hid on her family's old vineyard, and refusing to become a vampire, she gathered humans and sheltered them. She also found the already cured Elvis and sheltered him. They lead the group to try to find other survivors.
*[[Michael Dorman]] as Frankie Dalton, Edward's estranged younger brother, who turned his brother into a vampire since he was afraid of losing him. Frankie has an epiphany after turning back into a human and wants to help, but is later killed while trying to help his brother.
*[[Isabel Lucas]] as Alison Bromley, Charles' estranged daughter, forcibly turned into a vampire by Frankie. She rejected her father and turned into a subsider after drinking her own blood. Her death caused Frankie to have an epiphany and change sides.
*[[Vince Colosimo]] as Christopher Caruso, a hematologist, Edward's coworker at Bromley Marks, although much less ambitious than Edward. He succeeds in creating a blood substitute, which would make him wealthy and powerful in a world of vampires, and so is hostile to the possibility of a cure for vampirism.
*[[Jay Laga'aia]] as Senator Wes Turner, another vampire who secretly harbors sympathies with humans and wants to help the human race.

[[Weta Workshop]] created the creature effects for ''Daybreakers''.<ref name="bites" /> The Spierig brothers wanted the vampires in the film to have a classical aesthetic to them while feeling like a more contemporary interpretation. After experimenting with complex makeup designs, they decided that a more minimalistic approach to makeup had a more powerful effect.<ref name="AICNfirstlook">{{cite news | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34516 | title=Quint has your first look at the Spierig Bros' new film, DAYBREAKERS, as well as a chat with the directors!!! | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]] | date=22 October 2007 | accessdate=15 March 2010 }}</ref>

Hawke was initially hesitant to join the production as he was "not a big fan" of genre films. He ultimately accepted the role as Edward after deciding the story felt "different" from that of a typical [[B movie]].<ref name="AICNfirstlook" /> Hawke described the film as an allegory of man's pacing with natural resources, "We're eating our own resources so people are trying to come up with blood substitutes, trying to get us off of foreign humans."<ref name="mtv">{{cite news | author=Shawn Adler | url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/07/02/ethan-hawke-gets-ready-to-suck-as-vampire-researcher/ | title=Ethan Hawke Gets Ready To Suck As Vampire Researcher | publisher=MTV | date=2 July 2007 | accessdate=3 July 2007 }}</ref> The actor also said that despite the serious allegory, the film was "low art" and "completely unpretentious and silly".<ref name="mtv"/>

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review stating the film had a "cold, steely blue, black and gray '[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'-y look" going on to say ''Daybreakers'' "emerges as a competent but routine chase thriller that lacks attention-getting dialogue, unique characters or memorable setpieces that might make it a genre keeper rather than a polished time-filler."<ref>{{cite web|first=Dennis |last=Harvey |url=https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/daybreakers-1200475774/ |title=Daybreakers |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' gave the film two and a half out of four stars and called the film a [[B movie]] and a "nifty genre piece".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/daybreakers-20100107|title=Daybreakers Review|date=7 January 2010|work=Rolling Stone|author=[[Peter Travers]]|accessdate=10 March 2011}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] also gave the film two and a half stars stating the "intriguing premise ... ends as so many movies do these days, with fierce fights and bloodshed."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/daybreakers-2010|title=Daybreakers |date=6 January 2010 |work=RogerEbert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|authorlink=Roger Ebert|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref>  [[Richard Roeper]] gave the film a B+ and called it "a bloody good time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/daybreakers.aspx|title=Daybreakers Review|authorlink=Richard Roeper|last=Roeper|first=Richard|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref>
