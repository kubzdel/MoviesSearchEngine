== Plot summary ==

Based on the [[Imperium Comics]] series of the same name, ''Trailer Park of Terror'' follows six troubled high school students and their leader, the optimistic youth ministries pastor, Lewis ([[Matthew Del Negro]]). As the group return from an outdoor character building retreat in the mountains they become lost on the back roads after their bus crashes during a raging storm. The luckless group seeks refuge for the night in a seemingly abandoned trailer park down the road, managed by the strange and seductive Norma ([[Nichole Hiltz]]).

Dai Green of Horrornews.net described the film as "a grotesque, bloody, hilarious, testament to what happens when a director knows there is more out there than horror-p*rn flicks,"  and likened the character of Norma to "a cross between Reese Witherspoon in ‘Freeway’ and Sherrie Moon Zombie in ‘House Of 1000 Corpses’."  He gave the film a rating of "four horns".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/18296/film-review-trailer-park-of-terror-2008/|title=Film Review: Trailer Park of Terror (2008) - HNN|author=|date=|website=horrornews.net|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}</ref> Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' thought the film was well cast and that some of the young actors were impressive in their efforts to flesh out their thin roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/reviews/trailer-park-of-terror-1200548071/|title=Review: ‘Trailer Park of Terror’|first=Joe|last=Leydon|date=February 13, 2008|website=variety.com|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}</ref>
