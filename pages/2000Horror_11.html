'''''Bless the Child''''' is a 2000 German-American [[Horror film|horror]]-[[thriller film]]<ref>{{AllMovie title|184484}}</ref> directed by [[Chuck Russell]] and starring [[Kim Basinger]], [[Jimmy Smits]], [[Angela Bettis]], [[Rufus Sewell]], [[Christina Ricci]], and [[Holliston Coleman]]. It is based on the novel of the same name by [[Cathy Cash Spellman]].

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=May 2017}}
Maggie O'Connor's ([[Kim Basinger]]) life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital. Her sister Jenna, a hardcore drug user ([[Angela Bettis]]), abandons her newborn daughter Cody at Maggie's home. Maggie takes Cody in, and she becomes the daughter she never had. Cody is diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and is enrolled in a Catholic school for children with special needs in order to make her more aware of her surroundings (part of her condition). The nuns who run the school are struggling to keep Cody out of danger and keep her occupied. Cody begins to show special telekinetic abilities, such as being able to spin toys. She also resurrects a bird after it flies into a school window and breaks its neck.

Meanwhile, children with the same birth date and age as Cody begin to be abducted and killed around the city. Members of a mysterious cult, with a black symbol tattooed on their arms, are shown to be tracking and abducting these children. They are apparently trying to find a child with certain unspecified abilities. If they do not exhibit such abilities, the cult murders and discards them.

One night, Maggie is at work at her local hospital where she meets a young woman called Cheri Post ([[ Christina Ricci]]) who was formerly part of the same cult. Cheri is a drug user who is afraid to show Maggie her arms which are covered in track marks and tattoos, one being the same satanic symbol of the cult. She recognizes Maggie's surname and comments on her similarity with Jenna. Maggie begs Cheri to tell her where Jenna is living, as neither she nor Cody has seen her since Jenna left. Rather than disclosing Jenna's location, Cheri warns Maggie to protect Cody as the cult is looking for her. Cheri is hospitalized after cult members attempt to murder her.

Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric ([[Rufus Sewell]]), and abducts Cody ([[Holliston Coleman]]). Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, [[FBI]] agent John Travis ([[Jimmy Smits]]), an expert in [[ritual murder]] and [[occult]]-related crime, takes up her case when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children.

Cody, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply special. She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.
