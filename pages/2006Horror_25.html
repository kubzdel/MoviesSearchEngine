== Plot ==

A [[septet]] of friends (Andy, Roger, Tricia, Max, Nell, Charlotte and Nicole) travel to a cluster of lakeside cabins, where they unearth a "blood book" that tells the story of Preacher Jacob, a priest who took over the nearby town's congregation in 1896. Jacob had his followers commit mass suicide under the belief that he could resurrect them as a new, perfect race enlightened by their deaths. Max and Nell go off to have sex, but before they do so Max skims the blood book and reads an incantation aloud, summoning the homicidal spirit of Preacher Jacob.

The first of the group to be killed is Roger, who Preacher Jacob axes in the back. The preacher then captures Nicole, ties her to a tree, and hacks her to death with the axe. Next, Sam is garroted with a rope, while Nell has her throat slit in the shower. Tricia realizes what is going on, and tries to get help from Andy and Charlotte, but the two are kept sealed in their cabin by a supernatural force, which relents after Tricia flees at the sight of Preacher Jacob. Andy and Charlotte decide to barricade themselves in the cabin until sunrise, and pass the time by having sex.

Later, Charlotte goes to wake Andy up, but finds Preacher Jacob in his bed. The undead holy man kills her, then goes after the wounded Andy (who has the blood book) and Tricia. Jacob chases Andy and Tricia to a dock, strangles Andy, and is seemingly destroyed when Tricia sets the blood book on fire. Tricia gets in one of the cars and drives away, but as she leaves the campgrounds, Preacher Jacob appears in the vehicle, and attacks her.

== Reception ==

Max Schwartz of ''[[AVN (magazine)|AVN]]'' gave ''Blood Lake'' a 3/5, calling the sex scenes passable, and noting that the film suffered from an incoherent script, sloppy editing, painful acting, and dull dialogue.<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.avn.com/movies/10993.html|title = ''Blood Lake''|last = Schwartz|first = Max|publisher = AVN|date = 1 January 2007|website = avn.com|accessdate = 19 September 2012}} </ref> X Critic, which awarded a .5 out of 5, labeled ''Blood Lake'' "one of the worst hardcore releases in recent years" and opined that it felt "half completed, over edited and devoid of anything that makes terror and [[twat]] the least bit interesting".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.xcritic.com/review/25064/blood-lake/|title = ''Blood Lake''|last = Dirge|first = Disco|publisher = X Critic|date = 14 November 2006|website = xcritic.com|accessdate = 5 August 2012}} </ref> The same score was given to the film by Adult DVD Talk, which condemned ''Blood Lake'' as a "tedious viewing experience" in which "the photography is terrible, the editing is laughably inept, and the acting is as non existent as the gore".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/review/blood-lake|title = ''Blood Lake''|last = comment|first = classix|publisher = Adult DVD Talk|date = 1 May 2008|website = adultdvdtalk.com|accessdate = 5 August 2012}} </ref>

[re]Search my Trash's Mike Haberfelner similarly condemned ''Blood Lake'', writing, "Basically, this is hardcore porn and [[Slasher film|slasher movie]] rolled into one - and at least on paper that seems a good idea as slasher movies often use sexual allusions anyways, so why not just make the sex explicit? Unfortunately, ''Blood Lake'' doesn't quite function that way, as the sex scenes don't seem to be properly integrated into the plot, are pretty much just self-serving, too run-of-the-mill and invariably break up the narrative tension rather than contribute to it (that said, the girls are hot at least). Plus, on a narrative level, the film is full of [[Non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]]s, and one fails to actually feel for the characters as they all lack depth or at least distinction. Now personally I'm all for narrative porn, but with this one one just wishes someone had tried to piece together an actual story than just throw genre mainstays at bland characters".<ref> {{cite web|url = http://www.searchmytrash.com/movies/bloodlake%282006%29.shtml|title = ''Blood Lake''|last = Haberfelner|first = Mike|publisher = [re]Search my Trash|date = |website = searchmytrash.com|accessdate = 16 October 2015}} </ref>
