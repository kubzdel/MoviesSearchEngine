It was directed by [[Gregg Bishop]] and produced by Gary Binkow, Jude S. Walko, [[Brad Miska]] and [[David Bruckner]]. One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for a wild night of club hopping and debauchery. But the party becomes a savage fight for survival when they unwittingly unleash a fabled predator upon the festivities.

==Plot==
One week before his wedding day, Jonah and his groomsmen hit the town for his stag party, hosted by his irresponsible brother Mac. Attempting to be more original, Mac takes them to Garden City instead of a typical party location hoping for a wild night, and instead they wind up at a lackluster strip club. Visibly disappointed at his efforts, Mac attracts the attentions of a stranger who tells him about an underground moving club that promises to surpass all expectations.  

A reluctant Jonah agrees to go, but the long drive to 50n/40w through a dark forest unnerves the group, as does the club when they finally arrive. The patrons and dancers almost convince the group to leave until the club owner, Mr. Nyx, comes out to personally welcome and see to their entertainment. Upon hearing that Jonah wants a non-cheating experience, Nyx takes him into another room and tells him to go to the window at the end while his groomsmen pay. He asks from each of the 3 men their favorite memories of their mothers. At the window, Jonah sees a nude young woman on the other side of the glass who begins singing. Jonah suddenly relives all the sexual encounters he's ever had at once. Meanwhile, at the main bar, one of the groomsmen, Elliot, has a custom drink with a leech in it and suddenly experiences the memory of murdering someone, after which both Mac and Rand realize they all have matching marks on the back of their necks. 

After leaving the window, Jonah hears the girl ask him not to leave and sees that the door to the room is padlocked from the outside. Fearing that the girl is a sex slave, Jonah gets Rand, tells the others to get to the car, and the two break the lock and let her out. While attempting to sneak out of the club, the 3 get waylaid by guards and hide in a bathroom. Once there, the girl uses Jonah's swiss army knife to open a shackle around her ankle, and then brutally kills the guard that followed them, revealing claws and a long tail. Jonah and Rand run for the car and the 4 drive away, only for the girl to suddenly land on the roof and cause them to crash.  

While the girl grabs Elliot and drags him off, Nyx and his posse arrive and kidnap Rand as Jonah and Mac escape. Back at the club, Nyx questions Rand, asking why they released "the Lilith", before allowing the brother of the murdered guard to torture him. Out in the woods, Jonah and Mac desperately try to find Elliot while arguing over who's to blame for the way the night has gone. Jonah realizes that the girl had sniffed him after being released, and had gone after Elliot because he has been wearing his jacket. The 2 attempt to cover their scent, managing to escape and find their way to a diner patroned by a pair of cops. They desperately try to describe the past few hours and the cops cuff them, Mac noticing in alarm that they have the same mark on the backs of their necks, realizing that they work for Nyx. The girl arrives at the diner and starts to sing, entrancing the cop with Jonah who quickly puts in his headphones and turns on his ipod to drown her out, watching as she murders both cops. Chasing him through the diner, the girl reveals a demonic face, announcing "I like you" before grabbing Jonah and flying away. 

Back at the club, Nyx orders one of his minions, who appears to be some sort of [[Gorgon]], to take a very injured Rand's memories of being tortured, hunt down Jonah, and give them to him. The minion does this by taking a medusa-like leech from her head and inserting into then removing it from the mark on the back of his neck, revealing what had happened earlier when paying for Jonah's session and what had happened with Elliot, implying that part of Nyx's business is selling people memories.

Back with Jonah, he and the girl land in a quarry, and after a few attempts to escape, she rapes him while singing, again creating a fantasy of him having sex with his fiance, Eva. When he comes back to himself, Jonah runs from the now sleeping girl and makes it back to his hotel room where the minion is waiting for him. She forces him to eat the leech and Jonah relives Rand's torture and the memory of Nyx speaking directly to him and offering a trade; the girl for Rand. All he has to do is go to a church and the girl will follow him. Jonah agrees and follows the minion to the church. 

Once there, a few things become clearer. The girl, Lily, is actually a demon from hell (a [[succubus]] to be exact) that was summoned years ago, imprisoned by Nyx, and forced to become a sex slave. Lily had become infatuated with Jonah because he was kind and helped her escape. Succubi mate for life and Lily wants him to stay with her, killing anyone who gets in her way. The church is the location where she was originally summoned and Nyx needs Jonah to lure her into a rune circle and reattach the shackle around her ankle, as he is the only person she won't kill.  

Lily arrives and hesitantly steps into the circle. Jonah tells Lily he made a mistake when he released her, not knowing what she was. To Nyx's anger, Jonah makes a new deal with Lily; he won't put the shackle on if she will let Jonah go. Lily agrees, and proceeds to slaughter Nyx and his henchmen, while Jonah grabs a seriously injured Rand. Mac arrives and sacrifices himself saving his brother from a vengeful Nyx. Lily kisses Jonah goodbye, and watches while Jonah and Rand leave.  

A year later, Jonah and Eva are married. They make love on their anniversary. Jonah goes to get a glass of water afterwards and sees Eva asleep on the couch, realizing that he had made love to Lily and not Eva. Jonah attempts to get Lily to leave and almost succeeds, until Eva notices Lily and starts to scream, whereupon Lily starts to attack her. Jonah begs her to stop and says he will go with her. Lily grabs Jonah and they fly off into the night, Eva hysterically screaming after them.

==Production==

Executive producer [[David Bruckner]] developed the screenplay with writers Luke Piotrowski and Ben Collins and was heavily involved in the making of the film. The film's budget was $300,000 and was shot in 18 days in Savannah, GA and edited in 4 weeks without time for any pick-ups or reshoots. [[David Bruckner]] directed the second unit for the movie upon the request of director [[Gregg Bishop]]. 

Even though the studio was pushing for other actresses for the role of Lily, director [[Gregg Bishop]] insisted that [[Hannah Fierman]] reprise her role from [[V/H/S]]. [[Justin Welborn]] was cast as Mr. Nyx, who also starred in [[David Bruckner]]'s film [[The Signal (2007 film)|The Signal]] and [[Gregg Bishop]]'s film [[Dance of the Dead (film)|Dance of the Dead]].

After the delivery date was moved up, the director didn't have any input on several final visual FX shots because the post house had to cut them in and deliver the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4667854/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv|title=SiREN (2016) trivia|work=[[imdb]]}}</ref>
