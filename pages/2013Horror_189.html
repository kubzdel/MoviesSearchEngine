==Premise==
On [[Christmas Eve]], office maintenance worker W. C. (Dan Palmer) avoids an office party to clean the toilets. He soon sees two women arrive and make out but one of them is revealed to be a zombie and bites the other woman, infecting her as well. More zombies arrive and W.C. becomes trapped in the stall. A coworker of W.C. arrives and attempts to save him but is bitten on the neck and dies. In order to save W.C. fellow survivor Heather (Antonia Bernath), who was in the stall next to W.C., sacrifices herself by opening the doors and letting the zombies eat her. W.C. then goes to a phone booth and calls his mother, apologizing for everything he has done and tells her to lock her windows and doors and to not go outside. He promises her he will be home for Christmas, but he soon discovers the phone booth is surrounded by zombies and the credits roll, leaving W. C.'s fate unknown.
