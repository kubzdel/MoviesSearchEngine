==Reception==
''Abattoir'' has received negative reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 32% rating with 19 reviews counted.<ref>{{Rotten Tomatoes|abattoir|Abattoir}}</ref> [[Metacritic]] gave the film a 40 which illustrates "mixed or average".<ref>{{cite web|title=Abattoir|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/abattoir|website=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

Brian Tallerico writing for [[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.com]] gave the film a half star calling it "one of the most baffling and ineffective horror films of the year."<ref>{{cite web|last=Tallerico|first=Brian|title=Abattoir|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/abattoir-2016|website=[[Roger Ebert|RogerEbert.Com]]|date=December 9, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> Dennis Harvey, writing for [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], found the film lacking in focus saying "In the end, ''Abattoir'' feels like a confused rehash of ideas from the variable likes of ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'', ''[[Thirteen Ghosts]]'' and other haunted-house movies, albeit one so misjudged that it doesn’t even get to the house itself until the last 20 minutes or so. If there were potential here, it’s been garbled in translation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Film Review: ‘Abattoir’|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/abattoir-film-review-1201931566/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 5, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

On the other hand, John DeFore, for [[The Hollywood Reporter]], called it "A pulpy supernatural tale dripping with atmosphere."<ref>{{cite web|last=DeFore|first=John|title='Abattoir': Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/abattoir-954083|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> John Squires writing for [[Bloody Disgusting]] called the film "one of the most original horror movies to come out in the last several years."<ref>{{cite web|last=Squires|first=John|title=Darren Bousman’s ‘Abattoir’ is the Best 2016 Horror Movie You Didn’t See|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3421306/darren-bousmans-abattoir-best-2016-horror-movie-didnt-see/|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=January 16, 2017|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>

==Comic book prequel==
In 2010, Darren Bousman developed a comicbook prequel to the film from [[Radical Studios]]. The six-issue miniseries was written by Rob Levin and Troy Peteri, with art by Bing Cansino. Bousman outlined his plans with, "I want to create a universe, and this is the beginning of a universe. I don’t foresee using the comic book to be what the movie is. But it’s part of the world of what the movie will exist in, and everything will stand on its own. For example, the comic book will be its own world, its own movie, its own book, its own story. The movie will be its own world, its own story, but they will all connect. All pieces of this thing connect and tell a much bigger tale...  think it’s important to lead into the movie. We came up with this as a script, as a feature film idea, but what we wanted to accomplish in the feature film was way, way, way too ambitious for a 90-minute movie. So we had to backtrack and set the world up that way." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destroythebrain.com/movies/movie-news/darren-lynn-bousman-unveils-new-horror-comic-abattoir|title=Darren Lynn Bousman Unveils New Horror Comic: ABATTOIR}}</ref>

==Sequel==
A sequel to ''Abattoir'' titled ''The Dwelling'' was announced in May 2016, with Bousman set to write and direct and Callie to reprise his role as Jebediah Crone.<ref name="Variety"/>
