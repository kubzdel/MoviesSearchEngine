==Plot==
The movie starts with a young girl running through a dark wood from a shadowy figure. The scene becomes bleak as a severed hand is seen next to the girls dead body and the body is dragged away. On the hand is a silver ring.
Jordan (Alix Elizabeth Gitter) is a teenager that has been orphaned after her father dies of Leukemia.  Her mother died from drowning when Jordan was five years old. She's sent to live with an aunt (Tara Westwood), who is the identical twin of her mother, and uncle ([[Steve Bacic]]). They live in the town of Silver Falls, where she learns of ghost stories being told after seeing a burning mannequin at a park where teens go to party. When police come to raid the party Jordan wanders the surrounding forest and discovers the ring, which she places on her forefinger without even thinking.
When she returns home she tries to remove the ring, but it won't come off. The ring, it turns out, attracts the ghost of the girl who had mysteriously been murdered twenty years before. No one, however, knows of the murder. 
The ghost does mischievous acts around the house, such as moving pictures, opening doors, and stealing small items from Jordan's aunt and uncle. These actions cause concern in her household causing them to make an appointment with the local psychologist, who is not fond of Jordan, as he believes she is a negative influence on his geek son.

== Reception ==

''[[NOW Toronto]]'' gave a mostly negative review for ''A Haunting at Silver Falls'', writing that it "isnâ€™t wildly scary, but its slightly unusual take on the ghost story gives it a memorable creepiness."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dowler|first=Andrew|title=A Haunting At Silver Falls (review)|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=192786|publisher=NOW Toronto|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref> ''[[DVD Verdict]]'' and ''[[JoBlo.com]]'' both gave mixed reviews, as both felt that while it wasn't a particularly good film it did have some merits and would appeal to some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Alice|title=A Haunting at Silver Falls (review)|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/hauntingsilverfalls.php|publisher=DVD Verdict|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A HAUNTING AT SILVER FALLS (review)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/a-haunting-at-silver-falls|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=15 March 2014}}</ref>
