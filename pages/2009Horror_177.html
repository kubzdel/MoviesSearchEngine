== Reception ==
Mike Everleth of the ''Underground Film Journal'' (then ''Bad Lit'') called the film "a fairy tale for adults, in every sense [with] some blue language", but also commended the visual style as "beautifully unique" and the story as a "[masterfully rich woven] tapestry for a far-out fable". He wrote that "''The Romantic'' is a very rich and complex fairy tale and, like all good fairy tales, has deep moral metaphors buried within its story." Everleth especially lauded the characterization, both visually and in their objectives, writing they are "unable to escape their fates, in the way that many of us can feel pushed and pulled around by our own emotions."<ref>Mike Everleth. "[http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/feature-film-online-the-romantic/ Feature Film Online: The Romantic]", ''Underground Film Journal'', 20 February 2011. Retrieved 10 March 2013.</ref>

Mark Bell of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film four out of five stars, writing that "the story is a little bit all over the place" and that "allegories about religion and philosophy play out simultaneously." Visually he called it "a style all its own, and it is all-out crazy", and compared it to ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' ("though not as psychedelic") and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] ("though not as abstract").<ref>Mark Bell. "[http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/26803/ The Romantic]", ''[[Film Threat]]'', 16 October 2010. Retrieved 10 March 2013.</ref>

Matt Cantor of ''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]'' called the film "an eerie, haunting film that's part myth, part fairy tale, and part fable." He wrote that the plot was "more episodic" than a traditional Hollywood story arc and "at times difficult to follow", but called the Tim Burton-echoing animation ultra-smooth, gorgeous and original. He also commended Jason Salerno's performance as Romance "passionate and convincing" and Nathan Terry's original film score "sweet and atmospheric".<ref>Matt Cantor.

Director Michael P. Heneghan said that "Submitting to film festivals was far, far more expensive than making the film", but "Surprisingly, a pop-fantasy animated feature film festooned with cartoon ding-dongs and nudey parts featuring a cast of difficult-to-love monsters working out their baggage over the course of a million subversive plot points didnâ€™t really strike a chord with most film festival curators. Our first rejection letter came from a festival that I really wanted to be a part of and thus we started our film festival application process with a small chip on the shoulder and a little bit of a wounded heart. So it goes."<ref name="geekadelphia-2011-04-06"/>
