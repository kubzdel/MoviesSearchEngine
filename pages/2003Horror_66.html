'''''The Manson Family''''' is a 1997 American [[Crime film|crime]] [[drama]] [[horror film|horror]] film. The film covers the lives of [[Charles Manson]] and his "family" of followers.

==Overview==
''The Manson Family'' is a cross between fictional story and [[documentary]], overseeing the crimes of [[The Manson Family]] as led by [[Charles Manson|Charlie Manson]]. The fictional story centers on a ''[[Crime Scene (US TV series)|Crime Scene]]''-esque TV series of the same name and its host, Jack Wilson (Carl Day). It is filmed in semi-experimental style and focuses on the early days of the Spahn Ranch including Manson's attempts to record a music album,  and the Manson family crimes, with little emphasis on courtroom drama regarding the trial, although some scenes depict Manson's followers outside the courthouse.

==Production==
The film had a long and troubled production history. Director [[Jim Van Bebber]] personally financed the production starting in 1988, and then continued to shoot it sporadically on weekends and off days.

Despite support from various people, including members of the band [[Skinny Puppy]], who provided a musical score (in the form of [[Download (band)|Download]]'s ''[[Charlie's Family]]'' album) that was released separately years before the film itself, the film remained incomplete. It screened on video as a work-in-progress at a number of film festivals during that time.

In 2004, Dark Sky Films stepped in with the funds to finish the film properly, and it has since been released theatrically and on home video.

[[Phil Anselmo]] of [[Pantera]], [[Down (band)|Down]], and [[Superjoint Ritual]] provided his voice as [[Devil|Satan]].

==Classification==
Despite not being [[List of banned films|banned]] in any country in the world, it is classified harshly in almost all countries of the world due to its [[graphic violence]] and [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]].
