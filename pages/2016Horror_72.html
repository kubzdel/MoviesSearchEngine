A third ''Ghostbusters'' film had been in various stages of development following the release of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989.

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->
Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are authors of a research book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomena, such as ghosts. While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at [[Columbia University]], disowned the work, fearing it will impact her [[Academic tenure|tenure]]. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange by helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erin's belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves "Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a [[receptionist]].

[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillian's [[Proton pack|proton containment laser]], but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, "Ghostbusters". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed [[hearse]], "[[Ecto-1]]".

Unbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an [[occultist]] attempting to bring about the [[apocalypse]]. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural [[debunker]] Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) are aware of New York's ghost problem. While privately supporting the team's work, the mayor's office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.

The Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along [[ley line]]s, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in [[Times Square]], a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers a copy of her and Abby's book among Rowan's possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.

Rowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters' logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1's nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayor's office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters' research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters. Patty listens to a recording of a ghost encounter and asks the others if they have heard of [[Gozer|Zuul]].

===Development===
A third ''Ghostbusters'' film had been in various stages of development following the release of ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' in 1989.<ref name="Murrayexplains">{{cite web|last1=O'Connell|first1=Sean|title=Bill Murray Finally Explains Why He Kept Passing On Ghostbusters 3|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Bill-Murray-Finally-Explains-Why-He-Kept-Passing-Ghostbusters-3-67711.html|website=Cinema Blend|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/471237/long-troubled-history-newghostbustersmovie-timeline|title=The long, troubled history of the new Ghostbusters movie: A timeline|first=Scott| last=Meslow|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[The Week]]}}</ref> [[Bill Murray]], who played Ghostbuster [[Peter Venkman]] in the original films, was reluctant to participate as he felt ''Ghostbusters II'' had been lackluster and was critical of new scripts he had seen. [[Dan Aykroyd]], who co-starred in and co-wrote the original films, stated that the studio was aware that "without Murray there may be nothing there" for a sequel, and was considering a way to bring on a newer generation of Ghostbusters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/ghostbusters-reboot-will-bill-murray-return-in-smaller-role-1201330132/|title=‘Ghostbusters’ Reboot: Will Bill Murray Return in Smaller Role?|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> One script, ''Ghostbusters 3: Hellbent'', written by Aykroyd in 1999, had Venkman leaving the Ghostbusters to spend time with [[Sigourney Weaver]]'s character Dana Barrett; the remaining Ghostbusters, including a new younger member, fought souls that had been evicted from a hellish version of Manhattan known as Manhelltan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/07/30/ign-filmforce-exclusive-the-stax-report-script-review-of-ghostbusters-3-hellbent|title=IGN Filmforce Exclusive: The Stax Report: Script Review of Ghostbusters 3: Hellbent!|author=Stax|date=July 30, 2002|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[IGN]]}}</ref> The ''Hellbent'' script was revised as ''Ghostbusters in Hell'', with plans to replace Murray with [[Ben Stiller]]. The story had the Ghostbusters finding a portal to an alternate dimension in which "all the worst things about modern urban life" are "magnified"; traffic is stuck in perpetual gridlock and no two people speak the same language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/movies/ramis-plans-ghostbusters-3-with-stiller-57152611/|title=Ramis Plans ‘Ghostbusters 3’ with Stiller|date=November 6, 2005|accessdate=July 29, 2016|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]}}</ref> Another story idea had Venkman transformed into a ghost.<ref name="Murrayexplains"/>

The third film remained on the writing table for several years, during which ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' was developed by [[Terminal Reality]] and released in 2009. Aykroyd and [[Harold Ramis]], cowriters of the original films, used the game to explore the Ghostbusters{{'}} history; all four original actors, including Murray, voiced their characters, along with other actors from the original films. Aykroyd considered the game to be "essentially the third movie".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nowgamer.com/dan-aykroyd-on-ghostbusters-game/|title=Dan Aykroyd on Ghostbusters game|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=Now Gamer}}</ref> The game sold over a million units, prompting Columbia to move forward on the ''Ghostbusters'' franchise. Ramis stated that the new film would feature the original Ghostbusters but introduce new characters in a script written with [[Lee Eisenberg]] and [[Gene Stupnitsky]], who had cowritten his 2009 comedy ''[[Year One (film)|Year One]].'' The movie was set to be filmed in 2010 and released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heebmagazine.com/ramis-on-_ghostbusters-3_-plans-to-shoot-next-summer-and-release-in-2011|title=Ramis on Ghostbusters 3: "Plans to Shoot Next Summer and Release in 2011"|first=Brian|last=Abrams|date=December 29, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Heeb Magazine]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/features/columbia-calls-up-new-ghostbusters-1117991624/|title=Columbia calls up new ‘Ghostbusters’|first=Michael|last=Flemming|date=September 4, 2008|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>

Around March 2010, while the new script was being developed, ''Vulture'' reported that Columbia wanted to target a younger audience and that original ''Ghostbusters'' director [[Ivan Reitman]] was under pressure to step down in place of a younger director. ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' reported that Reitman, along with Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis, had long-standing contracts in place with Columbia that effectively allow any of them to veto the development of a ''Ghostbusters'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/03/ghostbusters_3_ivan_reitman.html|title=Vulture Exclusive: Columbia Wants a Younger Director for Ghostbusters III, But Ivan Reitman’s Contract Says Otherwise|first=Claude|last=Brodesser-Akner|work=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=March 17, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> Murray had told ''[[GQ]]'' in 2010 that he felt the script written by Eisenberg and Stupnitsky was poor and "that dream just vaporized", but said that Columbia was pressuring him to make it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/bill-murray-dan-fierman-gq-interview|title=Bill Murray Is Ready To See You Now|first=Dan|last=Fierman|date=July 18, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[GQ]]}}</ref> Aykroyd defended the script, saying that it offered Murray "the comic role of a lifetime".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/10/dan-akroyd-writing-ghostbusters-3-script-selling-vodka-out-of-his-rv|title=DAN AYKROYD WRITING GHOSTBUSTERS 3 SCRIPT, SELLING VODKA OUT OF HIS RV|first=Susan |last=Michels|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] }}</ref> The script languished as they tried to resolve the disagreement, and in January 2012 Aykroyd stated that the film was in "suspended animation" as Murray was still uncooperative. Aykroyd refused to recast the role as he would not make a film that "exploits the franchise".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/9097816/Dan-Aykroyd-a-comedy-legends-spiritual-side.html|title=Dan Aykroyd: a comedy legend's spiritual side|first=Chrissey|last=Iley|date=February 28, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}</ref> By July 2012, the Eisenberg/Stupnitsky script had been discarded and new writing staff were working on a script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/ghostbusters-3/|title=Dan Aykroyd Says GHOSTBUSTERS 3 Has a New Writing Team | first=Dave|last=Trumbore|date=July 3, 2012|accessdate=July 29, 2016|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>

Feig said that Sony Entertainment's [[Amy Pascal]] had been pushing for comedy writers to produce a script for a new ''Ghostbusters'' film for some time, but he believed that most of these writers, like himself, did not want to ruin the [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] of the original films. He also wanted to avoid a premise similar to ''Ghostbusters II'', in which the Ghostbusters have to lose their success to begin a new story. This led to the idea of a reboot featuring a new set of characters, an idea that Pascal agreed with.<ref name="wired feig july2016">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/07/paul-feig-ghostbusters-qa/|title=Ghostbusters Director Paul Feig Talks Haters, Slime, and Sexism|last=Rafterty|first=Brian|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref>

Stand-ins for the ghosts were created on the set for the actors to interact with, including actresses suspended by wires, [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s as references for flying ghosts, a [[Slimer]] puppet and giant balloons for a [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] parade balloon.

The climactic Times Square sequence, which starts with the antagonist proclaiming "Welcome to the glory days of New York City", used special effects to transform it into a [[Times Square#1960s–1980s|bygone mix]] of stores, buildings and billboards dating back through the decades, including [[Bond Clothing Stores#New York City|Bond Clothing Store]], neon signs for the defunct airlines [[Braniff International Airways]] (ended in 1982) and [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] (ended in 1974), billboards advertising the release of the 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and the 1971 film ''[[Isle of the Snake People]]'' and the 1962 to 1964 [[Broadway theatre]] production of ''[[Beyond the Fringe#International Success|Beyond the Fringe]]'', a combination of the [[Sony]], [[Canadian Club]] and [[Coca-Cola]] neon signs that light up Times Square in different eras, marquees for long departed Times Square movie theatres showing [[Pornography|XXX]] films and the 1971 film ''[[Fists of Fury]]'', and other chronological anachronisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/how-ghostbusters-re-created-a-bizarro-times-211201128.html |title=How 'Ghostbusters' Re-Created a Bizarro Times Square |last=Korn |first=Steve |work=[[Yahoo!

In a June 2017 television appearance, Aykroyd blamed the film's underperformance on Feig. According to Aykroyd, Feig refused to shoot additional scenes requested by Aykroyd and Sony until test screenings demonstrated they were necessary, costing an additional $30–40 million in [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|reshoots]] (although Sony claimed reshoots only cost $3–4 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/06/aykroyd-blasts-paul-feig-in-tv-interview-1202107198/|title=Dan Aykroyd Blames Director Paul Feig for 'Ghostbusters' Reboot|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=June 4, 2017|accessdate=August 8, 2017}}</ref> He wrote a few days later: "Paul Feig made a good movie and had a superb cast and plenty of money to do it.

''Ghostbusters'' received criticism from [[social media]] users following word of Feig's involvement and the all-female cast, which some felt was a "gimmick".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/04/showbiz/movies/paul-feig-ghostbusters/|title='Ghostbusters' reboot: Paul Feig, and an all-women cast?|last=Hare|first=Breeanna|date=August 4, 2014|work=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 28, 2016}}</ref> On its first day of release, the first trailer for the film collected 12,000 "likes" and 13,800 "dislikes" from YouTube viewers which, according to David Griner of ''[[Ad Week]]'' made it "one of the most polarizing in recent memory".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/reactions-all-female-ghostbusters-trailer-prove-itll-be-most-polarizing-movie-year-169984|title=Reactions to the All-Female Ghostbusters Trailer Prove It'll Be the Most Polarizing Movie of the Year|last=Griner|first=David|date=March 3, 2016|publisher=Ad Week|accessdate=March 16, 2016}}</ref> By May 2016, the trailer had become the most disliked film trailer on YouTube<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36191146|title=Ghostbusters trailer 'most disliked' on YouTube|date=May 3, 2016|work=BBC News|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}</ref> and the ninth-[[List of most-disliked YouTube videos|most-disliked YouTube video]], with 280,000 likes to over one million dislikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/youtube-dislikes-controversy-sonys-new-895442|title=After YouTube "Dislikes" Controversy, Sony's New 'Ghostbusters' Trailer Debuts Elsewhere First|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=May 18, 2016|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/all-female-ghostbusters-already-fending-controversy|title=All-female ‘Ghostbusters’ already fending off controversy|last=Howard|first=Adam|date=March 9, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/6/30/12027882/ghostbusters-reboot-all-female-backlash-sexism-sony|title=How the all-female Ghostbusters reboot became a lightning rod of controversy|last=Framke|first=Caroline|date=July 15, 2016|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> [[ScreenCrush]] described the reaction as a campaign "to downvote [the film] into oblivion" by "a certain subset of people on the internet [with] an unhealthy fixation with hating on the ''Ghostbusters'' remake".<ref name="bbc"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/ghostbusters-trailer-most-disliked-movie-trailer-in-history/?trackback=tsmclip|title=Why the ‘Ghostbusters’ Trailer Is the Most ‘Disliked’ Movie Trailer in YouTube History|date=April 29, 2016|last1=Sampson|first1=Mike|work=Screen Crush|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref> In one interview, Melissa McCarthy felt it was a "very, very, very tiny, tiny group of people" who were misogynistic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/ghostbuster-melissa/2954166.html|title=Ghostbuster Melissa McCarthy on who she wants to slime in real life|first=Genevieve Sarah|last= Loh|publisher=Channel News Asia|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> Other reasons proposed for the negative reaction to the trailer included a lack of interest in reboots, nostalgia for the original film, and a perceived lack of humor in the trailer.<ref name="atlantic outcry">{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/05/the-sexist-outcry-against-the-ghostbusters-remake-gets-louder/483270/|title=The Ongoing Outcry Against the Ghostbusters Remake|date=May 18, 2016|website=The Atlantic|last1=Sims|first1=David|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}</ref> The film's [[IMDb]] page was also subject to vote brigading in a coordinated effort to lower its rating.<ref name="Hayes"/><ref name="Hickey"/>

Filmmaker [[James Rolfe]], creator of the ''[[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'' series, declared that he would not see the new film and disliked how it was based in a new universe with no continuity to the previous films.<ref name="atlantic outcry"/><ref name="nytimes rolfe 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/ghostbusters-frozen-and-strange-entitlement-fan-cu-237139|title=Ghostbusters, Frozen, and the strange entitlement of fan culture|last=Hassenger|first=Jesse|date=May 25, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2016|work=[[The A.V.

While speaking at [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture Festival LA]] in November 2017, Feig expressed regret that the [[social issue]]s surrounding ''Ghostbusters'' negatively impacted its public perception and commercial performance, stating that "I think it kind of hampered us a little bit because the movie became so much of a cause. I think for some of our audience, they were like, 'What the fuck? We don't wanna go to a cause. We just wanna watch a fuckin' movie'". However, he expressed satisfaction with his work on the film and defended it, explaining "It was a great regret in my life that the movie didn't do better, 'cause I really loved it. It's not a perfect movie. None of my movies are perfect. I liked what we were doing with it. It was only supposed to be there to entertain people".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ferber|first1=Taylor|title=Paul Feig Regrets That His Ghostbusters Remake Turned Into a ‘Cause’|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/paul-feig-regrets-that-ghostbusters-remake-became-a-cause.html|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=2017-11-21|language=en|date=2017-11-20}}</ref>

==Future of the franchise==
After its opening weekend, Sony's president of worldwide distribution, Rory Bruer, told ''[[TheWrap]]'' that "while nothing has been officially announced, there's no doubt in [his] mind [a sequel] will happen." He also said that ''Ghostbusters'' is expected to become an important Sony franchise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Venter |first=Jason |url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/18/12211904/ghostbusters-sequel-sony |title=Sony has plans for a Ghostbusters sequel |publisher=Polygon |date=2016-07-18 |accessdate=2017-02-08}}</ref> The principal cast and director had signed on for two sequels.<ref name="HWR8"/>
