'''''Frankenstein''''' is a 2004 made-for-television [[USA Network]] production starring [[Thomas Kretschmann]] as Victor Helios (supposedly the man that the fictional character [[Victor Frankenstein]] was based on) and [[Vincent Pérez]] as his [[Frankenstein monster|creature]].  It was produced by [[Martin Scorsese]] and based on [[Dean Koontz]]'s [[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein|version of ''Frankenstein'']]. The film was originally intended as the [[pilot episode|pilot]] for an ongoing series, but this was not successful.  Koontz later developed the concept into a series of five novels: ''Frankenstein: Prodigal Son'', ''Frankenstein: City of Night'', ''Frankenstein: Dead and Alive'', ''Frankenstein: Lost Souls'', and ''Frankenstein: The Dead Town''.

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
This is not a direct adaptation of the [[Mary Shelley]] [[Frankenstein|novel]], but a [[postmodern]] [[Gothic novel|gothic]] reinvention set in present-day [[New Orleans]]. It recasts the doctor as the villain and the creature as a [[tragic hero]] determined to stop him; the primary action involves two police detectives ([[Parker Posey]] and [[Adam Goldberg]]) who enlist the aid of the creature ("[[Deucalion]]" in this version) to stop a [[serial killer]] who is one of Victor's later creations.

==Reception==
Sloan Freer of ''[[Radio Times]]'' gave the film two stars and said "though the ultra-stylised visuals create an air of brooding menace, they can't compensate for the patchy plotting or the abrupt and hugely unsatisfying finale."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/jzhyq/frankenstein/ |title=Frankenstein  |last=Freer |first=Sloane |website=[[Radio Times]] |access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref> Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the look saying "Even working on a made-for-TV budget, Nispel provides plenty of striking imagery, giving the film a truly distinctive look" and added "while the climax is somewhat disappointing, the brisk story until then leaves ample room to speculate as to where a series would go with Helios’ creations roaming the Earth."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/markets-festivals/frankenstein-7-1200530458/ |title=Frankenstein |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=2004-10-07 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=2017-11-22}}</ref>
