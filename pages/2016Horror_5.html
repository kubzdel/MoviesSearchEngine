'''''1920 London''''' is an Indian [[horror film]] directed by [[Tinu Suresh Desai]]. It is the third installment in the [[1920 (film series)]],<ref name="times">{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/1920-London-to-release-by-March-April-2015-Meera-Chopra/articleshow/45759026.cms|title=1920 London to release by February-March 2016: Meera Chopra|work=indiatimes.com}}</ref> after ''[[1920 (film)|1920]]'' and ''[[1920: The Evil Returns]]''. The film stars [[Sharman Joshi]], [[Meera Chopra]], and [[Vishal Karwal]] in lead roles. The film managed to recover its cost and became a moderate success but it couldn't repeat the success of its previous installments, still it was followed by another installment titled 1921.

==Plot==
The film opens with the life of Shivangi, the princess of a royal house in [[Sikar]], [[Rajasthan]], now living in [[London]] with her husband Kunwar Veer Singh. They are a happy couple until one day when Veer develops a minor illness that soon flares up into a disease, shriveling his body and shrinking his head. Veer is hospitalized and his symptoms worsen - his body begins to contort unnaturally and he begins growling in strange languages. The doctors seem to diagnose it as [[tetanus]], which is incurable. Shivangi is frightened; Veer is just not the same and Shivangi's handmaiden, Kesar Ma deems it [[black magic]].

Kesar Ma thinks it is because Veer's father, the King, had two wives and the second wife wanted Veer, the heir, out of the way. The film moves to Rajasthan, where Shivangi and her family visit an exorcist for Veer's condition. This exorcist attempts to confront the witch by entering the other realm, through a mirror, but is soon thrown out, too powerless for the witch. The exorcist refers the King to the most powerful spiritual master in the land, Mewar Baba, also known as Jai Singh Gujjar. 

Shivangi shudders on hearing about Jai. She was deeply in love with Jai some years ago. Her uncle saw them together and tried to blackmail the helpless and beautiful Shivangi into sleeping with him. Jai stepped in between and fought off the uncle who promptly reported the matter to the King. Jai was charged with attempted murder. Shivangi inexplicably stood as witness against Jai and Jai was ultimately sent to jail for five years. Shivangi contacts Jai to help her save her husband. Jai flatly refuses but Shivangi pleads and persuades him to help, and Jai finally agrees to come to London.

Jai investigates the matter and discovers that Veer's troubles began upon receiving a strange amulet as a gift from an unknown admirer in Rajasthan. The amulet transmitted the witch demon into Veer. Jai prepares Shivangi into reciting a spiritual chant to bind the witch to their mansion so Jai can throw the locket into the [[Thames]] river, thereby freeing Veer. Shivangi maintains the chant over the witch's attempt to thwart it and Jai finishes the task. However, it is revealed that the amulet and the witch were actually dispatched by Jai, and as he prepares to leave London, Shivangi confronts him, asking him how he knew the source of the amulet. Jai admits his vengeance saying that he wanted Veer dead. Shivangi reveals why she had betrayed him many years ago: When their affair was revealed, the King had ordered Jai killed. Shivangi had begged for his life and it was granted for the price of her betrayal. Now guilty and dismayed, Jai resolves to stay in London and free Veer from the witch.

Jai prepares his final assault on the witch. Jai invokes his own spiritual master through a letter. The master chastises Jai for acting in haste and then regretfully says that the witch will not leave without taking a soul. The master directs Jai to an abandoned church where he receives a set of charmed [[Celts|Celtic]] daggers. Jai prepares a charm to attack the witch. He enters the witch's realm through a mirror and recovers the amulet. The witch attacks ferociously and is about to stop Shivangi when Jai smashes the mirror, closing the portal and trapping himself in the realm, so Shivangi can burn the amulet and free her husband. Shivangi sees Jai smile peacefully from a last shattered piece of the mirror before it breaks as Veer comes to life. Some weeks later, Veer and Shivangi find the letter of correspondence between Jai and his master. Jai had offered his soul so Veer could be freed. Veer is touched and places Jai's photograph upon his mantelpiece as the film ends.

==Critical reception== 
The film was panned by the critics.
[[Koimoi.com]] gave the film 1.5/5 stars and wrote, "Where do we start? A lazy writing, poor direction and an even more unconvincing act!"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Redkar|first1=Surabhi|title=1920 London Review|url=http://www.koimoi.com/reviews/1920-london-review/|website=Koimoi.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> Mohar Basu of ''[[Times Of India]]'' gave the film 1/5 stars and wrote,"There isn't an inkling of innovative thinking in the third installment of the 1920 series. The  best thing that can be said about it is that it will remain one of the year's funniest films".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Basu|first1=Mohar|title=1920 London Movie Review|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/1920-London/movie-review/52149079.cms?from=mdr|website=Times Of India|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>  Soumyata of Bollywood Life, also gave 1.5/5 stars to the film and wrote, "While film had a good twist post interval, it wasn't surprising. Except for the gender reversal, as here the wife is saving the husband, the plot is similar to the first 1920 film, Needless to say, the latest entry in the 1920 series disappoints big time, with Sharman Joshi being the only saving grace, Watch the film only if you don't have anything else to do". {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Manjusha of ''[[Gulf News]]'' gave 1.5/5 to the film and wrote,"Vikram Bhatt exhausts every cliche that has been regurgitated in Bollywood love stories. Corny dialogues such as "we will live together and die together" and sappy songs with lovers dancing around in picturesque locations will make you nauseous. While the first few scenes in which evil spirit unleashes her fury are startling, it gets tiring" {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}.
