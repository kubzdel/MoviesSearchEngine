==Plot==
After narrowly escaping from an ancient burial ground, long forgotten and buried underneath the marshes of [[Cape Cod]], a group of friends emerge from the thick, marshy darkness, tattered and bloody, lucky to be alive. They have already lost two of their friends in the marsh, presumably dead. They stumble upon an empty Cape Cod vacation house alongside the foggy marsh and break in to take shelter. Whatever was in the marsh is still after them and, soon after one of them goes for help, the rest of the group learns that the evil in the marsh is not the only thing that wants them dead. Something worse, something more savage, is lying in wait just outside the marsh, in the house. The unlucky travelers spend their [[St. Patrick's Day]] trapped between two evils, forcing them to fight, die, or go back the way they came.

==Reception==
The no apologies sexuality of Muck polarized audiences and critics, while still receiving major distribution. Or as one reviewer put it “against all odds” Anchor Bay Entertainment distributed the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=MUCK (2015)|url=http://www.thefilmfile.com/reviews/m/15_muck.htm|publisher=The Film File|accessdate=7 May 2017}}</ref> Further, the truly independent horror film was highly anticipated and widely reviewed. Including pieces from major reviewers at the LA Times and Village Voice, to the niche like Bloody Disgusting and The Fright File.

While critics generally agreed that the overt sexuality of the film was an attempt for Muck to be "a throwback to old-school horror",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Torfe|first1=Pat|title=[Review] ‘Muck’ Is An Incoherent Waste of Time|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3338104/review-muck-incoherent-waste-time/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref> reviews were mixed as some critics found Muck’s sex appeal distracting.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tsai|first1=Martin|title=Review 'Muck' a glib and hollow attempt at horror|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-muck-movie-review-20150313-story.html?|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref> Still, some negative reviews praised Muck’s look and camerawork.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Meek|first1=Tom|title=Muck|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/03/muck.html|publisher=Paste Magazine|accessdate=May 7, 2017}}</ref>

Others saw the film’s scantily clad characters as an attraction, for instance, [[Ain't It Cool News]] wrote "About as subtle as a stripper in church, don’t expect your brain to be stimulated, but other areas (specifically your guts and below) are bound to be rumbled when you wade through ''MUCK''."<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR looks at DANNY’S DOOMSDAY!
