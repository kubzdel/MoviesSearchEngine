'''''Underworld''''' is a 2003 [[Action film|action]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Len Wiseman]] and written by [[Danny McBride (writer)|Danny McBride]], based on a story by McBride, [[Kevin Grevioux]], and Wiseman. The film centers on the [[secret history]] of [[Vampire (Underworld)|vampires]] and [[Lycan (Underworld)|lycans]] (an abbreviated form of ''[[Werewolf|lycanthrope]]'', which means werewolf). It is the first installment in the [[Underworld (film series)|''Underworld'' franchise]]. The main plot revolves around [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]] ([[Kate Beckinsale]]), a vampire [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealer]] hunting Lycans. She finds herself attracted to a human, [[Michael Corvin]] ([[Scott Speedman]]), who is being targeted by the Lycans. After Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and save him. Alongside Beckinsale and Speedman, the film stars [[Michael Sheen]], [[Shane Brolly]], and [[Bill Nighy]].

An [[international co-production]] between companies from [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], [[Cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[Cinema of Hungary|Hungary]], and [[Cinema of the United States|the United States]], the film was released on September 19, 2003. Upon its release, the film received generally negative reviews from critics, but a smaller number of reviewers praised elements such as the film's stylish [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] visuals, the "icy English composure" in Kate Beckinsale's performance, and the extensively worked-out vampire–werewolf [[mythology]] that serves as the film's [[backstory]]. A [[sleeper hit|surprise hit]], the film grossed $95 million against a production budget of $22 million. The film was followed by ''[[Underworld: Evolution]]'', released three years later, and by three other films.

==Plot==
For generations, a secret war has been waged between [[vampires]] and [[Lycanthropy|Lycans]], an ancient species of [[werewolf]]. [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]], a [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealer]], a vampire specialized in assassinating Lycans, tracks two Lycans. Selene's motivation goes beyond duty; she also wants revenge because, 600 years ago when she was a child, Lycans slaughtered her family. The vampires believe they defeated the werewolves many centuries ago and killed their leader, [[Lucian (Underworld)|Lucian]], and that they must kill the surviving Lycans. Selene locates the Lycans' den and learns they have developed a new kind of [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV]] bullet capable of killing vampires.

Later, Selene arrives at the mansion of her vampire coven and, recounting these events, urges an attack on the Lycans; but the vampire [[regent]], [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]], dismisses her proposal. Selene determines that the pair of Lycans may have been following a human, [[Michael Corvin]], and continues her investigation. In a Lycan lair, a scientist named Singe tests blood from kidnapped descendants of the ancient Corvinus family, trying to find a pure source of the ancient and powerful Corvinus bloodline. Soon after Selene finds Michael, the pair are attacked by Lycans, including their leader, who is revealed to be Lucian. Lucian bites Michael, but Selene helps Michael escape and the two become attracted to each other.

Selene discovers that Kraven was the only witness to Lucian's supposed death. Sensing a conspiracy, she awakens a dormant powerful vampire elder, [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], who has been [[hibernating]]. Viktor is angered by his early awakening, as it was [[Markus Corvinus (Underworld)|Markus]]' turn to rule the coven. Viktor believes Kraven and orders Selene to acquiesce to the vampire [[hierarchy]]. Kraven, meanwhile, has secretly planned to kill the third vampire elder, [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]], and her companions with Lucian's help.

Selene informs Michael about the feud and her past. She then binds him, fearing that he will kill innocent people after he changes into his Lycan form at the coming night's full moon. Selene captures Singe while Michael is captured by Lycans. Selene returns to the mansion with Singe, who admits to Viktor that the Lycans are trying to combine the [[bloodline]]s of the two species with the Corvinus Strain, the shared source of both the Vampire and Lycan bloodlines, to create a powerful [[Hybrid (Underworld)|hybrid]]. After Kraven flees the mansion because Singe has revealed his cooperation with Lucian, news arrives that Amelia, who was coming to awaken Markus, has been killed by Lycans. Viktor kills Singe and tasks Selene to kill Michael.

While Michael is being held captive, he learns from Lucian that Viktor's daughter, [[Sonja (Underworld)|Sonja]], and Lucian were lovers. Lucian tells Michael that the Lycans were slaves to the vampires. When Viktor learned that his daughter had been impregnated by a Lycan, he killed her to prevent any crossing of the two species, which led to the war. According to Lucian, such a crossing would create a hybrid creature that would be more powerful than both the vampires and Lycans.

Selene arrives with a group of Death Dealers to kill the Lycans and Kraven for his treachery. Kraven shoots Lucian with a newly designed bullet that kills by poisoning a Lycan's bloodstream with [[silver nitrate]]. Selene rescues Michael, who is shot by Kraven. Kraven tells Selene it was Viktor who killed her family. Lucian stabs Kraven in the leg and convinces Selene to bite Michael, transmitting the vampire virus into his bloodstream. Selene complies, and Kraven flees after killing Lucian. Viktor arrives and admits that he killed Selene's family, though he believes she should be grateful as he spared her and made her immortal. He reveals the truth of his love for Sonja – that his choice to have her killed was to protect the vampires and that he must now kill Michael to protect the vampires. Selene eventually kills Viktor with the assistance of Michael, who is now a hybrid. Selene and Michael leave the Lycan lair, now enemies of both species. At the mansion, blood from Singe's corpse seeps into the [[sarcophagus]] of a hibernating elder, Markus, a carrier of the original Corvinus Strain.

==Legal controversy==
The film was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by [[White Wolf, Inc.]] and [[Nancy A. Collins]], claiming the setting was too similar to the ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' and ''[[Werewolf: The Apocalypse]]'' games, both set in the ''[[World of Darkness]]'' setting, and to the ''[[Sonja Blue]]'' vampire novels. White Wolf filed 17 counts of copyright infringement, and claimed over 80 points of unique similarity between White Wolf's gaming systems and the film. White Wolf, Inc. also said the script was very similar to a story entitled ''The Love of Monsters'' (1994), which they published, written by Nancy A. Collins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.white-wolf.com/News/underworldrelease.html |title=WHITE WOLF, INC. and author NANCY A.

==Box office==
The film grossed $51,970,690 in the US and $95,708,457 worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=underworld.htm|title=Underworld (2003)|publisher=''[[Box Office Mojo]]''}}</ref> ''Underworld'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[VHS]] from Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.

==Reception==
As of January 2012, ''Underworld'' has a 31% overall approval rating on film-critics' aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 157 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "Though stylish to look at, ''Underworld'' is tedious and derivative." Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore"> {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}</ref>

[[Roger Ebert]] said, "This is a movie so paltry in its characters and shallow in its story that the war seems to exist primarily to provide graphic visuals".<ref>Roger Ebert, [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030919/REVIEWS/309190308/1023 Underworld Moovie Review & Film Summary (2003)]</ref> However, some critics were more favorable: the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' praised it as being "stylish and cruel, and mightily entertaining for certain covens out there".<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NxKzXC83ZasJ:articles.nydailynews.com/2003-09-19/entertainment/18246668_1_bill-nighy-vampire-underworld] {{dead link|date=August 2013}}</ref>

''Salon'' reviewer Andrew O'Hehir gave mixed criticism and praise, stating, "[B]y any reasonable standard, this dark vampire epic — all massive overacting, cologne-commercial design and sexy cat suits — sucks," but that "...at least it gives a crap", conceding that despite the movie's flaws, the complex vampire-werewolf mythology backstory "has been meticulously worked out".<ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2003/09/19/underworld/index.html "Underworld" - Salon.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606162031/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2003/09/19/underworld/index.html |date=June 6, 2011 }}</ref>

The film's soundtrack was produced by [[Danny Lohner]] and distributed via [[Roadrunner Records]].
Lohner (born 1970), a bass guitarist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has recorded with [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Marilyn Manson]], contributed several songs to the soundtrack under the pseudonym [[Renholdër]]. Lohner included a song by [[Skinny Puppy]], a Canadian [[Industrial music|industrial]] band; a song by [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]], a US band which performs an aggressive, technical style of hardcore punk called [[mathcore]]; a song by US alternative rock/post-hardcore band [[Finch (U.S. band)|Finch]] entitled "Worms of the Earth"; a song by [[The Icarus Line]], a band known for its abrasive form of rock music; and [[Lisa Germano]], an American singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who specializes in alternative rock and [[dream pop]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Music critic Bill Aicher noted that the "soundtrack follow[s] in a similar gothic vein" to the visuals, and stated that it "does an excellent job setting the dark mood" by using "a veritable who's who in the genre", with an "impressive array of metal, hard rock, industrial, and otherwise gothic-themed tracks".<ref name="Aicher">"Maynard and Borland and Bowie, Oh My!". Music review by Bill Aicher http://www.music-critic.com/sdtrks/underworld.htm</ref> Aicher noted that since "a majority of the selections [are] written, produced, or featuring Lohner, the album retains a sense of cohesion throughout, making it much more a complete product than has generally been the case with similarly-themed products."<ref name="Aicher" /> He stated that the "album's highest point" is the song with [[Maynard James Keenan]] (from [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and [[A Perfect Circle]]), [[David Bowie]], and guitarist [[John Frusciante]] (of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]), which is entitled "Bring Me the Disco King" (Lohner Mix); he called the song "[d]ark, brooding, sad, and twitchy".<ref name="Aicher" />
