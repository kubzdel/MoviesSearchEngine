==Synopsis==
A group of young people head to Ibiza for the holiday of a lifetime – only to find a zombie outbreak getting in the way. In the world of Ibiza Undead zombies are commonplace and a new strain of virus has started appearing across the globe, rendering its victims as flesh-eating maniacs. Britain has been severely affected, but zombie are managed and frequent checks ensure that no virus carriers make it across the borders. Club owner Karl ([[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]]) decides that deranged podium dancing zombies are just what he needs for his Ibiza nightclub, so he commissions a boat full of them to be smuggled in. His plan backfires and his 'cargo' ends up in the Mediterranean. But the undead don’t stay dead, and when they make their way ashore the holiday paradise of Ibiza soon begins to resemble a war zone. Oblivious to these events, a gang of young British men - Jim, Alex and Az  arrive on the island intent on a good time. Other cast members include [[Cara Theobold]] as Alex's former girlfriend Ellie, [[Inbetweeners]] star [[Emily Atack]] as Alex’s older sister Liz, Algina Lipskis as Zara, and movie pundit [[Alex Zane]] who makes a cameo as a club promoter.

==Reception==
''Hollywood News'' felt that the story moved along nicely but had too many characters, including Big Jim who they found 'a little too crass and sex-obsessed to win the audience over'.<ref name=HN>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Kat|title=Frightfest 2016: ‘Ibiza Undead’ review|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2016/08/26/ibiza-undead-review/|work=Hollywood News|date=2016-08-26|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' gave it three and a half skulls out of five saying "This isn’t a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I’d care to admit...It’s not exactly Shaun of the Dead, but Zombie Spring Breakers is definitely worth a watch."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3467463/review-zombie-spring-breakers-surprisingly-effective-zom-com/ |title=[Review] ‘Zombie Spring Breakers’ Is a Surprisingly Effective Zom-Com |last=H.C. |first=Louis |date=2017-10-31 |website=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> ''Scream Magazine'' panned the film saying "All in all, ''Ibiza Undead'' is a disappointment. What could have been a self-aware, fun and witty romantic zomedy is merely a predictable mess that only serves to secure my general distaste of horror-comedies that only use sex and alcohol to generate laughs."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/ibiza-undead-film-review/ |title=IBIZA UNDEAD: Film Review |last=Williams |first=Jessy |date=2017-04-12 |website=Scream Magazine |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref> ''Wicked Horror'' also disliked the film saying "Unfortunately, Ibiza Undead is mostly, like the lads at the centre of it all, a bit useless. It isn’t particularly funny and the horror elements aren’t strong enough to justify it as a real zombie movie."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wickedhorror.com/horror-reviews/frightfest-2016-review-ibiza-undead/ |title=Frightfest 2016 Review: Ibiza Undead |last=Keogh |first=Joey |date=2016-09-13 |website=Wicked Horror |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>
