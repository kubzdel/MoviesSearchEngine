'''''Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast''''' is a 2012 American [[horror film]] written, directed and photographed by [[Sam Qualiana]], and produced by [[Richard Chizmar]], Marc Makowski, and [[Greg Lamberson]]. The film stars Qualiana alongside Michael O'Hare, Kathy Murphy, [[C. J. Qualiana]], Jackey Hall and [[Andrew Elias]].<ref name=anything /> The film follows the residents of a small town who are terrorized by a prehistoric [[Man-eater|man-eating]] shark that can swim through snow. 

Production on ''Snow Shark'' began in early 2011. The film uses [[practical effect]]s rather than [[computer-generated imagery]], and its budget was partially financed by a campaign on the [[crowdfunding]] website [[Indiegogo]]. The film, which was shot in [[Buffalo, New York]], premiered at [[Dipson Theatres|Dipson's Amherst Theatre]] on April 10, 2012, and received mixed reviews. The film was released on [[DVD]] by Independent Entertainment.

==Plot==
On February 6, 1999, a team of three [[biologist]]s, led by Professor Jonathan Hoffman, investigate a series of supposed wildlife killings in a wooded area near a small [[New York (state)|New York]] town. One of the biologists, Bianca, suspects that the killings may have something to do with a recent earthquake. When Hoffman and the other biologist, Gabriel, go off to investigate the wildlife disappearances, they discover the corpse of a mutilated deer. Upon returning to the campsite, they find that Bianca has discovered a hole in the ground. From this, the group determines that a prehistoric creature that has been frozen for thousands of years was freed by the earthquake, and has been killing the wildlife. The creature appears and kills both Gabriel and Bianca, leaving Hoffman to deduce that it is a "snow shark", before it bites him.

Twelve years later, the snow shark has become a town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is informed when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him having said to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while [[Urination|urinating]]. The next day, with the rest of the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it.

A [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] named Lincoln Anderson, a biologist named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit the town and have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed with guns, Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron make their way into the woods, armed with a [[Crossbow|miniature crossbow]], a shotgun, and a [[Motion detector|motion-sensing camera]]. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.

When Lincoln finds that the camera has not detected any motion, the group sets out into the forest once more. Wendy is dragged away by the shark and killed. The shark attacks Cameron, and Chapman [[Involuntary euthanasia|shoots him in the head]] to end his pain. Hoffman and Mike soon join up with Chapman and Lincoln. Hoffman plans to start a large fire to attract the shark, as he surmises that the heat will confuse it, but it kills him before he can drop a lighter. Mike pulls out a [[hand grenade]] but the shark bites off his legs, and Chapman and Lincoln make the decision to run away. The shark reappears and attempts to kill Mike, but he pulls the grenade's pin, causing them both to explode. After reporting the incident to the police station, Chapman and Lincoln see multiple shark fins in the snow and escape. Later, a woman named Daphne approaches Ethan's grave to lay a wreath, and a shark fin approaches her as she walks out of the graveyard.

==Production==
Production on ''Snow Shark'' began in early 2011, with director Sam Qualiana having created the film's title, poster, and a teaser trailer before finalizing its script.<ref name=prod>{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Debi |date=5 February 2011 |title=Production Under Way on Indie Feature Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/22154/production-under-way-on-indie-feature-snow-shark-ancient-snow-beast/ |website=[[Dread Central]] |access-date=26 June 2016 }}</ref> Qualiana has stated, "I always have had a fear of sharks. Not a lot of things scare me, but sharks terrify and fascinate me at the same time."<ref name=prod /> Qualiana viewed the film as a mixture of the 1975 thriller film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' and the 1982 science-fiction horror film ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]''. The film began shooting in [[Buffalo, New York]], partially supported by an [[Indiegogo]] campaign launched by Qualiana with a fundraising goal of $3,000. Production was met with minor weather-related difficulties, including overcoming cold temperatures and the task of preventing snow from gathering on the lens of the film camera.<ref name=prod />

Aside from instances of blood shown onscreen, the film's visual effects were created without the use of [[computer-generated imagery]]. John Renna, who portrays the character Ethan, constructed a full-size shark head to use during filming.<ref name=wrap>{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Debi |date=12 June 2011 |title=Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast Wraps Production; More Behind-the-Scenes Stills |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/24758/snow-shark-ancient-snow-beast-wraps-production-more-behind-the-scenes-stills/ |website=[[Dread Central]] |access-date=26 June 2016 }}</ref> Effects artists Andrew Lavin and Arick Szymecki created a miniature shark head, as well as several landscapes, to be used in the film. Some of the film's scenes were shot on weekends in order to prevent the melting of snow due to the arrival of spring. Qualiana noted that "it was tough getting all the exterior shots before the snow melted. We cancelled some shoots due to warm weather and managed to do some cutaways outside with fake snow".<ref name=wrap />

Production ended in June 2011, in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]]. Post-production was managed by Qualiana and producer [[Greg Lamberson]], alongside [[B-movie]] horror screenwriter Brett Piper and low-budget filmmaker [[Polonia brothers|Mark Polonia]].<ref name=wrap />

Brett Gallmann of the website ''Oh, the Horror!'' criticized the film's "[[Amateur film|amateurism]], from the acting to the hastily sloshed upon digital effects", likening it to a "no-budget [[Troma Entertainment|Troma]] affair" that "excels at being mostly forgettable".<ref name=horror /> John Lyle of the website Bloodbath & Beyond gave the film a score of 0.5/5, criticizing the brief overall time that the snow shark is shown onscreen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bloodbathandbeyond.tv/snow-shark-ancient-snow-beast-2011-horror-movie-review/|title=Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast (2011) ‚Äì Horror Movie Review|author=Jay Bond|date=11 July 2015|website=Bloodbath & Beyond|access-date=28 February 2017}}</ref>

Nathaniel Thompson of ''Mondo Digital'' wrote that, in regards to "''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' rip-offs", it was "one of the more entertaining ones in recent years".<ref name=mondo>{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Nathaniel |date=9 January 2013 |title=Snow Shark |url=http://www.mondo-digital.com/snowshark.html |website=Mondo Digital |access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> HorrorNews.net found fault with the film's "tiring" dialogue but admired its "charming" special effects, writing that it shows "just enough shark to make us hunger for more".<ref name=hnn>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2 January 2016 |title=Film Review: Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast (2011) |url=http://horrornews.net/67929/film-review-snow-shark-ancient-snow-beast-2011/ |website=HorrorNews.net |access-date=24 June 2016 }}</ref> In a review of the film's DVD release on the website HorrorTalk, the film is referred to as "bad, real bad, but in all the most awesome ways possible".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/movie-reviews/3183-snow-shark-ancient-snow-beast-dvd-review.html|title=Snow Shark: Ancient Snow Beast DVD Review|date=10 February 2013|website=HorrorTalk|access-date=28 February 2017}}</ref>
