'''''Halloween: Resurrection''''' is a 2002 American [[slasher film]] and the eighth installment in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' franchise. Directed by [[Rick Rosenthal]], who had also directed ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' in 1981, the film builds upon the continuity of ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]''. Larry Brand and [[Sean Hood]] devised the screenplay. It continues with the masked serial killer [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield. Yet, this time, the killer's old, derelict childhood home is being used for a live internet horror show. It stars [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Bianca Kajlich]], [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]], [[Ryan Merriman]], [[Sean Patrick Thomas]], [[Katee Sackhoff]], [[Daisy McCrackin]], [[Luke Kirby]] and [[Tyra Banks]], with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] reprising her role as [[Laurie Strode]].

''Halloween: Resurrection'' was released on July 12, 2002, to widely negative critical reviews, having just a 12% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref name=rotten>{{cite web|title=Halloween: Resurrection|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/halloween_resurrection/|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}</ref> with many claiming it was an unnecessary sequel to the ''H20'' film. Despite the heavy criticism, ''Resurrection'' was somewhat of a box office success, with over $30 million made in the box office. Although more sequels were planned to follow ''Resurrection'', the series was eventually [[Reboot (media)|rebooted]] with [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]''.

==Plot==
On [[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later|October 31, 1998]], [[Laurie Strode]] accidentally kills a paramedic with whom her brother [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] had swapped clothes. The guilt-ridden Laurie is now an inmate at the Grace Andersen Sanitarium, where the nurses believe her to be [[catatonic]]. Instead, she is preparing for Michael's return,

On October 30, 2001, Laurie, pretending to be heavily medicated, prepares herself for the inevitable confrontation with her brother. Michael breaches the facility and kills two security guards, decapitating one and slitting the throat of the other as he makes his way to Laurie. After a chase, Laurie lures Michael on to the institution's rooftop. Although he falls into her trap, Laurie's fears of again killing the wrong person get the better of her; when she tries to remove his mask, Michael stabs her and throws her off the roof, to her death. His life mission is finally  complete after more than twenty years of tracking Laurie down, Michael returns home to his abandoned childhood house.

The following year, college students Bill Woodlake, Donna Chang, Jen Danzig, Jim Morgan, Rudy Grimes, and Sara Moyer win a competition to appear on an Internet reality show ''Dangertainment'', directed by Freddie Harris and his friend, Nora Winston, in which they have to spend a night in Michael's home in order to figure out what led him to kill. On Halloween, equipped with head-cameras as well as the cameras throughout the house, they search the house and separate into three groups. Sara's messaging friend Deckard watches the broadcast during a Halloween party. Meanwhile, Michael suddenly appears and stabs Bill in the head, and kills a cameraman.

Donna and Jim begin getting intimate in the basement and a wall filled with corpses falls on them. Jim realizes the corpses are fake and the show is a setup. Jim leaves, but Donna notices a tunnel behind the fallen wall. Myers chases her through the tunnels before impaling her on a spike on the wall. At the party, Deckard and other partygoers witness the murder. Deckard realizes that the murder was real, but the others believe it is an act. Freddie goes through the house dressed as Michael, but is secretly followed by the real Myers. Freddie, mistaking Michael for Charlie (the cameraman who had been killed earlier), tells him to go to the garage and help Nora out; he goes to the garage and promptly kills Nora.

When Rudy, Sara, and Jim find Freddie in the Myers costume, he reveals the scheme to them and begs them to cooperate, telling them that he's set up a nice payday for all of them. When he leaves, the trio decides to gather up the other three and leave. But before they can, Jen discovers the body of Bill (who was stabbed in the head and vanished earlier) and is decapitated by Myers right in front of Rudy, Sara, and Jim. Rudy and Sara flee, but Jim stays to fend off Myers only to have his head crushed. Michael kills Rudy by pinning him to the door with kitchen knives before chasing Sara upstairs.

Locking herself in a bedroom, Sara begs for Deckard to help her. The other party goers realize that the deaths have not been staged. With Deckard messaging her Myers' location, Sara escapes and is found by Freddie. Myers finds and attacks them. Freddie is injured and Sara makes her way to the tunnels. She finds an exit near Donna's body and emerges in the garage, where Myers finds her and starts an electrical fire in the garage. Freddie returns and begins fighting Michael hand-to-hand. When he is overpowered, Freddie instead electrocutes Myers, tangling him up in electrical wiring before carrying Sara out of the burning garage.<ref name="H8">{{cite video|people= Rosenthal, Rick (Director), Larry Brand, and Sean Hood (Writers)|title=Halloween: Resurrection|medium=[[DVD]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Dimension Films]]|date=2002}}</ref> The Myers house burns to the ground, as Sara thanks Deckard for saving her life. 

Michael's body and the bodies of his victims are then taken to the morgue. As the medical examiner begins to examine Michael's body, he awakens.

==Production==
Despite popular belief, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' was not meant to be a final installment in the series. The writers of H20 were left with a dilemma when Jamie Lee Curtis wanted to end the series, but Moustapha Akkad had a clause that legally wouldn’t allow the writers to kill Michael off. According to the Blu-Ray released by Scream Factory, Jamie Lee Curtis almost left the project just weeks before filming, until Kevin Williamson came up with the paramedic storyline and presented it to Akkad. Curtis finally agreed to be a part of the film under the condition that no footage hinting toward a sequel would be presented by the film, and that the audience would believe that Michael was dead until the inevitable sequel was announced. Resurrection’s first shot of Michael in the paramedic uniform was filmed the day after H20’s principal photography ended, according to H20’s editor, Patrick Lussier.
The film's working title was ''Halloween: The Homecoming'', but its producers wanted a title that said Michael Myers is alive, so in February 2002, the film was officially renamed ''Halloween: Resurrection''. Also, the release date for the film was originally set as September 21, 2001, but producers at [[Dimension Films]] wanted the film to be stronger so re-shoots took place from September to October 2001. The release date was thus changed to April 19, 2002, then again to July 19 and moved one week earlier.

Both Whitney Ransick and [[Dwight H. Little]] were approached to direct the film but turned it down. Later [[Rick Rosenthal]], the director of ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'', was chosen to direct. During the casting period of the film, producers considered [[Danielle Harris]] (who played [[Jamie Lloyd]] in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'') for a role in the film. In post production [[Bianca Kajlich]]'s screams had to be [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] because of her inability to scream. The film's trailer was delivered on April 26, 2002, with the release of ''[[Jason X]]''. Principal photography began in Vancouver, British Columbia in 2001 with the opening scene filmed at Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, BC.<ref name="halloweenmovies">''Halloween: Resurrection'' Behind The Scenes at [http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h8bts.htm HalloweenMovies.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124225756/http://www.halloweenmovies.com/filmarchive/h8bts.htm |date=2013-01-24 }}.</ref>

Halloween: Resurrection's delayed production and reshoots meant at least two alternative versions exist. The first workprint, titled onscreen as ''Halloween: The Homecoming'', contained differences, some of which appeared on the DVD release including an alternative opening, multiple alternative endings, deleted scenes and an alternative score. Screencaps from a second workprint featuring deleted and alternative footage have been posted online, but copies are rare. This workprint is rumored to include the following deleted scenes, some of which are viewable on the retail DVD and [[YouTube]].

Jamie Lee Curtis was contractually obligated for a small cameo in the film, but reportedly agreed to film the full opening sequence on the condition that the writers put Laurie in an insane asylum and killed her character off as she no longer wanted to be a part of the franchise over dissatisfaction with the direction it was going. Curtis has since publicly announced her dissatisfaction with the film, believing the story should have ended with H20.

The film's original director was Whitney Ransick, who was let go right before filming started due to the studio wanting a more experienced director.

===Music===
For this eighth installment of the series, Danny Lux created a genuine score relying upon the original instead of generating something new. He approaches the score with an [[Electroacoustic music|electro-acoustic]] feel that dates back to the [[synthesizer]] scores of the '80s.<ref name="musicfromthemovies">''Halloween: Resurrection'' Music Review at [http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1621 Music from the Movies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029043128/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=1621 |date=2008-10-29 }}</ref> The film also features several rap and [[hip-hop]] songs.<ref name=newt/>

In direct contrast to general critical reviews of the film, some assessments of its sound and theme music have been praising. For example, critic Steve Newton complimented the film's "creepy" and "unsettling" revival of the original ''Halloween'' movie's theme while panning the film itself as well as the rap tracks included.<ref name=newt>{{cite web|url=http://earofnewt.com/2014/02/08/horror-review-halloween-resurrection/|accessdate=February 4, 2015|title=Horror Review: Halloween - Resurrection|date=February 8, 2014|first=Steve|last=Newton|publisher=[http://earofnewt.com/ earofnewt.com]}}</ref>

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Halloween: Resurrection'' was released on July 12, 2002 in the US to moderate reception which did not change in its later international release. The film peaked at #4 on its opening weekend on US screens raking in $12,292,121 behind ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'', ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' and ''[[Men in Black II]]''. It grossed $30,354,442 domestically and a further $7,310,413 for a moderate $37,664,855 worldwide gross.<ref name="boxofficemojo">''Halloween: '' at [http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=halloween8.htm Box Office Mojo]</ref>

===Critical response===
The film received highly unfavorable reviews from several critics. It has garnered a score of 12% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 59 reviews and a 13% among top critics based on 16 reviews, with the site's consensus being: "The only thing this tired slasher flick may resurrect is nostalgia for when the genre was still fresh and scary."<ref name=rotten/> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 19 out of 100, based on 17 reviews, indicating “overwhelming dislike”.<ref>{{Citation|title=Halloween: Resurrection|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/halloween-resurrection|accessdate=2018-02-12}}</ref>  Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, "It's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even {{'}}''[[Jason X]]''{{'}} look positively Shakespearian by comparison." Dave Kehr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen, not screaming but yawning."<ref name="newyorktimes">''Halloween: Resurrection'' Movie Review at [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9407E6D81130F930A25754C0A9649C8B63 New York Times]</ref> [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine said, "Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained. Consider this review life-affirming." Joe Leydon of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "[Seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels."  Glenn Lovell of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' was slightly more positive: "No, it's not as single-minded as John Carpenter's original, but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.<ref name="CinemaScore"> {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Potential sequel==
{{Unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
''Halloween: Resurrection'' concludes with the potential for another sequel to continue the story. Although there were plans for a new ''Halloween'' movie to continue after ''Resurrection'', no such film has yet been produced to continue the original series. [[Dimension Films]] would instead produce a [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] of the original ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' in 2007, which was directed by [[Rob Zombie]]. A [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] to Zombie's remake was released two years later on August 28, 2009. Talk of some kind of a follow up to ''Halloween: Resurrection'' specifically has come up over the years but nothing has yet come of it. In December 2015, it was announced that Dimension Films no longer had the rights to the Halloween franchise. It followed in May 2016 that [[Miramax]] and [[Blumhouse Productions]] were developing a [[Halloween (2018 film)|new ''Halloween'' film]] which they will co-finance. [[John Carpenter]] is set to produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help to try to make the 10th sequel the scariest of them all". On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new ''Halloween'' film would be released on October 19, 2018, and is going to be written by [[David Gordon Green]] and [[Danny McBride]] and will be directed by Green.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hipes|first=Patrick|url=http://deadline.com/2017/02/new-halloween-movie-david-gordon-green-danny-mcbride-1201907337/|title=Halloween & Down?
