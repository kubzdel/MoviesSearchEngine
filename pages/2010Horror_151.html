==Plot==

Director Kōji Shiraishi wants to film an episode for a [[Japan]]ese television program, featuring members of the [[Japanese idol|"Idol"]]-genre singing and dancing ensemble, Momoiro Clover Z (referred to in the film by their previous name, simply Momoiro Clover). The program is one wherein minor [[celebrity]] guests are employed to investigate [[haunted house]]s and similarly mysterious locales, in an attempt to determine the truth about such places, and their associated [[paranormal]] phenomena.  The members of Momoiro Clover are asked to visit an abandoned school, where a [[shrine]] to the minor [[deity]] (or [[demon]]?) known as "''Shirome''" is located.  This shrine takes the form of a painting that is thought to be of a [[butterfly]], but which may actually represent the being's face.

According to local legends, if ''Shirome'' is asked to grant a [[wish]], he will do so, but only if the person asking is completely sincere in both their request, and their belief in the existence and power of the ''Shirome'' entity.  If any wish is asked of this being in a frivolous manner, or in a spirit of unbelief, ''Shirome'' will destroy that person, either through causing them to have a fatal accident, inducing them to commit [[suicide]], or driving them hopelessly [[insanity|insane]].

The girls visit the shrine, and request of ''Shirome'' that they be granted a chance to appear on a nationwide Japanese television broadcast.  As soon as this wish is pronounced, a series of chaotic disturbances ensue, and a hulking, large, white-eyed being is briefly seen standing (or floating) next to the girls.  Subsequently, their entertainment career becomes characterized by a high degree of popularity and commercial success, but a disturbing video clip taken from immediately after one of their high-profile concerts suggests that their success may have been obtained in an ill-advised manner, and that the young ladies face the possibility of very fearsome, dire consequences in the future, perhaps including the loss of their [[soul]]s.
