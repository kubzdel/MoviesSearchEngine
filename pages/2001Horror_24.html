==Critical reception==
''Curse of the Talisman'' received mixed reviews generally unfavorable from critics. ''Clayton Trapp'' of ''Brilliant Observations on 1173 Films'' gave "Curse of the Talisman" one stars (out of two) and said, "Film gets on a formulaic track early and refuses to get off, which partly works for it. It's the least scary monster movie I've ever seen but it's satisfied to be there, they just want to stay on formula and entertain us the way that others have entertained them. No pretensions (no one is sitting around reading Nietzsche), no special effects addiction (but funny where used), no sex and gore over-the-topness (the gargoyles are actually kind of cute), no bullshit (or all bullshit, according to taste)." ''Video Picks for Perverts'' simply said, "There's no tits, either. Fucking worthless."
