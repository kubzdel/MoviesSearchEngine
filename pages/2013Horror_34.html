==Synopsis==
Janek (Gerhard Liebmann) is a technician who works at a research station in the [[Austrian Alps]]. Small teams of scientists come to the station to study [[global warming]]. It seems that Janek does not get along well with the current team, as he prefers to keep to himself. One day Janek and the scientists discover a glacier covered in a strange red liquid that has odd effects on the surrounding wildlife. The scientists become excited as they realize that the liquid is transforming the local wildlife into strange new genetic hybrids, but Janek is more wary of the liquid and the potential dangers it poses. His caution is soon proven to be warranted, as the group begins to fall prey to the hybrids created by the liquid. A supervisory visit by the climate minister is scheduled, and Janek is horrified when he finds that a former girlfriend of his is among the newcomers.
