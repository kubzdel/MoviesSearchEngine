'''''Evilenko''''' is a 2004 [[English language|English-language]] [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[Horror film|horror]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film very loosely based on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[serial killer]] [[Andrei Chikatilo]]. Written and directed by [[David Grieco]], the film stars [[Malcolm McDowell]], [[Marton Csokas]], and [[Ronald Pickup]].

==Plot==
In 1984, in [[Kiev]], schoolteacher Andrej Romanovich Evilenko is dismissed from his position after attempting to [[Child molestation|molest]] a student. Driven by his [[Psychopathy|psychopathic]] urges and embittered by the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Evilenko begins to [[rape]], kill, and [[cannibalism|cannibalize]] women and children. It is hinted throughout the movie that Evilenko somehow gained the power to psychically influence his victims, which accounts for their lack of resistance and his continuous evasion of the authorities.

Vadim Timurouvic Lesiev, a [[magistrate]] and family man, is assigned to catch the serial killer. For years, Evilenko eludes Lesiev and psychiatrist Aron Richter, who is assigned to [[offender profiling|profile]] the killer. Richter eventually finds Evilenko with a little girl and manages to break Evilenko's hypnotic hold on her, but is killed by Evilenko in retaliation; although it appears to Evilenko that she is run over by a train, the girl escapes alive.

Almost eight years later, Lesiev finally captures Evilenko, who by now has killed 55 people, mostly children and young women. On 22 May 1992, Evilenko goes to court, and on 14 February 1994, he is finally executed. Before his execution, several governments expressed interest in Evilenko's psychic abilities and asked for extradition of Evilenko but were denied.
