A group of young friends take a trip into [[Jotunheimen National Park]]. They plan on hiking into the area where an abandoned hotel sits in the mountains; it was the site of several disappearances including a young boy who vanished into thin air. After opting to camp in the woods instead of staying at the old hotel, the friends soon discover there is a hulking killer amongst the woods, and he may not be alone. [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] show the killer's childhood and youth in the 80s.<ref>[http://ung1881.biip.no/2750752 «Fritt Vilt 3» tilbake til starten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511000319/http://ung1881.biip.no/2750752 |date=11 May 2010 }}</ref>
