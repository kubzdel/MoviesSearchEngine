== Production ==
Director George Bonilla was inspired to make a zombie film after moving to Kentucky and finding a supportive [[independent film]] community there.  Bonilla believed that zombies created from a defective drug would allow for a wide variety of effects on people, and allowed him to write in both feral and intelligent zombies.  The cast and crew were mainly made up of people with no experience in filmmaking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/912/|title=George Bonilla: The Late, Great "Zombie Planet" Earth, Part 1|last=Watt|first=Mike|work=[[Film Threat]]|date=2005-01-19|accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>  Scenes were shot at the Bluegrass Aspendale housing project in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].
