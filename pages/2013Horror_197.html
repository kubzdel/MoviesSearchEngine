==Synopsis==
When a group of thrill-seeking young adults [[BASE jumping|BASE jump]] into a forbidden portion of the [[Tasmania]]n wilderness, they didn't foresee that one of their group would die in the process. They also didn't expect for their friend's blood to awaken ancient and gigantic [[Tasmanian devil]]s that would swiftly seek to make them their supper. The group finds some assistance in two park rangers that arrive to arrest the group for trespassing, only to find that they too are in danger of becoming the deadly beasts' prey. One by one people start to die. Whitford is killed by one of the monsters. Then Danz dies next. The rest of the group tries to plan out an idea. In the last part of the movie, Alex reveals that her younger brother died falling from a high tree and that's why she is afraid of heights. In the end, Jayne and Alex share and kiss and survive.
