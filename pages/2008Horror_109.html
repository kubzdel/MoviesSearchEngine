They finally reached the forest's entrance, only to find the passage blocked which induced them to continue their journey in by climbing the hilly road into the deep forest. 

After they settled down to camping at the night, Samantha was urged by the SAR Komodo crews on telling them her reason to enter the forest. Samantha retorted that they should abandoned their search and rescue mission in order to avoid danger that shall befall them should they persist. Moments later, they suddenly hear strange noises and experienced supernatural phenomena which influenced them to venture further into the forest area. During this excursion, Samantha managed to find a red shawl belonging to Stella. Samantha recalls the previous encounter with her mother, Mega N. Widjoko (Ida Iasha) who asked Samantha to got to the place called Ujung Sedo that located at the fringe of the deep forest in order to eliminate her wangsit over the Kuntilanak.

The next morning, as they started off the journey, a thick mist appeared out of nowhere and caused disturbance to their orientation tools as well as communication devices along with confusion over time and direction. Braving through the mist, Samantha and the others later followed Yenny (Cindy Valerie), the daughter of Sam's landlord who was kidnapped by the Kuntilanak in the second film. They trailed her until she disappear at the opening of a cave. Going without direction into the cave, they split into two group with each of them faced terrorizing event and strange encounter that cannot be explained via logical thinking or scientific evidence. In the climax of the event, they managed to exit the cave with a warning: Samantha need to go to the house of Mbah Putri, the origin place for the Kuntilanak's wangsit in Mangkoedjiwo family.

As they set up to camp at the clearing, Samantha explained her reason of coming here and ominously proclaimed that they have arrived at "Ujung Sedo". While everyone was sleeping, Herman who stood outside as the lookout is being haunted by the Kuntilanak which caused him to fell into a quicksand. The remaining four then search for Herman in the morning and stumbled upon a 'ghost' village devoid of residents. Countless bones, suspicious meats and a corpse littered the village. Going further into the village, the group found a carcass of a cow with its entrails cut open where inside it, emerged a crying sound of a baby. Although warned by others not to take the strange baby, Petra took the child. During the night, suddenly the baby went missing and when Petra goes out to search for the child, she was attacked by the Kuntilanak. Afterward Asti, Darwin, and Samantha ventured out to look for Petra where Samantha came across Yenny and followed her to a field with fallen leaves in the middle of the forest, and saw a group of blinded children running after a white horse.

Chasing after them, Samantha managed to find Yenny and while hiding, witness first hand the Kuntilanak's deed of collecting kidnapped children to suck off their souls as sustenance. A while later as Yenny and Samantha fled the scene, Darwin who saw the Kuntilanak was enchanted by the latter into committing suicide. In route to Mbah Putri's house, Samantha meets Asti who promised to survived together come next morning. Henceforth, Yenny and Samantha arrived at the dwelling-place of Mbah Putri. Confronting Samantha, Mbah Putri revealed the origin story of the Kuntilanak who came from the place. Samantha was told that the Kuntilanak was the vengeful spirit of a mother who was killed after giving birth to the child of devil whose fate was similar to the former. Except that Mbah Putri who at this time already century old of age, has agreed to carry the child in her womb as part of the condition of the pact to prolong her life into seemingly attaining immortality.

The Durmo (or the Chant) sang by Samantha and all the descendants of Mangkoedjiwo, were in fact composed by Mbah Putri in order to summon the Kuntilanak who then killed its victims and suck off their souls. The Kuntilanak was used as the conduit to replenished the strength of the devil's spawn using the souls of the murdered victims, to enable it to stay alive in Mbah Putri's womb thus making Mbah Putri immortal. Samantha's intention to go there to eliminate the wangsit cannot be done as long as the devil's child still live. It is revealed that Sam's encounter with Mega was an illusion created by Mbah Putri to lure Samantha to come to Ujung Sedo and becoming the replacement for the old crone as the host for the devil's child. Afterwards, Mbah Putri sing the 'durmo' and released the devil's child who crawled into Sam's womb. Later on, Samantha told Yenny to go to the rescue point, and then she climb atop the waterfall and jump off so that the devil's child will dies together with her and cease to exist from this world.

Yenny and her fellow captives together with Asti went to the rescue point and the rescuing helicopter descent down unto them, and they were all managed to be saved.
