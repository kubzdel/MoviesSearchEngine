==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->
On August 18, 1973, five young adults – Erin, her boyfriend Kemper, and their friends Morgan, Andy and Pepper – are on their way to a [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] concert after traveling to [[Mexico]] to purchase [[marijuana]]. While driving through [[Texas, Iowa]], the group picks up a distraught hitchhiker they see walking in the middle of the road. After they try to interact with the hitchhiker, who speaks incoherently about "[[Leatherface|a bad man]]", she shoots herself in the mouth.

The group goes to a nearby diner to contact the police, where a woman named Luda Mae tells them to meet [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Sheriff Hoyt/Charlie Hewitt|Sheriff Hoyt]] at the mill. Instead, they find a young boy named [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Jedidiah Hewitt|Jedidiah]], who tells them Hoyt is at home, [[binge drinking|getting drunk]]. Erin and Kemper go through the woods to find his house, leaving Morgan, Andy, and Pepper at the mill with Jedidiah. They come across a plantation house, and Erin is allowed inside by an amputee named [[List of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre characters#Old Monty Hewitt|Monty]] to call for help. Kemper goes inside to look for Erin, and is killed with a sledgehammer by Thomas Hewitt, also known as "[[Leatherface]]", who drags his body into the basement to make a new mask.

Meanwhile, Hoyt arrives at the mill, and disposes of the hitchhiker's body. After Erin discovers that Kemper is missing, she and Andy go back to Monty's house, and Erin distracts him, while Andy searches for Kemper. When Monty realizes that Andy is inside, he summons Leatherface, who attacks him with a chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface severs Andy's leg, and carries him to the basement, where he is impaled on a meat hook. Erin makes it back to the mill, but before she and the others can leave, Hoyt shows up. After finding marijuana on the dashboard, he orders Erin and Pepper to get out of the van, gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker, and tells him to reenact how she killed herself. Morgan, disturbed by his demands, attempts to shoot him, but the gun is unloaded. Hoyt then handcuffs Morgan and drives him back to the Hewitt house, taking the van's key with him.

Erin and Pepper are tracked down by Leatherface, who is wearing Kemper's face as a mask, and when Pepper attempts to run, she is killed by Leatherface. Erin runs and hides in a nearby trailer, belonging to an obese middle-aged woman known only as the Tea Lady, and a younger woman named Henrietta, who give her drugged tea. Erin discovers that they have kidnapped the hitchhiker's baby, but passes out before she can escape. Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house, surrounded by the entire family: Leatherface, his mother Luda Mae, Hoyt, Monty, and Jedidiah. Luda Mae explains to Erin that Leatherface was tormented his whole life, because of a skin disease that left his face disfigured, and she felt that no one cared for her family besides themselves.

Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy, and kills him to end his suffering after failing to get him off the hook. Afterwards, she finds Morgan handcuffed in a bathtub. Jedidiah, who does not agree with his family's actions, leads them out of the house, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned shack in the woods, and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, who hangs him from a chandelier by his handcuffs, and cuts through his groin with the chainsaw. Erin escapes into the woods with Leatherface in tow. She finds a slaughterhouse and attacks Leatherface with a meat cleaver, severing his right arm.

Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to drive away from the Hewitt house, but he stops to find help at the eatery. As the family is distracted by the trucker, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery, and places her in the sheriff's car. Erin hot-wires the car and Hoyt tries to stop her, but she runs him over repeatedly until he is dead. Leatherface suddenly appears in the road and slashes the car with his chainsaw, but Erin manages to escape with the baby, and he watches in frustration as she drives away. Two days later, two investigating officers are killed by Leatherface while doing a crime scene investigation of the Hewitt residence, and a narrator states that the case still remains open.

==Production==

===Development===
On December 5, 2001, Creature Corner.com reported that [[Michael Bay]]'s newly created company [[Platinum Dunes]] (which was created in order to produce low budget films), had set its focus on remaking ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''. Early announcements on the site indicated that the story would be told in flashback with actress [[Marilyn Burns]] who starred in the original film would reprise her role as an aged [[Sally Hardesty]] recounting the events in the film. It was later announced that the filmmakers had already purchased the rights to the original film. Early in the film's production the original films makers [[Tobe Hooper]] and [[Kim Henkel]] would be writing a script for the film, but it was unknown at the time whether or not that their script would be used. In June 2002, it was announced that  [[Marcus Nispel]] would direct the film in his directorial debut.<ref name="Mania.com">{{cite web|title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The - Mania.com|url=http://www.mania.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre_article_35579.html?action=add_comment|website=Mania.com|publisher=Mania.com|accessdate=21 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114822/http://www.mania.com/texas-chainsaw-massacre_article_35579.html?action=add_comment|archivedate=August 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Nispel said that he was initially against the idea of remaking the film, calling it "blasphemy" to his longtime director of photography, [[Daniel Pearl (cinematographer)|Daniel Pearl]], who had shot the original film.  Pearl, however, encouraged Nispel to join the project, as he wanted to bookend his career with ''Chainsaw'' films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/features/interviews/11861-marcus-nispel-the-asylum-texas-chainsaw-massacre-friday-the-13th|title=Marcus Nispel {{!}} THE ASYLUM, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, FRIDAY THE 13TH|last=Pollard|first=Andrew|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>

It was later announced that [[Scott Kosar]] signed on as the film's screenwriter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/markets-festivals/horror-redo-chainsaw-catches-biel-balfour-1117868720/|title=Horror redo ‘Chainsaw’ catches Biel, Balfour|last=Harris|first=Dana|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=18 June 2002|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>
As in the original 1974 version, it is loosely inspired by the real life crimes of Wisconsin serial killer [[Ed Gein]]. Gein's crimes had also inspired books such as ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[Silence of the Lambs (novel)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', both of which were later adapted into subsequent films.<ref>{{cite web | author=Rachael Bell and Marilyn Bardsley | title=Ed Gein: The Inspiration for Buffalo Bill and Psycho | work=[[truTV]] | url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/bill_1.html | accessdate=August 3, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209052429/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/gein/bill_1.html | archivedate=February 9, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Writing===
The screenplay was written by Scott Kosar, who went on to write the screenplays for ''[[The Machinist]]''<ref>Holden, Stephen. "[https://movies.nytimes.com/2004/10/22/movies/22mach.html?_r=1 Insomnia and Then Emaciation; Now Paranoia Takes Its Turn.]" The New York Times 22 October 2004.</ref> and Platinum Dunes [[The Amityville Horror (2005 film)|remake of ''The Amityville Horror'']].<ref name="kosarinterview">{{cite web|last1=Condit|first1=Jon|title=Kosar, Scott (The Amityville Horror) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/3309/kosar-scott-the-amityville-horror/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=Jon Condit|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref>
The film was Kosar's first professional job as a screenwriter, with the writer later recalled feeling both thrilled and honored at the prospect of writing the screenplay for the remake. Kosar also realized early on that he was dealing with "one of the seminal works of the genre" and one that could not be bettered. When discussing with the film's producers, Kosar felt that the new film shouldn't try to compete with the original film, as he felt that it was made under different circumstances.
In earlier drafts Erin, the film's main character, was revealed to be nine months pregnant throughout the film but was removed from later drafts at producer Michael Bay's insistence.<ref name="nispelinterview">{{cite web|title=Mr. Beaks Interviews Marcus Nispel, TEXAS CHAINSAW Remake Director!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/16298|website=Ain't It Cool.com|publisher=Ain't It Cool News Staff|accessdate=11 August 2016}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Jessica Biel]], who previously starred in the television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', was revealed to cast as the main character Erin.<ref name="Mania.com"/>

Actor [[Andrew Bryniarski]], who starred in Bay's ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and stayed friends with him afterwards, personally met with producer Bay and asked him for the role of Leatherface. Another actor was cast for the role before Bryniarski, but, on the first day, the actor was hospitalized and fired for lying about his physical abilities. Without an actor for the film's main antagonist, the filmmakers called and asked if Bryniarski still wanted the role, which he accepted. To prepare for the role, Bryniarski ate a diet of brisket and white bread in order to get his weight to nearly 300 pounds. Bryniarski would later reprise his role as Leatherface in the film's [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning|prequel]].<ref name="Interview with Andrew Bryniarski">{{cite web|title=Interview with Andrew Bryniarski|url=http://www.texaschainsawmassacre.net/Interviews/ABryniarski/interview.htm|website=texaschainsawmassacre.net|publisher=texaschainsawmassacre.net|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}</ref>

===Filming===
Nispel favored shooting the film in [[California]], but Bay suggested [[Texas]], where he had previously shot three films.<ref name=ign-bay>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/16/an-interview-with-michael-bay?page=3|title=An Interview with Michael Bay|last=Head|first=Steve|work=[[IGN]]|date=14 October 2003|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> [[Principal photography]] began in [[Austin]] in July 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/news/nispel-to-direct-remake-of-chainsaw-massacre-1117866593/|title=Nispel to direct remake of ‘Chainsaw Massacre’|last=Harris|first=Dana|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=7 May 2002|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref> and lasted 40 days.<ref name=ign-bay/> The original film was shot in a style more reminiscent of a documentary.  Nispel intentionally shot in a different style, using more traditionally narrative elements, as he did not want to make a shot-for-shot remake, as in [[Gus van Sant]]'s ''Psycho'' remake.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/25/an-interview-with-marcus-nispel?page=2|title=An Interview with Marcus Nispel|last=Patrizio|first=Andy|work=[[IGN]]|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=24 February 2016}}</ref>  The remake includes references to the previous film, including [[John Larroquette]], who returns in his role as the film's narrator.<ref>{{cite book|title=Style and Form in the Hollywood Slasher Film|last=Elliott-Smith|first=Darren|editor-last=Clayton|editor-first=Wickham|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2016|isbn=9781137496478|page=181|chapter=Queer Erotic Aesthetics in ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre''|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWPeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA181}}</ref>

The weather during filming was very hot and humid. Bryniarski, who portrays Leatherface in the film, did all his own stunts and was forced to wear a "fat suit", which increased his near-300 lbs to 420 lbs. The suit also heated up quickly so that the actor had to ensure that he drank a lot of fluids before a shoot. Leatherface's mask was also a problem; the mask was made out of [[Silicone]] and was difficult for the actor to breathe through. The crew had many prop chainsaws for actor Bryniarski to use, such as chainsaws that put out smoke, and live chainsaws.<ref name="Interview with Andrew Bryniarski"/>

But all the bad-rehash mojo from ''Friday the 13th'' to ''The Blair Witch Project'' has infected Scott Kosar's script. Hooper went for primitive, Nispel goes for slick.
