== Plot ==

A zombie horde overtakes the [[Mall of America]]. Meanwhile, we see a man named Tom feverishly barricading the inside of his house, only to have his not-too-bright girlfriend open a window to let some fresh air in.

The ghouls enter and overtake the couple, but only after a valiant attempt by Tom to decimate the invaders with his .357 magnum. During the struggle, Tom's last bullet accidentally discharges into Barbara's femoral artery. Barbara bleeds to death in the hallway as Tom is devoured.

The next day, Barbara stumbles through downtown St. Paul as a newly activated zombie. She encounters Jesus Christ on a street corner and bites a huge bloody chunk out of his forearm. Barbara continues on, walking aimlessly through the empty city; she eventually collapses on the sidewalk. Barbara's appearance changes back to normal as she returns to life.
