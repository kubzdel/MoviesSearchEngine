'''''Blade: Trinity''''' (also known as '''''Blade III''''' or '''''Blade III: Trinity''''') is a 2004 American [[superhero film]] written, produced and directed by [[David S. Goyer]], who also wrote the screenplays to ''[[Blade (film)|Blade]]'' and ''[[Blade II]]''.  It stars [[Wesley Snipes]], who also produced, in the title role based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] alongside [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Jessica Biel]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Dominic Purcell]], [[Parker Posey]] and [[Triple H]].

It is the third and final film in the [[Blade (film series)|''Blade'' film series]]. The film grossed $128 million at the box office worldwide on a budget of $65 million.  On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''Blade: Trinity'' has a 25% approval rating and a critical consensus that it "seems content to emphasize style over substance and rehash familiar themes".  It was followed by 2006's ''[[Blade: The Series]]''. The film also marks Reynolds' first superhero role as well as first collaboration with Marvel Entertainment.  This film would be the final release in the series as Marvel regained the film rights to the character in 2011.

==Plot==
Vampires investigate an ancient tomb in the [[Syrian Desert]], which they believe belongs to Dracula, the first vampire. To keep Blade from interfering, they frame him for the murder of a human [[Familiar spirit|familiar]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents subsequently locate Blade's hideout and kill his mentor and friend, [[Abraham Whistler]]. Demoralized, Blade surrenders and is arrested.

The vampires' familiars have arranged for the authorities to turn Blade over to them. He is rescued by [[Hannibal King]] and Abigail Whistler, Abraham's daughter, who invite Blade to join their band of vampire hunters, the [[Nightstalkers (comics)|Nightstalkers]]. From them, Blade learns that Danica Talos, an old enemy of King's, has revived Dracula, or "Drake", with the goal of using his powers to cure vampires of their weaknesses. As the first of the vampires, Drake's DNA is untainted and he is able to survive in sunlight.  Along with newly-innovative [[ultraviolet]] "[[Sun dog]]" [[ammunition]], the Nightstalkers have created an experimental [[bioweapon]] known as Daystar, capable of killing vampires at the genetic level. However, they need a purer blood source to make it effective. As Drake is too powerful to kill via normal means, they hope that the virus will kill him and, with his blood in the mix, ensure the rest of the species is wiped out, but also fear that this will include Blade, too.  

Eager to test Blade, Drake isolates him from the Nightstalkers, as he considers them unworthy of challenging him. He explains that all humans and vampires are inferior in his eyes and that he intends to wipe them from the Earth.  Abigail finds evidence of the vampires "Final solution": a network of 'farms' where comatose humans are drained of their blood for vampire consumption. Told the humans are all brain dead, Blade [[Euthanasia|deactivates]] the farm's life support systems.

Returning to the Nightstalkers's hideout, Abigail and Blade find all of them dead except for King and Sommerfield's daughter Zoe, both of whom have been taken captive. A recording left by Sommerfield, Daystar's creator, reveals that Drake's blood is all that is needed to make it complete and effective. King is tortured by the vampires for information, but refuses to talk, even when they threaten to turn him and feed him Zoe's blood.

Blade and Abigail arrive and free the captives. Drake eventually bests Blade in single combat and prepares to kill him with his own sword. Abigail fires the Daystar arrow, but Drake catches it before it strikes him. He drops it to the floor by Blade, not realising the danger it poses to him. At the last second, Blade stabs him with it, triggering a chemical reaction that completes the "Daystar" virus, releasing it into the air, the virus becomes airborne, killing Danica and the rest of the vampires. As Drake slowly succumbs to his wounds and the virus, he praises Blade for fighting honorably, but warns him that he will eventually succumb to his need for blood, thus proving that Blade already is the new type of vampire.

Using the last of his power, Drake disguises himself as Blade. The FBI recover the body and declare Blade legally dead (In the unrated cut, as the FBI tries to do an autopsy on "Blade", Drake springs back to life, killing several of the autopsy members before ominously looming over one of the orderlies). Hannibal narrates that the virus didn't kill Blade as the human half of his heart didn’t stop beating, it only slowed down, causing him to enter into a comatose state until his body was ready to fight again. Blade awakens several months later ready to continue his fight against the vampires.

==Production==

===Production troubles===
Reportedly, series star [[Wesley Snipes]] was unhappy with the film's script and original choice of director. [[David S. Goyer]], who had written all three films in the franchise, was then selected to replace the original director of the film, which Snipes protested. Snipes reportedly caused difficulty during filming, including frequently refusing to shoot scenes, often forcing director Goyer to use stand-ins and [[Computer generated imagery|computer effects]] to add his character to scenes. Co-star [[Patton Oswalt]] alleged that Snipes would spend much of his time smoking [[marijuana]] in his trailer, and that he had become violent with Goyer after falsely accusing him of racism. It has also been alleged that Snipes refused to interact with Goyer or his co-stars, and would instead communicate with them through his assistant or the use of notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/patton-oswalt-on-his-most-memorable-roles-and-givi-88860|title=Patton Oswalt on his most memorable roles and giving life advice to Dane Cook|publisher=}}</ref> Snipes also allegedly referred to co-star [[Ryan Reynolds]] as a "[[Cracker (pejorative)|cracker]]" on one or more occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/feature.php?feature=1451&printer=1|title=eFilmCritic - Drugs, Stand-Ins, Mood Swings and Legal Action: The Real Wesley Snipes|publisher=}}</ref>

[[Hannibal King]] is at one point seen watching the Esperanto language film ''[[Incubus (1965 film)|Incubus]]'' on television; one reviewer remarked
that first time director "Goyer's grasp of directorial fundamentals (such as when to tilt the camera and when to shoot in close-up) is about as strong as [[William Shatner|Shatner's]] fluency in Esperanto."<ref>{{cite web

===Lawsuit===
In 2005, Snipes sued [[New Line Cinema]] and Goyer, claiming that the studio did not pay his full salary, that he was intentionally cut out of casting decisions and filmmaking process, despite being one of the producers, and that his character's screen time was reduced in favor of costars [[Ryan Reynolds]] and [[Jessica Biel]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://variety.com/2005/biz/news/snipes-throwing-legal-blade-at-trinity-team-1117921445/|title=Snipes throwing legal blade at 'Trinity' team|last=Shprintz|first=Janet|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2005-04-20|accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>
