Yukie Mashiro ([[Yui Miura]]), having heard rumours about Kagenuma's extraordinary abilities, visits his home to beg for his help.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews.

Twitchfilm reviewer Ard Fijn gave it a positive review saying: "Shinya Tsukamoto has made a very impressive film with some strong statements about loss and grief, and has wrapped this in a fantasy horror mystery thriller. People expecting a regular entry from one of those four genres are in for either a rude awakening or a pleasant surprise. For me "Nightmare Detective 2" was a pleasant surprise, but many people I spoke with after the viewing were less enamored by the convoluted story."<ref>http://twitchfilm.com/reviews/2009/02/iffr-2009-nightmare-detective-2-review.php</ref>

Japancinema reviewed the film positively, stating: "Nightmare Detective 2 can actually be viewed as a stand alone film, however, watching the original first is always advisable. One big hurdle for viewers to overcome is the fact that this film is jam-packed with ambiguity from start to finish but I urge you not to be driven to frustration. The first film had a visceral brutality to it, as this one on the other hand, can be described as a slow ride into silent darkness.<ref name="Japcine">http://japancinema.net/2010/08/04/nightmare-detective-2-review/</ref>" and suggested that a third film would be welcolmed.<ref name="Japcine" />

Rowthree.com gave the film 4 out of a possible 5 and also commented that he would embrace a third movie, "I for one truly hope that Tsukamoto and Matsuda will return one final time and wrap the story up in a trilogy. I am sure we will be left with as many questions as answers when everything is done but with a character so compelling and Tsukamoto’s unique vision into dreams I for one welcome the challenge of revisiting the Nightmare Detective again.<ref>http://www.rowthree.com/2010/10/01/review-nightmare-detective-2/</ref>"
