==Plot==
In Tennessee, the Robertson County Sheriff’s Department releases a footage found on the cell phones and video cameras of the dead Sawyer family. What was first thought to be a murder-suicide is now believed to be the return of a centuries-old supernatural sinister force.

==Reception==
Rob Getz from Horrornews.net noted that "though utilizing the oddly tropical January climate in Tennessee... for a few pivotal witchy woodland shenanigans, much of the film takes place within the walls of the Sawyer home, owing a greater debt to the “[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]” franchise".<ref name="hn"/> Getz added that the film is "slapping elements of "[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]", "[[Darkness Falls (2003 film)|Darkness Falls]]" and countless others into the wildly uneven casserole" and that "watching this Amtrak jump the rails is never short of interesting".<ref name="hn"/>
