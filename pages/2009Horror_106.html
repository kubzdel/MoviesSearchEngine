The plot revolves around a group of Parisian policemen who embark on a mission of vengeance after one of their colleagues dies at the hands of a notorious drug dealer holed up inside a condemned high-rise in the heart of a derelict and corrupt Paris neighborhood(ZUP<ref>ZUP [[:fr:Zone à urbaniser en priorité]]</ref>). They storm the social housing complex with the intent of taking him down,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12837|title=Horror Film to Watch: 'The Horde'|publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com}}</ref> but the operation is a failure and the team is captured.
