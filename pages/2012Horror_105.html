==Critical reception==

In the year end wrap up, ''[[SF Weekly]]'' said of ''I Am a Ghost'', "Real horror...if every first effort in a genre is this good, we encourage his restlessness."<ref name="SFWeekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/bestof/2012/award/best-new-horror-director-3071301/|title=Best New Horror Director - 2012 |author=SF Weekly|date=2012-05-18}}</ref> while Tim Sika of the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle]] called it "Brilliant. Like Kubrick, Bergman, Hitchcock and Fincher combined."<ref name="KGO Radio">{{cite web|url=http://www.stationcaster.com/player_skinned.php?s=861&c=7551&f=2025283|title=Play Now |author=KGO Radio|date=2013-03-09}}</ref>

In a more mixed review, while Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it "Haunting. Cleverly conceived [and] artfully crafted" he makes note that the film is "a bit of a slog at times getting to the point at which the suspense kicks up a few notches."<ref name="Variety">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2012/scene/reviews/i-am-a-ghost-1117947243/|title=I Am a Ghost |author=Variety|date=2013-03-09}}</ref>
