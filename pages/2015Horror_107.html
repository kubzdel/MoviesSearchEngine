== Plot ==
Bob ([[Robert Chapin]]) is coming to terms with his unsuccessful attempts at becoming an actor when he is bitten by a vampire named Susan - the daughter of a crazed vigilante slayer. Consequently, Bob becomes one of the Hunted. The Hunted are a small group of humans, bitten but not turned, who use cold steel and fighting technique to fend off vampires. The vampires, however, have developed an immunity to everything over the years, and the only way they can be killed is with a [[sword]]. Luckily, Bob knows how to use a sword, mostly due to his starring role in a cheesy 80’s action flick called “Vampslayer”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/movies/hunted(2016).shtml|title=(re)Search my Trash|website=www.searchmytrash.com|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref>

=== Conception and writing ===
''The Hunted'' began in 2001 as a long-standing Internet series, created by Robert Chapin in an effort to train his credentials as a [[Stunt performer|stuntman]] and [[Visual effects|VFX]]-artist. Embracing his skills with a sword and his technical abilities behind the camera, he brought together friends and colleagues to combine their talents and undertake an underdog story of [[Los Angeles|LA]]-based vampire hunters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://60minuteswith.co.uk/film-and-tv/review-the-hunted/|title=Review: The Hunted - 60 Minutes With|date=2016-04-05|work=60 Minutes With|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US}}</ref> The fact that [[user-generated content]] created by fans becoming the main content source for the online series is reflected in the theme of the film, where soccer moms learn to become [[Vampire hunter|vampire slayers]], just like fans learning to become [[Filmmaking|filmmakers]].
