==Plot==
Prae and Pong are a young couple enjoying their lives and careers. Prae works as a graphic artist while her boyfriend, Pong, directs television commercials. One day, Prae collapses at work and it turns out she is pregnant. At first Prae is worried that Pong will not accept the baby, but he surprises her with a marriage proposal. The couple then settles into a home but the adjustment is difficult as Prae must quit her job and soon becomes bored while Pong works overtime to make up for the lost income.

Then the baby, Pan, is born. He cries constantly, adding to the tension felt by the new parents. A doctor says the baby simply has [[colic]], and that after about six months, things will settle down. However,  the crying continues. Prae, because she spends most of her time with baby, notices strange things happening and becomes convinced that sinister forces from victims of Pan (when he was a general in his last life) are making the baby unhappy. Ultimately Pan is safe.
