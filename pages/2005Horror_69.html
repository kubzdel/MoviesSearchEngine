==Plot==
Five thousand years ago, in [[Sumer]], the [[fallen angel]]s had intercourse with human females and their offspring were a race of giants called [[Nephilim]], destroyed by the great flood. The evil angel Ammon (Navid Negahban) mummifies his son Aramis to save him, and hides in hell. In the present days, the archaeologist Matt Fletcher (Casper Van Dien) finds Aramis tomb while excavating for building a resort for the entrepreneur Morton (Robert Wagner). The engineer Angela (Kristen Miller) joins the team, giving support in the diggings. When some workers mysteriously vanish, Morton hires the security force of Ammon to find the missing men. However, his real intention is to resurrect Aramis in the eclipse of the moon and dominate the human race with a new breed of giants. In the end, by creating a flood, they are able to drown both Aramis and Ammon, but not before Aramis reveals he has other children scattered at the four corners of the globe.
