'''''Xtinction: Predator X''''' (aka '''Alligator X''') is an American [[Horror film|Horror]][[Science fiction film|/Science Fiction]] film released August 18, 2010, directed by  [[Amir Valinia]]. The story revolves around a strange Louisiana swamp creature, which was a cloned  [[Pliosaurus]]. The creature was created by [[zoology|zoologist]] (and ex-husband of the protagonist, Laura Le Crois), Dr. Charles LeBlanc. The reptile is the return to life of a [[crocodile]] ancestor, the "[[Tyrannosaurus Rex]]” of the oceans, who was supposed to be extinct.

== Synopsis ==

Laura Le Crois is recently divorced and forced to return home after a hiatus of 20 years. Her father is deep in debt, her ex-boyfriend is the town sheriff, and her ex-husband, [[zoology|zoologist]] LeBlanc, has left his job as professor to buy a [[wetland]]. Laura began working in the family business in order to save the swamp and take advantage of her free time, riding in a boat through the swamps.

On her first tour, Laura and her passengers see two swamp rats squirming in a crocodile pit, deep in the swamp. However, in this pit, in place of a crocodile, was gigantic creature. She is then kidnapped by her ex-husband's minions (who knew she was researching the origins of the reptile). She learns that this creature was a pliosaurus cloned by her ex-husband, who called him the [[Predator X]]. The beast is about 50 feet long, has giant teeth, and moves rapidly through the water. Now, lost in the swamps of Louisiana, Laura must save her passengers.<ref name="abanpredx">[http://www.abandomoviez.net/db/pelicula.php?film=19422 Abandomoviez: Alligator X (Extinción: Predator X)]</ref>
