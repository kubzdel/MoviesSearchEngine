'''''Final Destination 3''''' is a 2006 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[James Wong (filmmaker)|James Wong]]; it is the third installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. Wong and [[Glen Morgan]], who worked on the franchise's [[Final Destination (film)|first film]], wrote the screenplay. ''Final Destination 3'' stars [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] and [[Ryan Merriman]], and takes place six years after the first film.{{#tag:ref|The film is set in 2005. Kevin's statement to Wendy outside their school that the Flight 180 explosion from the first film occurred "six years ago" is a continuity error, as the first film is set in 2000.|group="note"}} Winstead plays [[Wendy Christensen]], a teenager who has a [[precognition|premonition]] that a roller-coaster she and her classmates are riding will derail. Although she saves some of them, [[Death (personification)|Death]] begins hunting the survivors. Wendy realizes photographs she took at the [[amusement park]] contain clues about her classmates' death. She tries to use this knowledge to save the rest of them.

The film's development began shortly after the release of ''[[Final Destination 2]]'' (2003); [[Jeffrey Reddick]], creator of the franchise and a co-writer of the first two films, did not return for the third one. Unlike the second film, which was a sequel to the first, the producers envisioned ''Final Destination 3'' as a stand-alone film. The idea of featuring a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster came from [[New Line Cinema]] executive Richard Bryant. From the beginning, Wong and Morgan saw [[locus of control|control]] as a major theme in the film. Casting began in March 2005 and concluded in April. Like the previous two installments, it was filmed in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, Canada]]. The first two weeks of the three-month shoot were spent filming the roller-coaster's derailment.

Following its premiere at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] on February 2, 2006, the film was released in cinemas in the United States on February 10, 2006. The DVD, released on July 25, 2006, includes commentaries, documentaries, a deleted scene and an animated video. A special-edition DVD called "Thrill Ride Edition" includes a feature called "Choose Their Fate", which acts as an [[interactive film]], allowing viewers to make decisions at specific points in the film that alter the course of the story.

''Final Destination 3'' received a mixed critical response. Some critics called the film formulaic and said it brought nothing new to the franchise, while others praised it for being enjoyable and fulfilling its audience's expectations. The death scenes involving tanning beds and a nail gun, as well as Winstead’s performance attracted positive comments from reviewers. The film was a financial success and, with box office receipts of nearly $118 million, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The sequels ''[[The Final Destination]]'' (2009) and ''[[Final Destination 5]]'' (2011) followed it.

==Plot==
High-school student [[Wendy Christensen]] visits an amusement park for a senior-class field trip with her boyfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Jason|Jason Wise]], best friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Carrie|Carrie Dreyer]], and Carrie's boyfriend [[List of Final Destination characters#Kevin|Kevin Fischer]]. As they board the Devil's Flight roller-coaster, Wendy has a [[premonition]] that the hydraulics securing the seat belts and coaster cars will fail during the ride, killing everyone on board. She panics and a fight breaks out. Kevin, best friends [[List of Final Destination characters#Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin|Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin]]; alumnus [[List of Final Destination characters#Frankie|Frankie Cheeks]]; athlete [[List of Final Destination characters#Lewis|Lewis Romero]]; and [[goth subculture|goth]] couple [[List of Final Destination characters#Ian|Ian McKinley]] and [[List of Final Destination characters#Erin|Erin Ulmer]] get off the ride. The roller-coaster derails killing the remaining passengers leaving Wendy devastated.

Several weeks later Kevin tells Wendy about an [[Final Destination (film)|aircraft explosion]] and the subsequent deaths of the survivors, believing they might be in a similar situation. Thinking Kevin is mocking her, Wendy dismisses his theory. Then Ashley and Ashlyn die in a sandstorm. Now convinced [[Death (personification)|Death]] is stalking them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using [[omen]]s hidden in photographs Wendy took on the night of the roller-coaster derailment.

Frankie dies in a bike accident at a [[drive-through]]. The next day, they try to save Lewis at the gym. He says he does not believe them shortly before two he is runover by a gymtruck. They find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store. Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling knifes. Erin falls on a [[ gun]] and is shot repeatedly through the head. Wendy and Kevin are questioned by police then released. Assuming whoever was next must already be dead, they decide to ensure their own safety. As she leaves the station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.

Wendy learns that her sister [[List of Final Destination characters#Julie Christensen|Julie]] and a friend also escaped the roller-coaster crash. She and Kevin rush to save them. They prevent Julie from being impaled on a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]]. Julie's friend [[List of Final Destination characters#Perry|Perry Malinowski]] is impaled on a flagpole. Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister. A deranged Ian, who blames her for Erin's death, confronts her. Wendy dodges exploding fireworks he throws at her. They strike a nearby [[house]] that collapses and kills Ian.

Five months later, Wendy experiences more omens riding on a subway with her roommate Laura and friend Sean. As Wendy is about to disembark, she sees Julie entering the sub and decides to stay. She later notices Kevin sitting at the back of the car. As the two of them are talking, the train derails and everyone on board except Wendy is killed. Soon after, Wendy is hit by another train. It turns out this is another premonition and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie try to stop the train. The film ends with the screen going black and loud metal screeching being heard shortly before the credits roll.

}}

Three critical theories about the ''Final Destination'' franchise have been discussed in scholarly works. It has been framed as a [[postmodern film|postmodern]] horror franchise that, like the [[Scream (franchise)|''Scream'' franchise]], self-consciously refers to the history of horror cinema and rewards viewers for their knowledge. Second, the films—particularly ''[[The Final Destination]]'' (2009) and ''[[Final Destination 5]]'' (2011)—have been examined for their visual effects.<!--This is not a theory---> Third, the franchise has been criticized for being cynical and reductive.<ref name="B300"/> For example, film studies scholar Reynold Humphries dismisses the franchise as "obscurantist nonsense whose only 'idea' is that death is an agency that has a 'plan' for each of us".<ref>[[#Humphries|Humphries (2002)]], p. 191</ref><!-- This is criticism, not a theory--->

According to [[media studies]] scholar Eugenie Brinkema, ''Final Destination'' films are characterized by their move away from the typical horror [[antagonist]] and toward the certainty and inevitability of death.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]], p. 298</ref> This makes them inconsistent with most other horror films, which require a monster. ''Final Destination'' films depart further from other horror films, even those aimed at teenagers, in that a family narrative is lacking, and there are no hauntings of any kind. As well, there is no sexuality—"neither the pursuit of pleasure in the slasher convention of easy bodily access nor the monstrosity of sexual difference".<ref name="B300"/> Brinkema argues the films are not about seeking pleasure like typical [[slasher film|slasher]] films. Instead they are about the avoidance of pain and death; they are fundamentally "bitter ... paranoid, and sad" and display the inability of characters to feel pleasure.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]], p. 301</ref> In these films, death becomes its own cause. The premonition of the roller-coaster derailment in ''Final Destination 3'' is without context or cause. The avoidance of death by some characters grounds the necessity of their deaths, specifically the order in which they would have died on the roller-coaster.<ref>[[Final Destination 3#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  pp. 299–300, 303</ref> Thus, "Death's list" or "Death's design" is realized.<ref name="B300">[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]], p. 300</ref> ''Final Destination 3'' spends as much time interpreting deaths as displaying them. Wendy's close analysis of photographs allows her to understand the deaths, but this is inevitably too late to save her friends.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  p. 305</ref> In the franchise's films, Brinkema says, "one must closely read to survive (for a spell), and yet reading changes absolutely nothing at all".<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  p. 306</ref> Thus, the characters "might as well" have stayed on the roller-coaster.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  p. 307</ref>

Ian Conrich, a film studies scholar, argues the series marks a key departure from slasher norms in that death itself becomes the villain. ''Final Destination'' films draw influences from slasher cinema but the franchise's action sequences, including ''Final Destination 3''{{'s}} roller-coaster derailment, draw from [[action film|action]] and [[disaster film|disaster]] cinema.<ref name="C114">[[#Conrich|Conrich (2015)]], p. 114</ref> For Conrich, the franchise marks a new slasher-film sub-genre. Because the deaths are extremely violent and excessive, any number can happen at once, and all of them are inevitable, he calls the films "grand slashers".<ref name="C114"/> Other grand slashers include the films in the [[Saw (franchise)|''Saw'']] and ''[[Cube (film series)|Cube]]'' franchises.<ref name="C114"/>

A notable feature of the ''Final Destination'' films is the threshold or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]], p. 299</ref> Conrich frames the complex death sequences in ''Final Destination'' films as "death games, contraptions or puzzles in which there are only losers". He compares the sequences to [[Rube Goldberg machines]], the [[Grand Guignol]], and the ''[[Mouse Trap (game)|Mouse Trap]]'' board game.<ref name="C115">[[#Conrich|Conrich (2015)]], p. 115</ref> Brinkema selects the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from ''Final Destination 3'' as epitomizing the series' death sequences. The characters' deaths are brought about by "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen doorstop. The scene uses logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the characters' deaths, and to allow Wendy to recognize the threat they face.<ref name="Brinkema 303–4">[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  pp. 303–4</ref> An example of the "literal tipping point" at which the characters can no longer escape occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an air-conditioning unit that is activated by the increasing heat.<ref>[[#Brinkema|Brinkema (2015)]],  p. 304</ref> Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as an example of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from the frightening aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the "theatrics and kinetics" of the former.<ref name="C115"/>

The idea of using a roller-coaster derailment as the opening-scene disaster came from [[New Line Cinema]] executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by the [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad#Incidents|Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident]] from 2003 when a derailment occurred that crushed a rider.

During the casting process, Wong sought actors who could portray the main characters as heroic individuals with realistic qualities. Perry echoed this sentiment, saying that for the Wendy and Kevin characters they looked for actors who "had the charisma of movie stars, but weren't so ridiculously rarefied that you couldn't feel like you might know them".<ref name = "Scriptologist"/> They took great care casting the supporting characters who were considered as important to the film as the main characters.<ref name = "Scriptologist">{{cite web|last1=Bossik |first1=Glenn |title=The Screenplay For Final Destination 3 |url=http://www.scriptologist.com/Magazine/News/Final/final.html |website=''Scriptologist'' |accessdate=June 19, 2017 |date=March 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619124638/http://www.scriptologist.com/Magazine/News/Final/final.html |archivedate=June 19, 2017 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Like the first two installments of the franchise, ''Final Destination 3'' was filmed in [[Vancouver]], Canada.<ref name = "Final Destination 3 - Dread Central"/><ref name = "Mary interview"/> The [[Corkscrew (Playland)|Corkscrew]] roller-coaster at [[Playland (Vancouver)|Vancouver's Playland]] was the Devil's Flight coaster depicted in the film.<ref name = "Mary interview"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ward |first1=Anna |title=Most Popular Film Locations In Vancouver |url=http://604now.com/2014/08/27/most-popular-film-locations-in-vancouver/ |website=''604 Now'' |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |date=August 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207113725/http://604now.com/2014/08/27/most-popular-film-locations-in-vancouver/ |archivedate=February 7, 2017 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Winstead and Merriman said the filming took three months with the first two weeks were spent shooting the roller-coaster's derailment.

[[File:Corkscrew_(Playland).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Corkscrew (Playland)|Corkscrew]] roller-coaster was used as the Devil's Flight in the film. [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and a variety of camera angles made it look larger.|alt=Photograph of a red roller-coaster performing a loop.]]

The death scenes required varying degrees of 2D and 3D graphic enhancement. The roller-coaster scene necessitated 144 visual-effect shots. Custom-designed coaster cars were built and modified for the script; most of the model was hand-built and computer-designed [[Maya Embedded Language|MEL]] scripts added specific elements. For the coaster-crash scenes, the actors were filmed performing in front of a [[Chroma key|green screen]], to which a CGI background was added. Several of the roller-coaster's cars were suspended with [[bungee cord]]s to film the crash; the deaths required the use of CGI onscreen effects and each actor had a corresponding CGI double.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|last1=Bielik |first1=Alain |title='Final Destination 3': Going the Distance with VFX |url=http://www.awn.com/vfxworld/final-destination-3-going-distance-vfx |publisher=[[Animation World Network]] |date=February 10, 2006 |accessdate=June 22, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426233323/https://www.awn.com/vfxworld/final-destination-3-going-distance-vfx |archivedate=April 26, 2017 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

Meteor Studios produced the roller-coaster and subway crashes while Digital Dimension handled the post-premonition death scenes. The death of Ian McKinley, who is bisected by a cherry picker, proved especially challenging. A clean plate of the cherry picker falling was originally shot with a plate of Lemche acting crushed and falling to the ground with his bottom half in a partial green-screen suit. {{#tag:ref|A blank take (with no actor in the shot) is sometimes taken to give compositors a reference of what parts of the shot are different in each take. In common film-making language, this is also known as shooting a "plate".|group="note"}} After combining those plates, Wong said "he wanted more of a gruesome punch for the shot". A standard CGI body of Lemche's height was used; several animation simulations of the body being crushed with a CGI object were filmed. The director chose the version he liked most. A new plate was then filmed with Lemche imitating the chosen animation and positioning his body at the end. Soho VFX created the scene where Ashley and Ashlyn are killed on tanning beds. It consisted of about 35 shots of CG skin, glass, fire, and smoke mixed with real fire and smoke. The subway crash in the film's epilogue used a CG environment reproducing the main aspects  of the set.<ref name="auto2"/>

The score for ''Final Destination 3'' was composed by [[Shirley Walker]], who wrote the soundtracks of the series' previous installments. Score mixer Bobby Fernandez created a "gore-o-meter", measuring the violence of each death to ensure the score would match the scenes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldwasser |first1=Dan |title=Shirley Walker's Final Destination 3 kicks off 2006 with a scream |url=http://scoringsessions.com/2006/01/05/shirley-walkers-final-destination-3-kicks-off-2006-with-a-scream/ |website=''Scoring Sessions'' |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |date=January 5, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426233348/http://scoringsessions.com/2006/01/05/shirley-walkers-final-destination-3-kicks-off-2006-with-a-scream/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017 |deadurl=no}}</ref> ''Final Destination 3'' is the only film in the series without a commercially released soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miska |first1=Brad |title=Get Answers, Ask More Questions: Final Destination 5 Producer Craig Perry Round 4! |url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/25566/get-answers-ask-more-questions-final-destination-5-producer-craig-perry-round-4/ |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |accessdate=March 10, 2017 |date=July 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110245/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/25566/get-answers-ask-more-questions-final-destination-5-producer-craig-perry-round-4/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |deadurl=no}}</ref> Greek-American musician [[Tommy Lee]] provided a cover of [[The O'Jays]] 1972 song "[[Love Train]]", which was used in the film's closing credits.
