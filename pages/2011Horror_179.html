Thought to be a financial success due to Biehn's effort selling out theaters across the nation, neither he or producer Jennifer Blanc know final sales figures, due to open litigation with the film's investors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Borys|first=Kit|title=Anchor Bay Picks Up Michael Biehn's Directorial Debut|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anchor-bay-michael-biehn-victim-279173|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref>

Alan Cerny of [[Ain't It Cool News]] characterized ''The Victim'' as "a fun sleazy grindhouse film", in which Biehn was lauded for both giving a good performance and getting good performances out of his actors. Though Cerny stated that Biehn's directing effort exhibited imperfections such as a driving montage scene that he felt was too long, he appreciated that Biehn understood the genre in which he was working, commenting, "Biehn has a clear path to what he's shooting for, and for much of the film's running time, he gets it", and "It's a specific genre with a specific style, and working from that, Biehn gets way more right than he does wrong."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cerny|first=Alan|title=Nordling Says Michael Biehn's THE VICTIM Is A Fun Sleazy Grindhouse Film!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/51243|publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]|date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Directing his own screenplay, Mr. Biehn (working from a story by Reed Lackey) pays more attention to genitals than spatial coherence, unaware that labeling a film grind house doesn’t excuse soap-opera emoting and laughable dialogue. Wait, what am I saying? Of course it does."<ref name=NYT/> The film has a 35% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 17 reviews.
