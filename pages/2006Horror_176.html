'''''Silent Hill''''' is a 2006 Canadian-French [[supernatural]]  [[psychological horror]] film directed by [[Christophe Gans]] and written by [[Roger Avary]], Gans, and [[Nicolas Boukhrief]]. The film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of [[Konami]]'s video game series ''[[Silent Hill]]''. It stars [[Radha Mitchell]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Laurie Holden]], [[Deborah Kara Unger]], [[Kim Coates]], [[Tanya Allen]], [[Alice Krige]], and [[Jodelle Ferland]].

The film follows Rose, who takes her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, for which Sharon cries while [[sleepwalking]]. Arriving at Silent Hill, Rose is involved in a car accident and awakens to find Sharon missing; while searching for her daughter, she fights a local cult while uncovering Sharon's connection to the town's past.

Development of ''Silent Hill'' began in the early 2000s. After attempting to gain the film rights to ''Silent Hill'' for five years, Gans sent a video interview to them explaining his plans for adapting ''Silent Hill'' and how important the games are to him. Konami awarded him the film rights as a result. Gans and Avary began working on the script in 2004. Avary used [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] as an inspiration for the town. Filming began in February 2005 with an estimated $50 million budget and was shot on sound sets and on location in [[Canada]] ([[Brantford, Ontario]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]]).

''Silent Hill'' was released on April 21, 2006, grossing nearly $100 million worldwide. Film critics praised the film's visuals, set designs, and atmosphere, but criticized the film for its dialogue, plot, and run-time. A [[sequel]] entitled ''[[Silent Hill: Revelation]]'' was released on October 26, 2012 to critical failure, but modest commercial success.

==Plot==
Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are deeply disturbed by their adopted daughter [[Heather Mason|Sharon]]'s constant [[sleepwalking]] and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town that was abandoned 30 years ago due to a massive [[coal seam fire]]. Against Christopher's wishes, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behaviour concerns police officer [[Cybil Bennett]]. Rose flees from Cybil, but when a [[Alessa Gillespie|girl]] steps out into the road, Rose crashes and blacks out. Waking up some time later, Rose finds herself in the foggy dimension of Silent Hill and realizes that Sharon is missing.

Searching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the same girl she encountered prior to the crash, who turns out to resemble Sharon in appearance. At various points, the town transitions into a nightmarish dimension inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome [[Pyramid Head]]. Rose survives the transitions and consequently learns of the existence of [[Alessa Gillespie]], a young girl [[witch hunt|burnt]] by the Brethren, the town's fanatical cult. Her mother [[List of Silent Hill series characters#Dahlia Gillespie|Dahlia]] wanders the streets as an outcast, guilty for her negligence that led to Alessa's doom. Rose is later joined by Cybil, also trapped in the foggy dimension of the town due to a giant [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]] isolating Silent Hill. Meanwhile, in the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but their search is in vain. Upon finding a photo of Alessa, Christopher goes to the [[orphanage]] where Sharon was adopted. Gucci appears, revealing he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search and go home.

In the Silent Hill dimension, Rose and Cybil explore a hotel the Brethren once used, accompanied by Anna, a Brethren member, where they find the burnt remains of a ceremonial chamber. Rose also encounters the girl, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna flee to an old church but Pyramid Head emerges and skins Anna alive. Inside, Christabella, the [[high priest]]ess of the Brethren, and Alessa's aunt, suggests a "[[demon]]" knows where Sharon is. Her followers lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon is in the basement. Christabella sees a photo of Sharon from Rose's locket and brands Rose and Cybil as "witches" due to Sharon resembling Alessa. Cybil fights the Brethren members but Christabella orders them to violently beat her.

Rose enters the basement, but she is barricaded by a group of weapon-wielding nurses who appear to be almost completely blind due to their disfigured, covered faces. Although light and sound attract them, Rose manages to sneak through them, inadvertently startling them into attacking each other. She flees and enters Alessa's room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatised by the townspeople for being a [[Legitimacy (family law)|bastard]]. Christabella convinces Dahlia, a formerly devout Brethren member, to "purify" Alessa, after Alessa is raped whilst attempting to hide from her tormentors. Christabella immolates Alessa during a ritual but Dahlia realises this and alerts Gucci. They arrive too late as the ritual goes awry, igniting the infamous coal seam fire. Hospitalised, Alessa's rage grew and manifested as Dark Alessa, who is responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence is later manifested as Sharon, who is taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa to grant access to the church by fusing with her body. Meanwhile, Sharon, protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren.

In the church, Christabella burns Cybil to death and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose intervenes and confronts Christabella in regards to her crimes but Christabella stabs her in the heart in retaliation. Rose's blood summons both the original Alessa and Dark Alessa, who bisect and kill Christabella and her followers, except for Dahlia, with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and, upon seeing Dark Alessa, Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home. When they return home, it is revealed that they are still in the foggy dimension, separated from reality.  Meanwhile, Christopher is alone in the real world but discovers that the front door has mysteriously opened.

===Development===
Director [[Christophe Gans]] attempted for five years to obtain the film rights to the ''[[Silent Hill]]'' series from [[Konami]]. He sent a video interview to them explaining his plans for adapting ''Silent Hill'' and how important the games are to him.<ref name="comingsoon">{{cite web| last = Douglas| first = Edward| date = 2006-04-20| url = http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14165| title = Exclusive: Director Christophe Gans | work = ComingSoon}}</ref> They were so impressed, he was rewarded with the film rights.

''Silent Hill''{{'}}s screenwriter, Roger Avary, used the town of [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] as an inspiration for the town of Silent Hill;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silenthill.ugo.com/features/realsilenthill/default.asp|title=The Real Silent Hill|publisher=[[UGO]]|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413153435/http://silenthill.ugo.com/features/realsilenthill/default.asp|archivedate=April 13, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Avary commented that as a boy, his father, who was a mining engineer, used to tell him stories about Centralia, where coal deposits from the local mine caught fire and released toxic gases into the town, as well as creating [[sinkholes]] when the abandoned mineshafts and coal seams began to collapse. This forced the town to evacuate forever. Avary was fascinated since childhood by the idea that fires underneath the town would be burning for such a long time.<ref name="ecranlarge"/> When the script was finished, a studio memo was sent to Gans and Avary that voiced concerns about the lack of a male presence in the film, since the original story contained a nearly all female cast. Gans and Avary added Christopher's character (named after Gans) and subplot and the script was approved.<ref name="dvdrama" />

Gans described the concept of the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded."<ref name="1up">{{cite web| last = Bettenhausen| first = Shane| date = 2006-02-23| url = http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6605116&publicUserId=1002415| title = Silent Hill Movie Interview: The Director's Cut| work = 1UP| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/68D7S1pfU?url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=6605116&publicUserId=1002415| archivedate = June 6, 2012| df = mdy-all}}</ref> He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is "in [Alessa's] head".<ref>{{harvnb|Gans|2009|loc=chapter 11}}</ref> "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." In speaking about the creatures in ''Silent Hill'', Gans said that "these monsters are [damned], with the poetic direction of the term: they are a little like the Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [guilt]."<ref name="ecranlarge" /> "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew that it was impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you."<ref name="1up" />

The film was greenlit on September 19, 2003. [[Principal photography]] commenced on April 25, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/2151/silent-hill-begins-production|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121082832/http://www.darkhorizons.com/news/2151/silent-hill-begins-production|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 21, 2013|title=Silent Hill Begins Production|last=Franklin|first=Garth|publisher=Dark Horizons|date=April 29, 2005|accessdate=August 30, 2012}}</ref> It was filmed in both [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]<ref name=hamfilm>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/List?endings=on&&locations=Hamilton,+Ontario,+Canada |title=Internet Movie Database – List of Films shot in Hamilton, Ontario|accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref> as well as on soundstages in [[Toronto]] in 2005 and on location in [[Alma College (St. Thomas, Ontario)|Alma College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almacollege.20m.com/photopages/silentHill.htm |title=Silent Hill filmed at Alma College |publisher=Almacollege.20m.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref> American studio [[Sony Pictures]] bought the distribution rights for $14 million for the United States and [[Latin America]] to be released under its [[TriStar Pictures]] [[genre film]] subsidiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14210 |title=ComingSoon.net |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}{{deadurl|date=June 2018}}</ref>

===Casting===
Gans said that casting of Mitchell as the lead for the film is "a matter of feeling. If you play ''Silent Hill'' you know that each character has a very special poetic quality. They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to keep that in mind when we did the casting on this film."{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Bean's role in the film was originally kept to the beginning and the end of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot.<ref name="dvdrama">{{cite web| last = Prin| first = Kevin| date = 2006-12-22| url = http://www.dvdrama.com/news.php?18185| title = INTERVIEW: CHRISTOPHE GANS (SILENT HILL) PARTIE 1 (French)| work = DVDRama}}</ref> Gans cast Holden after seeing her in ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]'': "in ''The Majestic'', she was beautifully feminine and I cast her so I could show her other side, make her strong and sleek.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Gans saw Ferland as "the ideal actress" after viewing the television show ''Kingdom Hospital'' and her screen test for [[Terry Gilliam]]'s film ''[[Tideland (film)|Tideland]]''.<ref name="ecranlarge">{{cite web| last = Ferry| first = IIan| date = 2006-04-02| url = http://www.ecranlarge.com/interview-282.php| title = Master Class Silent Hill (French)| work = Ecranlarge| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061007185326/http://www.ecranlarge.com/interview-282.php| archivedate = October 7, 2006| df = mdy-all}}</ref> To prepare for her role, Krige read the book ''The End of Days'' by [[Erna Paris]], a book about tyranny during the [[Spanish Inquisition]].<ref name="prodnotes">{{cite web| url = http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/silenthill/site/html/prodnotes.html| title = Silent Hill – Production Notes | work = Sony Pictures}}</ref>

===Filming===
The movie was filmed in the [[Super 35]] film format, except the scenes with the darkness, which were filmed in [[high-definition video]],<ref name="about">{{cite web| last = Wilson| first = Stacy| date = 2005-07-17| url = http://horror.about.com/od/movierelated/a/int_sh_gans.htm| title = "Silent Hill" Interview with director Christophe Gans| work = About| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912090529/http://horror.about.com/od/movierelated/a/int_sh_gans.htm| archivedate = September 12, 2006| df = mdy-all}}</ref> because of its ability to cleanly capture light and digitally manipulate it in post production. The film contains around 107 different sets<ref>{{cite web| last = Thorpe| first = Valarie| date = 2005-07-17| url = http://www.reallyscary.com/setvisit_silenthill.asp| title = Really Scary Visits the Set of Silent Hill | work = Really Scary}}</ref> specifically used to represent the different versions of the town. The bipedal creatures in the film were played by professional actors or dancers covered in [[latex]] and [[prosthetic makeup]]. After filming, over 619 visual effects shots were used in the film,<ref>{{cite web| last = Bielik| first = Alain| date = 2006-04-21| url = http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&code=319b255d&atype=articles&id=2858| title = Silent Hill: Nothing Quiet About These Horrifying VFX  | work = VFXWorld}}</ref> with the most prominent uses being the fog that drenches the town, the transitions to darkness, and the insects that surround Pyramid Head. Some of the creatures were also touched up in post-production, with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects such as the burning on the Grey Children, the changes in the dimensions of the Armless creature's legs, the disease that the Janitor spreads, and the barbed wire during Alessa's revenge.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In order to maintain the feel of the games, Gans had the sound designer of the original ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'', [[Akira Yamaoka]], flown to the set several times.<ref name=yama>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3281/heavens_night_an_interview_with_.php?page=2 |title=Interview with Akira Yamaoka |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> Additionally, Gans had a 40-inch television brought onto the set, to which he attached a [[PlayStation 2]]; Gans then played the original ''Silent Hill'' on the system so that the actors and cinematographers could see how Gans wanted to emulate various camera angles and movements.<ref name="yama" />

Budgetary concerns caused a few scenes in the film to be rewritten. The meeting of Anna in the film had been envisioned differently. It originally featured Anna being attacked by an injured armless creature, where she is saved by Cybil and Rose. Due to budget concerns, choreographer Roberto Campanella was sent home for the day, and without him the scene did not meet Gans's expectations. To rectify this, the scene was simplified and rewritten.<ref name="dvdrama" /> Gans stated that his original vision of the film's finale revolved around six Red Pyramids appearing inside the church, each carrying a different weapon, and slaughtering the cult members in reference to [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]].<ref name="dvdrama" /> When budgetary and time constraints prevented this ending from being filmed, he created the new ending that revolved around the barbed wire slaying of the cult by Alessa, which was inspired by the erotic anime ''[[Urotsukidōji|Legend of the Overfiend]]''.<ref name="dvdrama" />

===Soundtrack===
The [[film score|score]] consists almost entirely of music from Yamaoka's soundtracks to the original four games in the series. The only other piece of music used in the film is [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]". Yamaoka's scores were arranged by film composer [[Jeff Danna]], with some tracks appearing in almost identical form to their in-game counterparts, while others were recreated entirely.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==Release==
''Silent Hill'' was released to theaters on April 21, 2006 in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Ireland. France, Belgium, Hungary, and Greece also saw April releases. The film was later released in 19 other countries in 2006 which include Russia, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Mexico. The film's poster of a mouthless Alessa was the subject of some [[vandalism]], with many malefactors drawing cartoon mouths (smiling, screaming, sporting vampire fangs, etc.) or placing stickers where her mouth would be.<ref>{{cite news| last = Dziemianowicz| first = Joe| date = 2006-04-12| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2006/04/12/2006-04-12_read_my_lips___a_film_poster.html| title = Read my lips, a film poster inspires self-expression| work = New York Daily News| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604070720/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2006/04/12/2006-04-12_read_my_lips___a_film_poster.html| archivedate = June 4, 2011| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a score of D+, stating that "a few of the images are startling" but "''Silent Hill'' is mostly paralyzing in its vagueness."<ref>{{cite news|author=Owen Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1187454,00.html |title=Silent Hill Review &#124; Movie Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' opined that "above-average interest is generated for a time by [the] elaborate visual package," but "in the end, ''Silent Hill'' degenerates into an overblown replay of all those ''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'' and [[Stephen King]] stories in which outsiders stumble upon a time-warped location from which there's no escape."<ref name="variety">{{cite news|last=Barraclough |first=Leo |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930293.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |title=Silent Hill |publisher=Variety |date=2006-04-21 |accessdate=2013-09-07}}</ref> According to Nathan Lee of ''[[The New York Times]]'': "It begins as a quest, develops into a ghost-town mystery, devolves into a preposterous cautionary tale about witchcraft and religious fundamentalism, and wraps up like the outrageously overwrought fantasy of a movie nerd obsessed with horror who has been given obscene amounts of money to adapt a video game."<ref>Nathan Lee, [https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/04/22/movies/22sile.html 'Silent Hill' Is a Free Fall Through a Nightmare World], ''The New York Times'', April 22, 2006.</ref>

{{main article|Silent Hill: Revelation}}
A sequel, ''[[Silent Hill: Revelation]]'', taking place six years after the first film's events, was released on October 26, 2012. [[Christophe Gans]] could not direct the sequel because he was busy directing an ''[[Onimusha]]'' film adaptation. [[Roger Avary]] was originally attached to write the screenplay and had written the first draft before he was arrested for vehicular manslaughter on November 2010. [[Michael J. Bassett]] was later hired to write and direct the sequel. The sequel was panned by critics, holding a 7% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/silent_hill_revelation_3d_2012/|title=Silent Hill: Revelation 3D|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}</ref>
