==Reception==
[[Shock Till You Drop]] criticized the film for its poor acting and plot, but also remarked that it also "functions primarily as an attempt to keep the carnival-scumbag vibe of vintage [[Herschell Gordon Lewis|H.G. Lewis]], David Friedman and [[Doris Wishman]] alive and well" and that appreciated these aspects of ''Death-Scourt Service.''<ref>{{Cite web|title = DVD Review: DEATH-SCORT SERVICE|url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/reviews/391169-dvd-review-death-scort-service/|website = Shock Till You Drop|accessdate = 2015-11-26|language = en-US|last = Alexander|first = Chris}}</ref> HorrorNews.net wrote a mostly favorable review for the movie, stating "At the end of the day, there's absolutely nothing about ''Death-Scort Service'' that's subtle; it hits you repeatedly about the head and neck until the final credits roll. Sometimes it's with nudity, sometimes it's with violence. Occasionally, you get both. Again, that's definitely not a complaint. I found myself enjoying the flick even when I felt dirty, which, I guess, is a compliment. Donohue and company know their audience is filled with filthy freaks, and they're more than happy to supply our demand."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Death-Scort Service (2015) - Review|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/121137/death-scort-service-2015/|website = Dread Central|accessdate = 2015-11-26|last = Rigney|first = Todd}}</ref>
