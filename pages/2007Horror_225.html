'''''HP Lovecraft's The Tomb''''' is a 2007 [[United States]] production [[horror film]] that is supposedly based on [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'s 1917 story, [[The Tomb (short story)|"The Tomb"]]. 
However, the plot of the film is completely unrelated to the Lovecraft short story.<ref name="Unrelated1">[http://www.filmmonthly.com/steve_anderson/hp_lovecrafts_the_tomb.html H.P. Lovecraftâ€™s The Tomb reviewed by Steve Anderson]</ref><ref name="Unrelated2">[http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/tomb-the-dvd Dread Central review]</ref><ref name="Unrelated3">[http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/thetomb.php DVD Verdict review]</ref> The film was compared to the 2004 movie, ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', and the series was mentioned on the box art. The film is also known simply as ''The Tomb'', but the title on the DVD case is ''HP Lovecraft's The Tomb''. However, on the film itself the title is "H.P. Lovecraft [sic] The Tomb" with no apostrophe + s. The movie was directed by [[Ulli Lommel]].

==Plot==
Tara (Victoria Ullmann) and Billy (Christian Behm) awake in a dark basement or warehouse, bloodied and covered with wounds. As they explore the empty surroundings, they find other wounded people who die in horrible ways at the hands of "The Puppetmaster," a sinister villain who plays a deadly game with them in which there will be only one survivor. H.P. Lovecraft is mentioned several times during the course of the film by some characters, and the 'Puppetmaster' is referred to as '[[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward|Charles Dexter Ward]]' and one of his victims as 'Pickman' (a reference to Lovecraft's story [[Pickman's Model]]). However these passing references to Lovecraftian characters (and a quote from one of Lovecraft's stories about going "beyond ye spheres") are largely irrelevant to the serial killer plot played out on screen.

==Filming==
Production of ''HP Lovecraft's The Tomb'' took place during August 2005 in [[Marina Del Rey, California]], at a warehouse on Princeton Drive that has since been demolished. The scenes at the "Palm Desert Motel" were shot on an indoor set at the same warehouse. Exteriors were shot in the high desert near [[Palmdale, California]].

Co-executive producer Jeff Frentzen is wearing the black gloves of the killer throughout the film.
