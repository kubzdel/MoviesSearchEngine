==Reception==
Despite scathing reviews of his latest movie, ''The Faith Of Anna Waters'', [[Kelvin Tong]] remains nonchalant. He told ''[[The New Paper]]'': "I'm so used to being slammed, so negative reviews don't affect me any more."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Soh|first1=Joanne|title=Kelvin Tong: 'I'm so used to being slammed'|url=http://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/kelvin-tong-im-so-used-being-slammed|website=[[The New Paper]]|accessdate=2016-05-15|date=10 May 2016}}</ref>

''[[Fangoria]]'''s Michael Gingold: "It's never clear, plotwise, what is supposed to be on offer in ''THE OFFERING'', though anyone with any familiarity with occult flicks will find they're being sold a very secondhand bill of goods."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gingold|first1=Michael|title=THE OFFERING (Movie Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/the-offering-movie-review/|website=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=2016-05-16|date=6 May 2016}}</ref>

''[[The New York Times]]''' Andy Webster: "a muddled horror film, falls over itself incorporating as many genre elements as possible. The result is the cinematic equivalent of combining every paint color on a canvas: a murky mess."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Webster|first1=Andy|title=Review: The Offering: No, Thank You|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/movies/the-offering-review.html?_r=0|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-05-15|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''s John DeFore: "Tong employs so many shock cuts and grating music cues viewers will likely find their curiosity fading quickly. What it all adds up to is either laughably baffling or just plain laughable, depending on how much attention one has paid."<ref>{{cite web|last1=DeFore|first1=John|title=The Offering: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/offering-film-review-892792|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2016-05-15|date=11 May 2016}}</ref>
