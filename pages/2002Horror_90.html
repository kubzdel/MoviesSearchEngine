==Plot==
Christin works in a hotel owned by Budcasso, the fiancé of her friend, Zidane. When she is caught embezzling company funds, she turns to Zidane for help but Zidane refuses. Christin then pretends to attempt suicide, hoping that Budcasso would take pity on her, but her stunt goes wrong and she really dies. As she was wearing a red dress when she died, she becomes a [[vengeful ghost]] after death and returns to take her revenge. Meanwhile, Budcasso invites his ex-wife, Mrs Bud Lung, to attend his upcoming wedding. A rivalry ensues between Mrs Bud Lung, a traditional Chinese ghostbuster, and Zidane, who is well-versed in Western occult arts. However, they eventually become friends after joining forces to destroy the malevolent ghost of Christin. As Budcasso fears the supernatural, he abandons Zidane in the same manner he did to his ex-wife after seeing that his new fiancée is another ghostbuster.
