==Plot==
Anita "Needy" Lesnicki, once an insecure and bookish teenager living near [[Judge C. R. Magney State Park#The Devil's Kettle|Devil's Kettle]],  [[Minnesota]], is now a violent [[Mental disorder|mental]] inmate who narrates the story as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] while in [[solitary confinement]]. Since childhood, she had been friends with a selfish and popular cheerleader, Jennifer Check, despite having little in common. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local [[dive bar]] to attend a concert by [[indie rock]] band Low Shoulder. A suspicious fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. In shock, Jennifer agrees to leave with the band despite Needy's protests. Later that evening, Jennifer, covered in blood, appears in Needy's kitchen and proceeds to eat food from the refrigerator. Unable to digest it, she vomits a trail of black, spiny fluid and then leaves in a hurry as Needy calls after her.

The next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and shrugs off Needy's concerns. While the whole town is devastated by the deaths caused by the fire, Jennifer seduces the school's football captain in the woods and then kills him; his [[disemboweled]] corpse is later found. Meanwhile, the members of Low Shoulder gain popularity due to their rumored [[heroism]] during the fire and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.

A month later, Jennifer is beginning to look pale, so she accepts a date with school [[Goth subculture|goth]]/[[emo]] Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief [[Making out|makeout]] session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her into the woods and offered her as a [[Virginity|virgin]] [[Human sacrifice|sacrifice]] to [[Satan]] in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a [[demon]]ic spirit [[Demonic possession|took over her body]]. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.

At school the following day, the town is stunned by Colin's death. Needy goes to the school library's [[occult]] section and determines that Jennifer is a [[succubus]]; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed with a pool skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.

Needy decides she must kill Jennifer. She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook. Crashing through the window with a box cutter, Needy fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart, destroying the demon and killing her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter on top of her daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an [[Insane asylum|asylum]]. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability to [[levitation (paranormal)|hover in the air]]. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Needy then escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying, and brutally murders them all.

==Cast==
* [[Megan Fox]] as Jennifer Check:
: Fox was in negotiations to star as Jennifer Check since the film was announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007.<ref>{{cite news | author= Mr. Disgusting | title= Megan Fox to Star in Supernatural-Comedy 'Jennifer's Body' | url= http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | publisher= [[Bloody Disgusting]] | date= October 23, 2007 | accessdate= February 11, 2008 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120203404/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10237 | archivedate= November 20, 2008 | df= mdy-all }}</ref> Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," she said. "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun to be able to say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming."<ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /> Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', Fox said "there's [no] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible".<ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /> She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," said Fox. "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works."<ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" /> To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on [[Diablo Cody]]'s script and [[Karyn Kusama]]'s direction to pull it off, stating, "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that."<ref name="shocktillyoudrop.com">{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Rotten |title= Megan Fox Talks Jennifer's Body FX |publisher=shocktillyoudrop.com |date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2009 |url=http://shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11239 }}</ref>

==Production==

===Development===
''Jennifer's Body'' is the follow-up to writer and producer Diablo Cody's and Jason Reitman's collaboration efforts on ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]].'' In October 2007, [[Fox Atomic]] pre-emptively purchased the rights to Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, who at the time oversaw [[Fox Searchlight Pictures|Fox Searchlight]] and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film ''Juno''.<ref name="Cody Body">{{cite news|last=Kit |first=Borys |last2=Simmons |first2=Leslie |title=Atomic has Cody 'Body,' Fox part |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 23, 2007 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i55bff7bc1a68ecefd1ee67eb5979e4fb |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110213754/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i55bff7bc1a68ecefd1ee67eb5979e4fb |archivedate=January 10, 2010 }} {{Subscription}}</ref> Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight.

Cody stated that when writing the script, she was "simultaneously trying to pay tribute to some of the conventions that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film ''[[The Lost Boys]]''. She wanted to "honor that, and at the same time, [she] had never really seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [she] tried to do a little of both".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> Despite this, she said she had noticed that "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" and that because of this she feels "horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". ''Jennifer's Body'' could play on both of these aspects.<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

Cody said she wanted the film to speak to female empowerment and explore the complex relationships between best friends.<ref name=in.reuters.com/> "(Director) Karyn Kusama and I are both outspoken [[Feminism|feminists]]", she said. "We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men."<ref name=in.reuters.com/> Addressing "the male-dominated" horror genre, Cody said "a key reason for writing the film was to bring to the screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the "almost horrific" aspect of such devotion and its relation to [[parasitism]].<ref name=in.reuters.com/>

The producers decided to have the film open with the statement "Hell is a teenage girl" to reflect the "horrors" of [[puberty]] and that "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women".<ref name=in.reuters.com/> Cody stated: <blockquote>There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought that was such a sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment sitting in front of the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [Megan Fox] is stunning.<ref name=in.reuters.com/></blockquote>

Cody crafted the story to follow a night that ends in a tragic fire, after which Jennifer is kidnapped and set up as a sacrifice which goes awry.

I think it's always really satisfying and cathartic to see a character that was previously bullied become super human", said Cody.<ref name=in.reuters.com/> Cody said the script is not a reflection of any part of her own life, but that she is more like character Needy. "I would say I was more of a Needy than a Jennifer. I was never an [[Alpha (biology)|Alpha female]], and I've never gotten off with bullying other people", she said. "If I had to choose, I was definitely the one being shoved, not the one shoving."<ref name=in.reuters.com/>

The nickname "Needy" was given to Seyfried's character to underline the essentially condescending dynamic in Jennifer and Needy's high school relationship,<ref name="sfweekly.com">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Pinkerton|title=Jennifer's Body|publisher=[[Sci Fi Weekly]]|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2009|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/movies/jennifers-body-1279788/}}</ref> as Needy often admires Jennifer and feels she needs her. Cody said "Jennifer is a product of a culture that pressures girls to be skinny, beautiful and just like movie stars" and that she "hopes the film inspires girls to take life into their own hands and do with it, what they want".<ref name=in.reuters.com/> "If I had gone to this movie as a teenage girl, I would've come out of it feeling totally inspired", she stated. "I would've wanted to write, I would've wanted to create and I would've felt like I watched something that was speaking to me."<ref name=in.reuters.com/>

Assigned to direct the film, Kusama said, "I think also a lot of horror is about femaleness – whether it's ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' or ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]''."<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> She said she feels "like there's a lot of fear of the female or kind of celebration of it in some weird way and something about this movie managed to take the fear and the sense that it's the female that ultimately survives and sort of marry that in a really interesting way".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

Addressing her decision to have Jennifer and Needy be romantically intimate at one point during the film, which takes place in the form of a long and passionate kissing scene, Cody said she did not write the scene to score publicity.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/> Speaking of the scene's media hype, she said that "if the two protagonists of the film were a guy and a girl and in a particularly tense moment, they shared a kiss, no one would say it was gratuitous" but "the fact that they're women means it's some kind of stunt". The scene was "intended to be something profound and meaningful" to her and Kusama.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/> She further stated:

<blockquote>Obviously we knew people were going to totally sensationalize it. They're beautiful girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [your] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.<ref name=www.afterellen.com/></blockquote>

Though the film is part comedy, Cody initially intended for it to be a "very dark, very brooding" traditional slasher film. Close to "a third of the way into the process" she felt that she was incapable of doing so because "the humor just kept sneaking in". She stated, "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of the things in the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." Feeling that "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way."<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

=== Design and effects ===
[[Image:Jennifer's Body, demon within.jpg|thumb|right|One of the makeup designs in the film for Jennifer's mouth while the character is in demonic form. Fox explained that the jaw unhinges sort of like a [[snake]]'s so that Jennifer can "fully envelop" her victims.<ref name="maximotv">{{cite news|title=Megan Fox on the 'Make-Up Process' for Jennifer's Body at Hot Topic Event|publisher=maximotv|date=September 16, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2009}}</ref> Unlike a snake, the character has long, sharp teeth in order to tear the flesh from her victims' bodies as she eats them.]]

Handling the film's [[special effect]]s were KNB EFX GROUP and the [[Moving Picture Company]] (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used different techniques. "I actually wasn't in [the makeup chair] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of me from the shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. "To save my face, they had a photo double that would come in and do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together."<ref name=shocktillyoudrop.com/>

For the "vomit scene" where Jennifer has just arrived at Needy's house after being murdered and inhabited by a demon, Fox said the liquid she was given to spit out "was actually ...chocolate syrup initially".<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> "We did a few takes where I would just do this scream and sort of puke [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]]'s chocolate syrup. Scratch the Hershey's because I don't want to endorse that or anything", she stated. "And then, special effects did a rig that clamps onto my ear and you revisit it in the pool scene..." Fox said it "clips on. It goes around the back of my ear and then I bite down on it on the side of my face, like this, and it projectiles. It's a tube..."<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

Directing the scene, Kusama said it had a classic feel. Fox agreed, "Yeah, and it projects whatever that material was. I'm not sure. It was pretty intense. I think it was worse for [Seyfried] because she's the one that got puked on. I was the one doing the puking."<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

For more practical special effects on the set as opposed to [[Computer graphics|CG]], Kusama said it "was a choice that we all sort of made organically". She said they appreciate "those kind of effects in older movies and [questions] sometimes how much more effective it is to use a ton of CG" and that they "always started with a practical effect and then moved forward from there to lay a groundwork of something that's actually physically, materially there". They found this to be more enjoyable.<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>
{{Quote_box|width=35%|align=left|quote="Before we started shooting, it involved the full appliance attached to [Fox's] face and then her real jaw would be [[Chroma key|greened]] essentially inside of her mouth and then the appliance would drop below her real jaw and then visual effects essentially owned everything in her mouth and everything outside would've been a special effects appliance. And then there would've been a lot of clean up as well because of the way it attached to her face."|source=—Erik Nordby on the construction of Jennifer's demonic mouth and jaw<ref name=www.awn.com/>}}

Erik Nordby of KNB (known for his work on ''[[The Haunting in Connecticut]]'', which also features co-star [[Kyle Gallner]]) stated, "We immediately went into pitch mode in January and spent a solid two weeks trying to not only bid the script but also collect as much reference material and stuff for the first client get together."<ref name="www.awn.com">{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Desowitz|title=Jennifer's Body: Jaw Dropping VFX|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/feature/ijennifers-bodyi-jaw-dropping-vfx}}</ref> He said the director and producers wanted an "old-school, hands-off, lo-fi approach to the visual effects" so that the horror elements would not overpower the storyline.<ref name=www.awn.com/> Based on the script, MPC similarly came to the same conclusion and "provided a clear direction" for Nordby and his team. "At that point when we met with them, they had already met with KNB, who had already done up a stylized still of what, at the time, they were calling 'Evil Jennifer,'" he said. "There was a lot of info yet to come, but based on the script, Jennifer goes from very beautiful Megan Fox to a very ghoulish, succubus creature whose jaw distends half-way down her face." Nordby said the look was eventually toned down at the wishes of MPC. From there, KNB "produced some tests, grabbing a bunch of stills from [Fox] and [did their] work to indicate how that balance could exist between special effects and visual effects and still maintain a level of subtlety" and that "[MPC] responded really well".<ref name=www.awn.com/>

The teams wanted to "maintain some sort of the Megan Fox allure" but said that it was "incredibly difficult because as soon as [they] warped her face in any direction, the shine kind of came off it". To combat this, they ended up focusing on anything below her nose, where they had the freedom to make things "as horrific as [they] needed to" and then above her nose, "[they] could manipulate it somewhat with warps and color correction in her eye sockets. So even at her worst, she had some of that sexiness throughout".<ref name=www.awn.com/>

Nordby said most of the attention was devoted to Jennifer's face and that "very quickly in combination" with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:<blockquote>Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain like the rest of us. And stage four was some custom [[dentures]] that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] and a variety of other musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.<ref name=www.awn.com/></blockquote>

During testing, Nordby and the special effects teams realized that getting Fox in and out of the appliance used to create Jennifer's murderous jaw would be too time-consuming. To remedy this, they hired a photo double. "[E]very day (for about 10 days) she would sit in a chair with this full appliance on her and we would shoot this jaw, and then all [Fox] would have to do is the dentures", stated Nordby. He said that "when it came time to shoot any of these jaw moments, [Fox] would act out in rehearsal how she was going to attack her victim and [they would] fine tune that blocking so it was relatively locked".<ref name="www.awn.com" /> The camera accompanied them in the same way, as "it would roll and she would put her dentures in, and they would really distort her face" in a way that would produce a satisfying and nice side effect. Additionally, the team would have Fox wear [[contact lens]]es and go through exactly the same motions as normal Jennifer. "But then I would shoot all the key poses that existed in whatever moves the digital double was doing, so that we had as much of that appliance in that lighting condition that we could get", said Nordby. "KNB also created a hairless but high detailed head of the stage five Jennifer that had an articulating jaw."<ref name="www.awn.com" />
[[Image:Fire and Jennifer's demon eyes.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Seyfried (left) as Needy during the fire which leads to Jennifer's kidnapping, and Fox (right) as demonic Jennifer a month after the incident; the special effects teams recessed the character's eyes and added a pinning effect to her irises, along with a variety of other musculature deforms to create the illusion.<ref name="www.awn.com" />]]

Nordby spent a significant amount of time shooting "the articulating jaw" scene because they had "ultimate control over how the light was hitting the head". He said, "This so-called jaw shot became a pivotal point, because for four months of the post, the filmmakers thought the film was getting too scary so MPC pulled back on the jaw and then they thought it wasn't scary enough."<ref name="www.awn.com" /> Because of this, "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film."<ref name="www.awn.com" /> Since the team was on a small budget, they "relied more on skilled artists to think through shots rather than a brute force approach".<ref name="www.awn.com" />

MPC additionally worked on the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed at the beginning of the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had a lot of confidence in our water sims", stated Nordby. "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over."<ref name="www.awn.com" /> They could not lock it to a [[Panning (camera)|pan]] or to a [[View camera#Tilt|tilt]] and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." Dealing with "very shallow" water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.<ref name="www.awn.com" />

During the film's fire scene, Cody appears as a character in the barroom. "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics and all that stuff which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that [[Burt Reynolds]] had done it once", stated Cody. "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough."<ref name="www.moviesonline.ca" />

=== Filming ===
In late 2007, Fox Atomic had plans to film ''Jennifer's Body'' before a possible writer's strike. When the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007–present)|Writers Guild of America strike]] began, shooting was then moved to March 7, 2008, in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], specifically at Robert Burnaby Park near Cariboo Hill Secondary School. Some of the scenes, particularly those situated in a school setting, were filmed in local [[Vancouver]]-area schools such as [[Vancouver Technical Secondary School]], [[Langley Secondary School]] and [[University Hill Secondary School]].

Fox said that while filming her highly anticipated kissing scene with Seyfried that Seyfried was "extremely uncomfortable" but that she herself was not. "I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [Seyfried] than kissing any of the other people that I had to kiss", she said.<ref name="moviesblog.mtv.com">{{cite web | first = Adam | last = Rosenberg | title = Megan Fox Talks About Her 'Jennifer's Body' Kiss With Amanda Seyfried |publisher= MTV|date= August 31, 2009 |accessdate= September 26, 2009 |url= http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/08/31/megan-fox-talks-about-her-jennifers-body-kiss-with-amanda-seyfried/ }}</ref> Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused "giggling fits" between takes.<ref name=moviesblog.mtv.com/> Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes.<ref name=wWw.afterellen.com/> She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene.

=== Music ===
Music was incorporated as an essential part of the film; there are "very specific bands" placed in band posters in some parts, such as in the selection of the band poster on the walls of the bar.<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/> Kusama said "[t]he music was a huge component of the movie" and this is first evident with "the songs that we see and hear performed, but then, just the vibe of the movie actually". She said, "As the movie progresses, it becomes a pretty clearly music-oriented movie. It's sort of a youth movie. Some of those bands were totally made up and some of them are not."<ref name=www.moviesonline.ca/>

=== Box office ===
Though the film was expected to pull in a significant number of the late teenage/[[Young adult (psychology)|young adult]] audience, particularly males aged 17 and older, while Cody hoped for a large female turnout,<ref name=in.reuters.com/> it earned a "disappointing" $2.8&nbsp;million on its opening Friday and $6.8&nbsp;million its opening weekend at the North American [[box office]]; the film placed #5, while [[3-D film|3D]] animated film ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]] ''placed #1 with $30.1&nbsp;million.<ref name=theboxofficejunkie.com/><ref name="hollywoodreporter.com">{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0d52172227325f28c4c19ec7af9c3317 | title = 'Cloudy' wins weekend boxoffice | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date = September 20, 2009 }}</ref><ref name="lexib.net">{{cite web |author= LexiB |title= Jennifer's Body D.O.A in Weekend Box Office |publisher= LexiB |date= September 21, 2009 |accessdate= September 25, 2009 |url= http://lexib.net/2009/09/jennifer%e2%80%99s-body-doa-in-weekend-box-office/ }}</ref> Produced for $16&nbsp;million, ''Jennifer's Body'' did manage to attract the sizable female audience Cody wanted; 51% were female, with 70% of patrons under age 25.<ref name=hollywoodreporter.com/> The film had been expected to benefit somewhat from its heavily marketed lesbian kissing scene between Fox and Seyfried, which, in addition to Fox being in the film, was thought to entice and successfully attract male viewers.<ref name=wWw.afterellen.com/><ref name=movies.ign.com/> Critic Jim Vejvoda at IGN stated that such a scene is not as shocking as it was in past decades and cannot be expected to significantly pull in an audience.<ref name="movies.ign.com">{{cite web | author = Jim Vejvoda | date = September 17, 2009 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/101/1019379p1.html| title = Jennifer's Body Review.

Box-office analysts and critics debated the film's underperformance. Analyst Jeff Bock, of Exhibitor Relations, reasoned the film underperformed at the box office due to two reasons; the first, he said, is the genre. Bock stated that Americans get horror and comedy, but with the idea "of those two things together in one place, people suddenly get very dumb".<ref name="www.eonline.com">{{cite web|first=Leslie|last=Gornstein|title=Did Jennifer's Body Bomb Because of Megan Fox?|publisher=[[E!]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2009|url= http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/ask_the_answer_bitch/b145273_did_jennifers_body_bomb_because_of.html }}</ref> "The horror-comedy genre is the toughest sell in Hollywood", he said. He noted films ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'', ''[[Slither (2006 film)|Slither]]'', ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', ''[[Eight Legged Freaks]]'' and [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''The Evil Dead'' series]], and said that while many of those are considered critical and business successes, "none of them have brought in the megabucks that a simple horror or comedy can."<ref name=www.eonline.com/> In addition, he labeled the ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'' franchise as more "straight-up horror" than comedy and stated ''[[Zombieland]]''{{'}}s box office performance would determine the horror-comedy genre's current viability.<ref name=www.eonline.com/>

Despite other R-rated horror films having centered around teenagers, some such as ''Scream'' having been successful, Bock said the second reason ''Jennifer's Body'' under-performed at the box office is the R-rating, which he described as a "killer" for the film. He said the film is set in high school and "sounds like the perfect package for teens" but that "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" and the studio was left with "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?"<ref name=www.eonline.com/> Nicole Sperling of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the [[Matt Damon]] film ''[[The Informant!]]'' and [[Jennifer Aniston]] film ''[[Love Happens]]'', she concluded that this may support "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" and that it takes more than a name to open a film.<ref name="hollywoodinsider.ew.com">{{cite web|first=Nicole|last=Sperling|title=Box Office: 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' soars; 'Jennifer's Body' sinks|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 22, 2009|url= http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120902183020/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/09/box-office-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-soars-jennifers-body-sinks/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= September 2, 2012 }}</ref> S.T.

The first, he said, is the distributor. "[[20th Century Fox]]'s genre wing, [[Fox Atomic]], had ''Jennifer's Body'' in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. "Instead of offloading the film to [[Fox Searchlight]], which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild ''Juno'' to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" and "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a "[b]ig mistake" and that "[y]ou'd have to go back to ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'' to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully."<ref name=www.movieline.com/> He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.<ref name=www.movieline.com/> 
[[File:Diably Cody Jennifers Body TIFF09.jpg|thumb|left|Cody (center) at ''Jennifer's Body'' screening at the [[2009 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]

VanAirsdale cited the release date and [[Film screening|screening]] as the third and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that [[Toronto]] is "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" and that "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows."<ref name=www.movieline.com/> The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned [[Ty Burr]]'s review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" and that "[t]he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two sides of the same coin. Who's the monster, and who made the monster? Sorry if you wanted ''Heathers'' with demons, fellas. Equipment's cheap these days; perhaps make your own?"<ref name=www.movieline.com/>

Hollywood.com box-office analyst and President Paul Dergarabedian said "the poor numbers don't mean Fox can't open a movie."<ref name="www.usmagazine.com">{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aniston, Megan Fox Bomb at the Box Office|publisher=[[Us Weekly]]|date=September 21, 2009|accessdate=September 21, 2009|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/jen-aniston-and-megan-fox-2009219}}</ref> "It may be a matter of just choosing the right projects for her", he told the ''[[Associated Press]].''

== Graphic novel == <!-- [[Jennifer's Body (comics)]] redirects here -->
As a [[tie-in]] to the film, [[Boom! Studios]] produced a ''Jennifer's Body'' [[graphic novel]]. The novel expands on the film's universe and Jennifer's murders of the boys. It was written by Black Metal's [[Rick Spears]], with the first nine pages illustrated by [[Jim Mahfood]] (''[[Clerks. (comics)|Clerks]]''). Two covers, in Fox's likeness, were designed; one for the direct market by Eric Jones (available only in comic specialty stores), and the other by [[Frank Cho]] for the mass market focusing more on "hellish Jennifer stories" with art by Mahfood, [[Hack/Slash]]'s Tim Seely, [[DMZ (comics)|DMZ's]] Nikki Cook, and Popgun's Ming Doyle. The novel was released in August 2009.<ref name="Shocktillyoudrop.com">{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Rotten|title=EXCL: First Look at the Jennifer's Body Graphic Novel|publisher=shocktillyoudrop.com|date=July 15, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/comicsnews.php?id=11082}}</ref><ref name="usatoday.com">{{cite web | first=Brent| last=Jones|title='Jennifer's Body' creeps into theaters ... and comics| work=[[USA Today]]| date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=September 27, 2009| url=https://www.usatoday.com/communities/popcandy/post/2009/09/jennifers-body-creeps-into-theaters--and-comics/1}}</ref><ref name="www.atomiccomics.com">{{cite web|title=Radiation Interrogation featuring Jennifer's Body creators Rick Spears, Tim Seeley and Jim Mahfood! |publisher=Atomiccomics.com |date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2009 |url=http://www.atomiccomics.com/Pages/AtomicBlog/tabid/91/EntryID/561/Default.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828020455/http://www.atomiccomics.com/Pages/AtomicBlog/tabid/91/EntryID/561/Default.aspx |archivedate=August 28, 2009 }}</ref>

The novel features less of Jennifer than the film, but does capture her "going in for the kill" several times. It focuses heavily on following her soon-to-be victims and provides information on their personalities not elaborated on in the film so that readers can better conclude whether the boys deserved to be murdered. The novel consists of four chapters, with a prologue and an epilogue, with art provided for each by different artists. Each one follows a different boy and what is happening in his life just before Jennifer kills him.<ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/>

On creating the story, Spears stated, "The best part for me as a writer was to show some events from the movie from a different point of view, sort of like [[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]] for you [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] fans. And with comics we can get into the character's heads in a way that works well in comics and novels more so than in film."<ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/> He stated, "...I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what we see in the movies. All the academics aside, it's also very funny and gore splattered."<ref name=www.atomiccomics.com/>

Spears stated that while writing the stories, the film was still being made and he had not seen any of it at the time. He mainly learned about the characters through the script. "I got to read the screenplay. It was kinda crazy writing characters that were being changed on set and in the editing process. I had to bob and weave to keep up but that was all part of the fun", he said.<ref name="www.atomiccomics.com"/>
