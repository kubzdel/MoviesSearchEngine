Her fear deepens after her colleague, Jong-sook, tells her that 12 years earlier a prisoner transport vehicle caused a traffic accident wherein all the prisoners involved died - and some of the corpses disappeared. Since then, a murder has occurred near the tollgate on February 29th, every four years. Calamity soon follows.
