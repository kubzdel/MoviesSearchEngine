'''''Alone in the Dark''''' is a 2005 Canadian-German-American [[action film|action]] [[horror film]] loosely based on the [[Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare|fourth installment]] of [[Infogrames]]' [[video game]] series of the [[Alone in the Dark|same name]]. Directed by [[Uwe Boll]], the film stars [[Christian Slater]] as supernatural detective Edward Carnby (the main character in the games), and also features a cast of [[Tara Reid]], [[Stephen Dorff]], [[Frank C. Turner]], [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]], [[Will Sanderson]], [[Mike Dopud]], [[Mark Acheson]], [[Darren Shahlavi]], [[Karin Konoval]] and Ed Anders.

The film was a critical and commercial failure, and is widely considered one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. Despite this, a [[Alone in the Dark II (film)|sequel]] was released in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alone_in_the_dark_2/ |title=Alone in the Dark II |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>

==Plot synopsis==
Edward Carnby (Slater) is a [[detective]] who specializes in the [[occult]] and other paranormal subjects. He was apparently the subject of strange experiments when he was a child, leaving him with heightened abilities as well as a "sixth sense" that allows him to sense the paranormal. Throughout the film, we also learn that Carnby used to work for Bureau 713, a secret government organization that seeks to protect the world from paranormal dangers.

In his spare time, Carnby investigates the disappearance of the Abkani, an ancient [[Maya civilization|Mayan]]-like civilization that worshipped demonic creatures from another dimension. Central to the plot are several artifacts un-earthed in 1967 and now on display at the city's Museum of Natural History, at which Carnby's girlfriend Aline (Reid) is the assistant curator. Carnby soon finds himself investigating the very scientist who conducted experiments on him as a child, while working with Aline and former protégé (now rival) Commander Burke, his replacement at Bureau 713, to stop an invasion of the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]]-like demonic creatures who are pouring through a portal opened by the Abkani artifacts.

==Cast==
* [[Christian Slater]] as [[Alone in the Dark|Edward Carnby]]: Raised at an [[orphanage]] under Sister Clara, Carnby lost his memory when he was ten years old. At twenty, he was recruited by Bureau 713, gaining knowledge on the paranormal soon after. His current assignment is investigating his past along with researching the disappearance of the Abkani. Due to the experiments conducted on him as a child, he has the ability to sense paranormal activity and has increased strength and speed, which allow him to perform acrobatic moves that a normal human could not do.
** Dustyn Arthurs as Young Edward
* [[Tara Reid]] as Aline Cedrac, an [[archaeologist]] and museum curator; Edward's girlfriend who knows about the Abkani and their culture.
* [[Stephen Dorff]] as Commander Richard Burke, the Commander of Bureau 713, formerly worked under Carnby's direction.
* [[Frank C. Turner]] as Agent Fischer, the head of the medical unit of Bureau 713; he is one of Carnby's few trusted allies and friends.
* [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] as Professor Lionel Hudgens
* [[Will Sanderson]] as Agent Miles
* [[Mike Dopud]] as Agent Turner; he is killed by Fischer while working on a power generator
* [[Francoise Yip]] as Agent Cheung
* [[Mark Acheson]] as Captain Chernick
* [[Darren Shahlavi]] as John Dillon
* [[Karin Konoval]] as Sister Clara, owner of the orphanage which cared for Edward. In the '80s, she was persuaded by Hudgens to allow experiments on the orphans. She keeps this secret from everyone but is inwardly guilty for her immoral actions.
* Ed Anders as James Pinkerton, a former Agent of Bureau 713 who went missing in action in the 1980s. He and Hudgens were in charge of the investigation of the disappearance of gold-miners at Brutan Goldmine. Pinkerton became an experiment for Hudgens, who attached a Xenos creature to his spine. His abilities included increased awareness, strength, speed and willpower.
* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Cab driver

==Alternate script==
Blair Erickson came up with the first drafts of the script for ''Alone in the Dark''. According to Erickson, Uwe Boll changed the script to be more action packed than a thriller. Erickson stated his disgust and his working relationship towards Boll on [[Somethingawful.com]].

{{quote|The original script took the ''Alone In the Dark'' premise and depicted it as if it were actually based on a true story of a private investigator in the northeastern U.S. whose missing persons cases begin to uncover a disturbing paranormal secret. It was told through the eyes of a writer following Edward Carnby and his co-worker for a novel, and depicted them as real-life [[blue-collar]] folks who never expected to find hideous beings waiting for them in the dark. We tried to stick close to the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] style and the low-tech nature of the original game, always keeping the horror in the shadows so you never saw what was coming for them.

Thankfully Dr. Boll was able to hire his loyal team of hacks to crank out something much better than our crappy story and add in all sorts of terrifying horror movie essentials like opening gateways to alternate dimensions, bimbo blonde archaeologists, sex scenes, mad scientists, slimy dog monsters, special army forces designed to battle slimy CG dog monsters, Tara Reid, "[[The Matrix|Matrix]]" slow-motion gun battles, and car chases. Oh yeah, and a ten-minute opening back story scroll read aloud to the illiterate audience, the only people able to successfully miss all the negative reviews. I mean hell, Boll knows that's where the real scares lie.<ref>{{cite web | last = Erikson | first = Blair | title = Behind the Scenes: Uwe Boll and Uwe Boll's ''Alone in the Dark'' | url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/feature-articles/behind-scenes-uwe.php?page=2 | accessdate = 2007-09-22 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014043913/http://www.somethingawful.com/d/feature-articles/behind-scenes-uwe.php?page=2| archivedate= 14 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>}}

The film was released on VHS and DVD on May 10, 2005. An unrated director's cut was released in Germany, France, and Australia and was #1 on the German DVD market for three weeks.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369226/alternateversions Alternate versions for ''Alone in the Dark'' (2005)]</ref> It was released on DVD in North America on 25 September 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9343|title=Lionsgate Double-Dips Uwe Boll's ''Alone in the Dark''?!|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818194104/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/9343|archivedate=18 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the newest version of the film, the sex scene between Carnby and Aline has been removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=2492|title=Alone in the Dark Comparison: R-Rated, Unrated Director's Cut|publisher=Movie-Censorship.com}}</ref>

==Original film and game tie-in concept==
Originally, the film version of ''[[Alone in the Dark]]'' was to be released with ''[[Alone in the Dark (2008 video game)|Alone in the Dark 5]]'', the fifth title in the series; however, the creators of ''Alone in the Dark'', [[Eden Games]], delayed the game and reworked it entirely from scratch. This appears to be one of the causes for the public backlash from gamers on how the film version of ''Alone in the Dark'' appeared to deviate from the ''Alone in the Dark'' game franchise save for the fact that the film was in some ways a sequel to ''[[Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare]]''. [[Uwe Boll]] stated his disappointment on the [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|region 1]] DVD commentary but also said that Atari had face shots of [[Christian Slater]] for the newest game - ''[[Alone in the Dark (2008 video game)|Alone in the Dark 5]]'', which was released on June 26, 2008.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Alone in the Dark'' grossed $2,834,421 in its opening weekend, ranking at #12; by the end of its run, the film had grossed $10,442,808 and was a [[box office bomb]], considering its $20 million budget.<ref name="mojo">{{mojo title|aloneinthedark|Alone in the Dark}}</ref>

===Critical response===
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
''Alone in the Dark'' received harsh reviews upon its release. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film a rating of 1% based on 120 reviews, and the site's critical consensus reads, "Inept on almost every level, Alone in the Dark may not work as a thriller, but it's good for some head-slapping, incredulous laughter."<ref name="rotten">{{rotten-tomatoes|alone_in_the_dark|Alone in the Dark}}</ref> At [[Metacritic]], it has a score of 9/100, indicating "overwhelming dislike". [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an F grade. Many critics harshly criticized the awful acting, several plot holes, a near complete lack of connection to the video games, and the poor quality of the special effects. Numerous editing mistakes were also highlighted, such as a scene showing a female soldier killed, only for her to lift her head once the camera crew moves away. Several also slammed the long introduction text. Scott Brown of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an F grade, commenting that the film was "so bad its postmodern."<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Brown |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1023947,00.html |title=Alone in the Dark Review &#124; Movie Reviews and News |publisher=EW.com |date=2005-02-02 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>

In one of the film's only positive reviews, Michelle Alexandria of [[Eclipse Magazine]] wrote "''Alone in the Dark'' isn't going to set the world on fire, but it largely succeeds with what it has to work with. Just don't take it seriously and you'll have a fun time."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/alone_in_the_dark/reviews/?sort=fresh |title=Alone in the Dark - Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>
