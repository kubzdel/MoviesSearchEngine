'''''Raaz 3''''' (also known as '''''Raaz 3: The Third Dimension''''') (English: ''Secret 3'') is a [[Bollywood]] [[horror film|horror]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] film directed by [[Vikram Bhatt]], and produced by [[Mahesh Bhatt]] and [[Mukesh Bhatt]].<ref name=Look>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/FIRST-LOOK-Hot-Bipasha-Basu-in-Raaz-3/Article1-895618.aspx |title=FIRST LOOK: Hot Bipasha Basu in Raaz 3 |author=Kavita Awaasthi |publisher=''[[Hindustan Times]]'' |location=Mumbai |date=25 July 2012 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref> The movie features [[Bipasha Basu]] , [[Emraan Hashmi]] and [[Esha Gupta]] as main characters. The film is the third installment in the ''[[Raaz (film series)|Raaz series]]'', being a sequel to ''[[Raaz: The Mystery Continues]]'', which itself was a sequel to ''Raaz'' which starred Bipasha Basu and [[Dino Morea]]. Bipasha Basu who was a part of the first film of the ''Raaz'' series, has made a comeback to the series after opting out of the second film. It was one of the films in a series of quasi-sequels released under the Bhatt Banner including ''[[Raaz: The Mystery Continues]]'', ''[[Murder 2]]'', ''[[Jannat 2]]'', ''[[Jism 2]]'', ''[[1920: Evil Returns]]'', ''[[Murder 3]]'' and ''[[Aashiqui 2]]'', each of which had nothing to do with their respective prequels, but somehow fell into the same genre following a similar story.

The film released on 6 September 2012 to positive reviews while Basu's role received critical acclaim. The film garnered overwhelming box office collections and was declared a "Super Hit" at the box office. It emerged as a major commercial success in India and is the highest-grossing film in the ''Raaz'' trilogy as well as the highest grossing Hindi horror film ever. The film is also the first 3D super hit of India and the second highest-grossing film of [[Vishesh Films]].It was also called a ''3D Blockbuster'' in the Indian media. The film is also currently the highest-grossing film of [[Emraan Hashmi]] and [[Esha Gupta]], beating ''[[Murder 2]]'' and ''[[Jannat 2]]'', respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Plot==
The story revolves around Shanaya ([[Bipasha Basu]]), an actress at the height of her success. She gets offered the best roles and wins all the awards she is nominated for. In addition, she also has a passionate affair with a handsome director named Aditya ([[Emraan Hashmi]]). This all ends when a younger actress, Sanjana ([[Esha Gupta]]) entered the film industry. In place of Shanaya, Sanjana comes into spotlight and begins to snatch away her awards. Suddenly, Shanaya seems forgotten and everybody only wants to work with Sanjana. Soon enough, Shanaya sees her career fading away and her envy slowly becomes craziness. She begins to turn to black magic and makes it her goal in life to destroy Sanjana's career and make her the pain of loss.

She seeks help of her uncle sonu (Sunil Dhariwal), a tantrik who helps her to practice black magic and calls upon an evil entity, Tara Dutt ([[Manish Choudhary]]). She asks him to make Sanjana's life a living hell. Tara agrees to help haunt and torture Sanjana until she becomes suicidal. He asks Shanaya to give her a black poison through a person she trusts. Shanaya seduces Aditya to do it for her and whenever he feels guilty, she makes him accept again. Aditya, whose sympathy for Sanjana has turned into love, leaves Shanaya and refuses to listen her any more. Now Shanaya must work on her own to defeat the power of love.

Somehow, to try to end Aditya and Sanjana's love triangle, Shanaya hatches a plan by befriending Sanjana in order to poison her which Aditya gets suspicious about. At a movie premiere, Shanaya reveals that she actually hid the poison in the chocolate basket she gave to Sanjana earlier. In the bathroom, Sanjana is attacked by a swarm of moths that cause her to strip naked of her dress and run back into the party, thus getting exposed by the paparazzi. Her career is ultimately ruined as the public wrongly believed this to be a deliberate publicity stunt of hers. Aditya takes her to the Hospital and finds out that Shanaya was behind this. In rage, Aditya visits Shanaya's house and damages her things, taking away the last bit of the poisonous water. Agitated, Shanaya seeks Tara Dutt's help again, wanting to kill Sanjana. Tara Dutt tells Shanaya that life and death are in God's hands and that to fight God he'll need her life force. He tells Shanaya that she has to have sex with him to enable Tara to become powerful, to which Shanaya agrees. At the hospital, with the help of the doctor and a saint, Aditya goes into the spirit world to fight Tara Dutt, defeating him and rescuing Sanjana's soul. Back in the real world, Shanaya suffers damage as a result of the fight between Tara Dutt and Aditya and attempts to kill Aditya and Sanjana, only to meet failure. Aditya protects Sanjana from the defeated Shanaya who vows that she will remain a star and commits suicide by pouring acid on her head causing her skin to melt to death. Later, the media puts Sanjana off the hook as they conclude her 'publicity stunt' was a result of a nervous breakdown she had due to a lot of stress. However Aditya turns off the TV, not bothering on that, and focuses more on spending his time with Sanjana.

===Critical reception===
The movie received mixed reviews from critics. Critics pointed out that the only saving grace of the movie was Bipasha.
[[Taran Adarsh]] gave it 3.5/5 stars, commenting "If you are an enthusiast of supernatural thrillers/horror movies, RAAZ 3 should be on your list of 'things to do and watch' this weekend. Go, get ready to be spooked!" Bollywood3 awarded it 3.25/5 stars and wrote," On the whole, Raaz 3 is one movie which has everything going its way. Gritty screenplay, awesome songs and mature performances are sure shot plus points. On the other hand it would be interesting to see how family audience, who love watching popcorn entertainment respond to this film. To those who love edge of the seat horror thrillers, Raaz 3 is one film which is highly recommended. Go buy yourself a ticket and experience the thrill in 3D." Madhureeta Mukherjee of [[The Times Of India]] gave it 3/5 stars while writing, "For all those who want to move over from the Ramsay Bros... go watch 'Raaz 3' in 3D, at your own risk. But don't take it to your grave." Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News gave it 3/5 stars and stated that"Watch 'Raaz 3' for Bipasha and its 3D factor."Independent Bollywood gave 3 out of 5 stars and quoted "Some real original scares and chills this time with memorable performances." IBNLive also gave it 3/5 stars calling it a good horror film.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Subhash K. Jha of IANS gave 2 out of 5 stars saying, "It's Bipasha who holds together the feverish proceedings. She delivers a full-bodied gutsy performance." Udita Jhunjhunwala of businessofcinema.com said, "Bhatt gets the rhythm of the suspense-building wrong, going all too rapidly from grotesque decapitation to a kiss and song scene. It does not help that the acting is also at different levels. Most of the burden to convince rests on Basu's fit shoulders â and she does. You do believe that she is menacing and wicked."
