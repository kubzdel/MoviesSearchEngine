== Synopsis ==
The film follows "She" (Carrie Gemmell), an office woman that initially appears to lead a dull life working at an uninspiring office job. At night, however, she has several surreal fantasies involving sex, blood, and a young woman (Cheryl Singleton) she works with at the office. "She" will occasionally wake up in strange places and is convinced that she's turning into a werewolf - something that she believes is evidenced by her teeth elongating. 

== Cast ==
* Carrie Gemmell as She
* Shauna Henry
* Cheryl Singleton

== Reception ==
DVD Talk praised Gemmell's performance in ''Female Werewolf'' while also stating that the movie would not appeal to all audiences, as it was "a slow moving, deliberate film that is going to appeal to genre nerds of a very specific type, especially those with a soft spot in their hearts for the films of [[Jean Rollin]] and [[Jess Franco]]."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Female Werewolf|url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/69230/female-werewolf/|website = DVD Talk|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}</ref> [[Dread Central]] made similar comments, also comparing it to Franco while also drawing comparisons to [[Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Female Werewolf (2015) - Dread Central|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/107190/female-werewolf-2015/|website = Dread Central|publisher = |accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en-US}}</ref>
