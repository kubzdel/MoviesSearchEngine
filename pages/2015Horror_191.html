== Plot ==
A group of male boarding school cadets, Aki, Rish and Danny, have been assigned with guarding Dhoultham School on the last day of their term. This initially seems like it'd be a boring, routine assignment that will pay off only with experience, until the cadets find that they'll be joined by some female cadets from another school, Verity, Sophie and Meenah. The teens quickly decide to throw an impromptu party, however their fun is soon spoiled when they realize that Dhoultham has been the site of multiple horrific deaths that date back to the 1600s, when many died from the [[Black Death|Black Plague]]. The group soon finds that the school is very haunted and that the ghosts are out for blood. To make matters worse, they're not the only ones trapped in the school as would-be cat burglars Jazz and Shane have broken into the school with the intent to rob it blind.
