{{more plot|date=March 2017}}
Married couple Ed ([[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]]) and Sarah ([[Pollyanna McIntosh]]) have decided that they want to get away from their busy, stressful lives in London and move somewhere more peaceful. They believe that they've found the perfect place in a [[bucolic]] farmhouse in Scotland; however, their real estate agent Flo (Joanne Mitchell) informs them that the land is the site of a gruesome battle between the English and the Scottish. Despite this knowledge and Flo's chilly demeanor, Ed and Sarah choose to purchase the farmhouse and restore the property. Initially all seems well, but on their first night they hear strange sounds in the nearby area and discover that they are not at all welcome in the area.

==Reception==
Critical reception for ''White Settlers'' has been mixed,<ref>{{cite web|title=WHITE SETTLERS (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_settlers/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Newman|first1=Kim|title=White Settlers (review)|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/white-settlers/5076578.article|website=Screen Daily|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Cummings|first1=Chris|title=Frightfest 2014: ‘White Settlers’ Review|url=http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2014/08/23/frightfest-2014-white-settlers-review/|website=Nerdly|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> and the film currently holds a rating of 57% on ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', based on 7 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=White Settlers|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_settlers/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref> ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' and ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' both praised the movie,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harley|first1=Joel|title=WHITE SETTLERS [FRIGHTFEST 2014]|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/latest-reviews-of-movies/9518-white-settlers-frightfest-2014|work=Starburst|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> and ''Bloody Disgusting'' noted "''White Settlers'' couldn’t have been planned more timely. Released against the political debates of independence raging in Scotland, it’s a relevant film. But it also stands on its own as a fierce, atmospheric thriller."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Patrick|title=[FrightFest '14] ‘White Settlers’ Is a Tense and Relevant Thriller|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3310624/frightfest-14-white-settlers-tense-relevant-thriller/|website=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]'' panned the film overall,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalton|first1=Stephen|title='White Settlers': Frightfest Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/white-settlers-frightfest-review-729660|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> and ''The Scotsman'' commented on the film's political and social message, writing "HORROR can be a great genre for engaging with current events. It’s too bad, then, that ''White Settlers'', a film much-hyped as the first independence referendum-themed horror movie, delivers neither decent genre thrills nor provokes much subtextual unease about Scotland’s relationship with England in the run up to the vote."<ref>{{cite web|last1=HARKNESS|first1=ALISTAIR|title=Film reviews: White Settlers : A Dangerous Game|url=http://www.scotsman.com/mobile/what-s-on/film/film-reviews-white-settlers-a-dangerous-game-1-3533464|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>
