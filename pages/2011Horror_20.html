==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}

However, Saulters praises the acting of Edward Furlong and Michael Berryman noting they are the "highlight of the movie".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slackerwood.com/node/2552|title=AFF Review: Below Zero|work=slackerwood.com|last=Saulters|first=Mike|date=2011-11-01|accessdate=2013-04-19}}</ref>  Martin Unsworth of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' rated the film with 8 out of 10 stars and wrote that he expected it to be a routine [[slasher film]], but it turned out to be "fresh and surprising".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/latest-reviews-of-movies/3513-movie-review-below-zero|title=Movie Review: BELOW ZERO|last=Unsworth|first=Martin|work=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|date=2012-09-21|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>
