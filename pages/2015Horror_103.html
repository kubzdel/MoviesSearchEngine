==Plot==
The film opens with Harry Cox ([[Balthazar Getty]]) having sex in a car with his mistress, Lisa ([[Lydia Hearst]]). After Lisa exits the car, his wife Alex ([[Chloë Sevigny]]) calls him and chastises him on the phone. After he hangs up, his throat is slashed, and Lisa is also murdered .

Twelve-year-old Sam is invited to a sleepover at classmate Sofia Cox's mansion in [[Connecticut]]. Sam finds herself embarrassed by her lack of wealth amongst her rich and privileged classmates. Also at the sleepover are Francesca, Ava, and Georgie. Another girl, Cat White, is being driven to the house by her father, Dr. White ([[Timothy Hutton]]); it is established that Cat is suffering psychological problems and has been in trouble for bullying the girls.

The girls engage in a pretend fashion show, incessantly posting photos of themselves on [[social media]] with their [[smart phone]]s. Cat arrives, and Alex allows the girls into her walk-in safe where numerous pieces of jewelry and clothing are stored. She then leaves to go into town for a [[Twelve-step program|twelve-step meeting]].

As the night goes on, the girls, each consumed by their cell phones, begin to fight with one another. Cat instigates a confrontation and taunts Georgie about her weight, and Sofia forces her to leave. Cat storms into the woods, where she attempts to call her father to pick her up. She begins [[Facebook features#Wall|tagging]] Georgie in a stream of cruel photos on [[Facebook]]; the girls collectively decide to lock their cell phones in the safe to avoid Cat's [[cyberbullying]], and Sofia throws the keys to the safe in the house's swimming pool.

After Dr. White receives a frantic voicemail from Cat, he returns to the house and interrogates the girls about his daughter's whereabouts. He tells the girls he is going to press charges. Sam goes to search for Cat in the woods, and finds Sofia's father's car parked, with blood across the windshield. She returns to the house panicked, but the girls don't believe her.

Georgie and Francesca begin to taunt Sofia about her mother's alleged affair with Dr. White, and she leaves. In the woods, Sofia also stumbles upon her father's car, and finds his corpse inside. She calls her mother; Alex answers, believing it to be her husband, and angrily yells into the phone about his cheating and hangs up. Sofia takes a revolver from the car and flees. At the house, Sam stumbles upon Ava's dead body, and is attacked by a masked assailant. She goes to retrieve the safe key from the pool to get the girls' cell phones back.

Georgie has her throat slashed; Francesca is also stabbed to death. Both of their deaths are [[live stream|streamed]] on the internet, and photos of their bodies posted online. Sam retrieves the key and opens the safe, but is attacked again, and locks herself inside. On her phone, she finds photos and video of her friends' murders posted on a social media game by Cat. Dr. White returns to the house, and finds Georgie's body. Sam tells him that Cat has killed Ava and Georgie; Cat emerges and unmasks herself. Believing that Dr. White murdered her father, Sofia shoots him to death. Witnessing this, Cat flees; Sofia then learns that Cat is the murderer.

Sam leaves the house to get help. She encounters Cat on the road, wearing the mask. Alex arrives and witnesses Cat shoot herself in the mouth, killing herself. The film ends with a montage of photos of the murders, followed by a video uploaded by Cat, in which she professes her revenge against the girls, and says that she will "be remembered forever."

==Production==

===Conception===
In February 2014, it was announced that [[Tara Subkoff]] had written and was going to direct a film starring [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Balthazar Getty]], [[Natasha Lyonne]], [[Taryn Manning]], [[Stella Schnabel]], [[Lydia Hearst]], and Annabelle Dexter-Jones. Screenwriter Casey Barnhart was brought in to do an uncredited rewrite before production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/02/chloe-sevigny-timothy-hutton-top-horror-noir-thriller-680608/|title=Chloe Sevigny, Timothy Hutton top '#Horror' Noir Thriller|work=Deadline.com|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=October 10, 2015}}</ref>

In a later interview with ''[[Elle magazine|Elle]]'', Subkoff stated that she was inspired to write the film after a discussion she'd had with one of her friends' daughters, who had been [[cyberbullying|cyberbullied]].<ref name="elle">{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/interviews/a28601/tara-subkoff-horror-interview/|work=Elle|title=EXCLUSIVE: A FIRST LOOK AT TARA SUBKOFF'S MILLENNIAL HORROR FLICK STARRING CHLOË SEVIGNY|date=May 29, 2015|author=Krentcil, Faran|accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref> "[The idea] started because I asked my friend's daughter, "What is horror, to you?" This girl was cyberbullied very badly... Now, I was bullied badly as a kid, but I could always change schools. I could always go home. Now you can't…when bullying follows you home, and there's no escape and no end, to me, that's horror. And to so many girls, that's just life."<ref name="elle"/>

[[Erika M. Anderson|EMA]] composed the score of the film, EMA stated: "Film work and scoring is fun for me because I get to make all this music that wouldn’t necessarily fit on an EMA record. We worked really closely with Tara Subkoff on the music. She definitely always had an opinion on what she liked and what she didn’t. It was my first score, so I’m not sure if all composers end up spending weeks in a room with the director, but that’s how we did it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/ema-shares-amnesia-haze-from-the-soundtrack-to-horror-listen/|title=EMA shares “Amnesia Haze" from the soundtrack to #Horror — listen|publisher=CosequenceOfSound.net|first=Ben|last=Kaye|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref>

''#Horror'' received mixed reviews from the critics. It holds a 45% rating on review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771432133/|title=#Horror (2015)|publisher=RottenTomatoes.com|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film holds a rating of 42 out of 100, based on 7 critics indicating "mixed or average reviews."<ref>{{cite web |title= #Horror Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/horror|publisher=Metacritic.com|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}</ref> 
Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing: "Infusing its generic horror tropes with vaguely satirical aspects, the film doesn't really work on either level. Unintentionally campy (or purposely, it's hard to tell) and marred by ridiculous plotting and dialogue, #Horror is mostly just a horror."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/horror-film-review-842276|title='#Horror': Film Review|publisher=[[TheHollywoodReporter.com]]|first=Frank|last=Scheck|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref> Christine N. Ziemba of ''[[Paste Magazine]]'' gave the film a mixed review, writing: "It’s a familiar trope—the killer in the woods hunting a bunch of school girls left home alone—and so much less terrifying than kids armed with their phones, social media accounts, and snark and spite. Despite the issues with #Horror’s plot and some of the performances, we’re still interested in seeing what Subkoff takes on next. She’s self-assured behind the camera with an eye for detail, and developing a distinctive, sleek style that’s worth a second chance."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/11/horror.html|title=#Horror|publisher=Pastemagazine.com|first=Christine N.|last=Ziemba|date=November 25, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref> Despite mixed and negative reviews, Inkoo Kang of ''[[TheWrap.com]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing: "And yet, “#Horror” undeniably succeeds in its main mission: parodying and scrutinizing the ease with which we capture, recycle, reframe, and desensitize ourselves to even the most horrific images. That makes [[Blingee]] possibly the scariest website out there."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/horror-review-chloe-sevigny-timothy-hutton-balthazar-getty/|title=‘#Horror’ Review: Chloe Sevigny Gets Embroiled in Cyber-Bullying That Escalates|publisher=TheWrap.com|first=Inkoo|last=Kang|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}</ref>
