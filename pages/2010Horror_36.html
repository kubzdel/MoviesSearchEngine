'''''The Crazies''''' is a 2010 American [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Breck Eisner]], with a screenplay by [[Scott Kosar]] and Ray Wright. The film is a [[remake]] of the [[The Crazies (1973 film)|1973 film of the same name]] by [[George A. Romero]], who is an executive producer of the remake. The original film follows two stories, one about the civilians and soldiers in the town and the other following politicians and military leaders away from the town. The remake focuses on a family that lives in the town and has to survive the outbreak.

''The Crazies'' stars [[Timothy Olyphant]] and [[Radha Mitchell]]. The film takes place in the fictional town of Ogden Marsh, [[Pierce County, Iowa|Pierce County]], [[Iowa]], "friendliest place on Earth," whose town water supply is accidentally infected with the "Trixie" [[virus]]. After an [[incubation period]] of 48 hours, this virus gradually transforms the mental state of the infected into that of cold, calculating, depraved, bloodthirsty killers, who then prey on family and neighbors alike. The film was released on February 26, 2010 to positive reviews from critics, and was a modest box office success.

==Plot==
In the town of Ogden Marsh, [[Iowa]], local sheriff David Dutten ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) is enjoying a baseball game when it is interrupted by a crazed local resident entering the outfield with a shotgun. David attempts to dissuade him, but is forced to kill him when he raises his weapon. David and his wife Judy ([[Radha Mitchell]]), the lA community family doctor, has begun to notice another town resident exhibiting bizarre behavior, including lifeless and repetitive speech. The next night a local farmer Judy had seen just that morning locks his wife and son inside their farm house and burns it down, and then "mows the goddamn lawn".

Learning of a pilot's body found in a swamp, David and his deputy Russell Clank ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) investigate it. They discover a military aircraft that crashed into the river a few days before. Suspecting a link between the contaminated water and the residents' bizarre behavior, David attempts to have the town's water supply shut off, but is denied. He does so anyway, knowing it may cost him his job.

Soon after, all communication services are lost in town and David urges his wife to leave and go to her parents' house, but she refuses. Suddenly soldiers arrive to take all residents to quarantine at a high school. Everyone is examined for symptoms of infection. Judy does not pass the examination (later we find out the reason is that she is pregnant) and is separated from David. David escapes evacuation and heads back to his office, encountering Russell. The two head for the school to free Judy. At the school, the infected townspeople breach the perimeter, and the military personnel evacuate, abandoning the civilians. Judy wakes up strapped to a [[gurney]], and helplessly watches as a crazed school director kills quarantined people one by one. David and Russell save her and also find Becca ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), a hospital assistant.

Unable to find a working vehicle, the four make their way out of town on foot. They encounter Becca's boyfriend, Scotty, at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repair an older patrol car in David's garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russell's state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|attack helicopter]] and drive into a car wash for cover. The workers attack the car and drag Becca out with a wrapped hose, breaking her neck. When the rest of the group leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car.

While walking down the road, the group spots a black SUV speeding toward them, which Russell disables with a police [[spike strip]]. The driver, a government employee, reveals the cargo plane contained "Trixie," a "[[Rhabdoviridae]] prototype" [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]]. It was en route to Texas to be destroyed when the plane crashed. Enraged, Russell shoots him and threatens Judy and David. When confronted about his behavior, Russell realizes he is infected and, after being disarmed, begs to go on with Judy and David. At a roadblock, Russel volunteers to distract the soldiers so that Judy and David can sneak past. He calls out the soldiers on their actions and gets killed.

David and Judy arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle, discovering that the military have also executed those who were evacuated. Judy kills an infected while David fights with another infected and burns its body, killing it. They escape in a semi-truck, but as they drive away, a massive explosion destroys Ogden Marsh <!-- NUKE IS NOT SPECIFIED IN MOVIE, PLEASE SEE TALK PAGE --> and causes a shock wave that flips over their vehicle. As the couple walk towards [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]], a view from a military satellite highlights first the couple, then the city, and the words "Initiate containment protocol" appear, signifying a new containment task.

In the credits, Bruce Aune, a real newscaster from [[KCRG-TV]] 9 in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] reports that an explosion originating from the Dakon Pendrill chemical plant started a massive fire in Ogden Marsh. He says a perimeter has been set and civilians are not being allowed into the area. A Trixie-infected individual appears on camera just before the signal is lost.

===Makeup===
[[File:Crazies infectd.png|thumb|right|250px|The final stage of the Trixie disease took three hours in the make-up chair to complete.]]
The makeup for the film was designed by Almost Human Studios, who also did makeup for other horror films such as ''[[Quarantine (2008 film)|Quarantine]]'', ''[[Frankenfish]]'' and ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]''. Director Breck Eisner's first visions of what the infected would look like were zombies. He and the makeup crew made many molds and sketches of what the infected should look like, with deformities and skin hanging off and so forth. Eventually, he grew tired of the "zombie" look which he believed to be too cliché and decided to go for a more realistic "go under the skin," in which the blood vessels would appear to be bursting forth and face and neck muscles and tendons tight and wrought. Eisner described this look as "hyper alive."

The director's one and only rule for the makeup design was that they would have to research in medical books and consult medical professionals for the design of the infected. Lead make-up artist Rob Hall said "If we were to pitch something to Breck, about, if you know, one side of his face should look like this, Breck would immediately want to know what disease it came from, and what version of reality it could be implemented into Trixie. But the most important thing was to make sure it felt ''real''. Make it feel like you could get it, too." The basis of the makeup the crew used was mainly [[rabies]], [[tetanus]] and [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]].

Each "Crazy" design had about 21 separate pieces that took over three hours to apply for the final effect seen in the film. Robert stated the final effect in the film seen was not just the makeup, but the lighting, camera angles, and post-production effects were the main factor. The main theme for the design was "stress." He stated he wanted the "Crazies" to look stressed out. The veins and eyes were the main focus of the design. The contact lenses covered the actors' entire eyes and required eyedrops every five minutes to prevent permanent eye damage.<ref>''The Crazies'' DVD Special Feature(s): "Paranormal Pandemics," "Rob Hall make-up featurette," "Behind-the-scenes with Breck Esiner"</ref>
