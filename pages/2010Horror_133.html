'''''Rammbock''''' (also '''''Rammbock: Berlin Undead''''' and '''''Siege of the Dead''''') is a 2010 German [[horror film]] directed by [[Marvin Kren]], written by Benjamin Hessler, and starring Michael Fuith, [[Theo Trebs]], Anka Graczyk, and [[Emily Cox (actress)|Emily Cox]] as survivors of a rage virus in Berlin.  Besides its native Germany, it was theatrically released in Austria, the UK, and the US.

== Plot ==
Michael, who has recently broken up with Gabi, visits her Berlin apartment to return her keys and hopefully save the relationship. He finds two plumbers there, and they do not know where she is.  As Michael attempts to contact Gabi, a rage virus transforms people into bloodthirsty cannibals, and one of the plumbers attacks Michael.  As Berlin falls into anarchy, Michael and the remaining workman, Harper, barricade themselves in the apartment complex and brace for an attack.  They soon realize that the rage virus can be temporarily subdued by remaining calm or using sedatives.  They also learn that the infected are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]]. The pair uses this weakness to attempt to make contact with the other inhabitants of the apartment complex.  Michael, Harper, and Anita, a resident, attempt to break out of the apartment building and make their way to Gabi, whom Michael believes is in danger.
