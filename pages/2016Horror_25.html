==Synopsis==
The documentary looks at Blackout, an immersive horror experience in which participants willingly take part in a haunted house type event.  The scares are tailored to their individual fears, which they relay to the event coordinators prior to fully entering the show. Acts performed on the participants will differ depending on the scares set up by the Blackout staff.  Performers are allowed to touch participants, unlike most other fright attractions, and participants are given a [[Safeword|safe word]] if they grow too uncomfortable or scared.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/28/10858098/the-blackout-experiments-review-haunted-house-sundance-2016|title=The Blackout Experiments takes you inside the most traumatic haunted house of all time|last=Bishop|first=Bryan|date=2016-01-28|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref>

In the documentary, Fox interviews several of Blackout's repeat customers in order to understand why they continue to return to the event.  He captures their reactions to various frights, and for some, the news that they have attended too many Blackout events and are asked not to return.

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave ''The Blackout Experiments'' a favorable review, writing that it was "well assembled, particularly in the editorial department, and boasts an original score (commingled with the Blackout events’ own sound designs) whose creepy atmospherics and sonic jolts would work very well in a regular fictive horror film."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/reviews/the-blackout-experiments-review-sundance-1201691621/|title=Sundance Film Review: ‘The Blackout Experiments’|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|date=2016-01-30|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-09}}</ref> [[The Verge]] also praised the movie, as they felt that "it’s the subjects of The Blackout Experiments that make the film so compelling, as they struggle with their attraction to the experience, the fear and paranoia it instills in them, and eventually, reach a strange kind of peace and decide to leave it behind."<ref name=":0" />  The LA Times also gave a positive review, stating it was "often chilling and hard to shake" and "should captivate horror fans." <ref>{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Noel|title=Horror documentary 'Blackout Experiments' pushes limits of experience|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-blackout-experiments-review-20160718-snap-story.html|website=LA Times|publisher=LA Times}}</ref>
