==Release==
''Mysterious Island 2'' was released in China on January 26, 2013.<ref name="fba-review" /> It did not have as strong box office returns in China as the original film did grossing only a fifth of the amount that ''Mysterious Island'' did.<ref name="fba-review" />

==Reception==
[[Film Business Asia]] gave the film a score of four out of ten, stating that "as the script abandons any attempt at coherence, and the direction, jazzy camerawork and feverish editing follow suit, the only mystery about this Island is how it ever came to be thrown together in the first place."<ref name="fba-review" />
