== Plot ==
A man knocks on a teenage girl's door, claiming to be in need of directions. When the girl leaves to answer the phone, the man sneaks in and grabs her when she returns. Physically and verbally assaulting the girl, the man drags her into a bedroom by the neck and rapes her. Tracking the killer is obnoxious Channel 5 Action News reporter Roberto Negro, who has been receiving taunting letters from the murderer. The killer and two accomplices (one of them initially reluctant) attack a pregnant housewife, filming themselves pummeling and raping her at gunpoint. When the trio finishes, they shoot the woman and her dog. Roberto reports on the housewife's death, and while the authorities refuse to confirm there is a serial killer on the loose, Roberto is convinced there is.

Spotting a woman having car trouble, the killer and his partners pull up in their van, force her into the vehicle and take her to their hideout. The woman is filmed being abused, raped and stabbed. An envelope containing a knife, a gun and another note is sent to Roberto and the police acquire clues from these items. Another package, this one containing a VHS tape, is dropped off at Roberto's office. The tape is a tribute to the killer, showing two of his fans brutalizing and sexually assaulting a woman. Roberto recognizes one of the [[Copycat crime|copycats]] as a gas station attendant, whom the police arrests. Elsewhere, two men recognize the serial killer when he walks by them on the street and chase him, being joined by several others. The killer is cornered in an alleyway, and beat and stabbed to death. Roberto finds the man's body and kicks it twice before walking away.

''Forced Entry'' was described as "a disturbing piece of hardcore, made by and for some very disturbed people" by Recarts Movies Erotica, which said that while the acting was good and it succeeded in creating physical and sexual tension, it suffered from cheesy effects and editing, inconsistent camerawork, and poor production values.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rame.net/reviews/misc/4302.html|title = Extreme Associates' ''Forced Entry''|last = D|first = Jimmy|publisher = Recarts Movies Erotica|date = 22 March 2002|website = rame.net|accessdate = 27 October 2012}}</ref> Adult Industry News decried ''Forced Entry'' as a borderline [[snuff film]], writing "promoting violence and/or making (or trying to make) rape look sexy is very disturbing" and "movies like this are more than controversial, they are bad for the adult film business".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ainews.com/Archives/Story4518.phtml|title = ''Forced Entry'' - Reviewer Rated...|last = Whett, Cohen|first = Nina, Scott|publisher = Adult Industry News|date = 26 May 2002|website = ainews.com|accessdate = 18 April 2013}}</ref> Academic Eugenie Brinkema has written extensively on the film, its content and its reception in an article called 'Rough Sex'.<ref>Brinkema, Eugenie. 2014. ‘Rough Sex’.
