== Plot ==
At the height of a super-typhoon that could well be the first wave of an impending Apocalypse, five men take refuge in a flooded-in police station and spend the rest of the night with a prisoner who may or may not be the Devil.

== Cast ==
* Victor Neri as Gilberto Pring
* Anthony Falcon as Lukas Manabat
* RK Bagatsing as Gabriel Ragas
* Timothy Mabalot as Nathan Winston Payumo
* Andy Bais as Vic
* [[Joel Lamangan]] as Benito Alano

== Production ==
Writer-director Dayao is a film critic, and ''Violator'' is his directorial debut.  He says the step was natural to him, though he accepts others find it less so.  When casting the film, Dayao consciously cast the actors against type.  All of the actors were his first choices, and they all took the roles that he desired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/supreme/2014/11/15/1391769/supreme-radar-horror-dodo-dayao-watch-out-film-critic-turned-filmmaker.|title=Supreme radar: The horror of Dodo Dayao: Watch out for this film critic-turned-filmmaker.|last=Punongbayan|first=Stefan|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=2014-11-15|accessdate=2016-04-05}}</ref>
