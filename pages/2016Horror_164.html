'''''Yoga Hosers''''' is a 2016 American [[Horror (genre)|horror]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Kevin Smith]]. The film is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Smith's 2014 horror film ''[[Tusk (2014 film)|Tusk]]''. The film stars [[Johnny Depp]] alongside his daughter [[Lily-Rose Depp]] and Smith's daughter [[Harley Quinn Smith]]. The film is the second in Smith's [[True North trilogy|''True North'' trilogy]] and had its world premiere on January 24, 2016, at the [[2016 Sundance Film Festival]]. The film was released on September 2, 2016 by Invincible Pictures.

==Plot==
Colleen Collette and Colleen McKenzie are two average 15-year-old girls that spend their days studying [[yoga]] with their guru, Yogi Bayer, and working an after-school job at a [[Manitoba]] convenience store called Eh-2-Zed. They are also in a cover band called Glamthrax with their 35-year-old friend, Ichabod, on drums. The two are invited to a party by a popular senior, Hunter Calloway, who is the object of Colleen M's affections.

The next day at school, the girls' history teacher informs the class that the [[Nazi Party]] once had an influence in [[Winnipeg]]. Led by the self-proclaimed "Canadian [[FÃ¼hrer]]" [[Adrien Arcand]] and his right-hand-man, Andronicus Arcane, the Canadian Nazis were once a great force of terror. Arcand was later arrested by Federal authorities, but Andronicus Arcane was never found.

Colleen C's father Bob, who owns the Eh-2-Zed, and his girlfriend Tabitha, the store's manager, decide to take a spontaneous trip to [[Niagara Falls]], leaving the girls to run the store on the night of Hunter's party. The Colleens invite Hunter and his friend Gordon Greenleaf to bring the party to the store so that they won't miss out. Colleen M escorts Hunter to the back room at his request, only to discover that Hunter and Gordon are actually [[Satanism|Satanists]] who wish to sacrifice and dismember the Colleens. Before this can occur, an army of little monsters called Bratzis (one-foot-tall Nazis made from [[bratwurst]]) attack and kill Hunter and Gordon. Using their yoga skills, the Colleens fight and defeat the Bratzis, but are soon arrested for the murder of Hunter and Gordon.

Legendary man-hunter Guy LaPointe, who had an [[Tusk (2014 film)|encounter with the Colleens once before]], arrives at the police station to interrogate the girls. Having obtained some of his own evidence of the Bratzis, he believes the girls' testimony and wishes to help them prove their innocence. After sneaking them out of the station and taking them back to the Eh-2-Zed, LaPointe and the Colleens are knocked unconscious by the Bratzis. They are taken to an underground lair beneath the store where they find the Bratzis' master, Andronicus Arcane.

Arcane reveals to LaPointe and the Colleens that he once had dreams of becoming an artist. After having his work ridiculed by various critics, he decided to become a scientist for the Canadian Nazi movement. The Nazis hid him in the underground lair to create a clone army to conquer Canada and the United States. The clones, made from bratwurst and Arcane's DNA, needed to incubate for 100 years before they were fully grown, so Arcane cryogenically froze himself until the time when he and his clones could rise again. This process was interrupted when a power outage at the Eh-2-Zed 70 years later caused Arcane to thaw and the clones' incubation to stop, rendering them just one foot in height. Learning that the Nazi Party had long since been defeated, Arcane began a new mission to kill all critics as revenge for those that poorly reviewed his early work. He reveals he has constructed a ten-foot-tall [[goaltender]] from body parts of the Bratzis' victims to carry out his murderous deeds. This "Goalie Golem" is controlled by the Bratzis who operate it from its insides. No longer wishing to follow Arcane's orders, the Golem kills him and then turns on the Colleens. The Colleens once again use their yoga skills to defeat the Golem and soon after, clear their names.

After being dubbed "Hero Clerks" by the media, the Colleens return to their normal lives and end the film with a cover of "[[O, Canada]]", accompanied on guitar by Guy LaPointe.

==Production==
Smith revealed before the release of ''[[Tusk (2014 film)|Tusk]]'' that he had written a spin-off film called ''Yoga Hosers'', which would feature the cast from ''Tusk''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/kevin-smith-confirms-tusk-spinoff-30411687.html|title=Kevin Smith confirms Tusk spin-off|date=July 7, 2014|work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 9, 2014}}</ref>

The title came from a remark [[Scott Mosier]] made during an early 2014 segment of ''[[SModcast]]'', the [[podcast]] he cohosts with Smith. Smith brought up some fanciful quotes attributed to Simon Metke, an [[Edmonton]] [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] instructor whose home had recently been raided by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP), who recovered [[2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft|an artwork stolen from]] the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] in 2011. Mosier imagined the RCMP saying "Open up, yoga [[hoser]]!" as they knocked on the door. After it became a [[catchphrase]] among the podcast's listeners, Smith announced it would be the title of his next film. The character of Yogi Bayer in the film is also based on descriptions of Metke in the media.<ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story">{{cite news|last=Pruden|first=Jana|title=The Edmonton man who inspired 'Yoga Hoser' arrested for possession of a $1.2-million ancient statue|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/simon-metke-the-man-thrust-into-a-strange-world-of-canadian-art-theft/article34855605/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>

 |quote = If you were to tell me a midnight movie was coming out that was a cross between ''Clueless'', a second-rate ''Gremlins'' knock-off, the 1966 ''Batman'', ''Strange Brew'', and ''Clerks'', I would have said, 'Wow, that sounds great!'

''Yoga Hosers'' received generally negative reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 19%, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 3.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Undisciplined, unfunny, and bereft of evident purpose, ''Yoga Hosers'' represents a particularly grating low point in Kevin Smith's once-promising career."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yoga_hosers/|title=Yoga Hosers (2016)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a rating of 23 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/yoga-hosers|title=Yoga Hosers Reviews|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=September 1, 2016}}</ref>

Justin Chang of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing that "Harley Quinn Smith and especially Lily-Rose Depp have sufficient spunk, spark and chemistry (and they're charming bopping through an end-credits cover of "[[O Canada]]") that you long to see them in a starring vehicle that doesn't look and feel like an on-screen underwear stain. Shot and edited with the sort of willful slovenliness that presumably fits the anything-goes grab-bag effect Smith was going for, ''Yoga Hosers'' looks as though it was probably pretty fun to make, though only the director's hardcore fans and SModcast listeners are likely to find that pleasure in any way infectious."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/yoga-hosers-review-kevin-smith-1201687721/|title=Sundance Film Review: 'Yoga Hosers'|work=Variety|first=Justin|last=Chang|date=January 25, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> John DeFore of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing that "the young leads seem to be having fun even if you aren't, but any acting careers they might go on to will not be the result of this film."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/yoga-hosers-sundance-review-858886|title='Yoga Hosers': Sundance Review|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=John|last=DeFore|date=January 25, 2016|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref>

In an extended review for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in 2017, [[Nathan Rabin]] summed up the film as a "fiasco" blaming the self-indulgence and laziness leading to "Smith combin[ing] what are clearly his two great loves in life: family and making terrible comedies. It's a beautiful thing when a man is able to fuse his personal and professional life this way. It's just a shame the result is borderline unwatchable."<ref name="avc">{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/aboot-2-girls-case-file-81-yoga-hosers-250113 |title=My World of Flops: Aboot 2 Girls Case File #81: ''Yoga Hosers'' |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |author-link=Nathan Rabin |date=March 2, 2017 |work=[[The A.V.
