==Plot==
{{More plot|date=September 2015}}
Since its fight with Pteracuda, Sharktopus is still at large and is lurking in the waters of the [[Dominican Republic]]. An alcoholic boat captain named Ray ([[Casper Van Dien]]) and his sidekick Pablo ([[Jorge Eduardo De Los Santos]]) are enlisted by a voodoo priest named Tiny ([[Tony Almont]]) to obtain the heart of Sharktopus. Meanwhile, Dr. Reinhart ([[Catherine Oxenberg]]), a [[mad scientist]] who studied with Nathan Sands and Rico Symes from the previous two Sharktopus movies, mixes the genes of a [[killer whale]] and a [[gray wolf]] as part of a treatment for an aging Dominican baseball player named Felix Rosa ([[Mario Arturo Hernández]]). The resulting treatment transforms Felix into the [[Akhlut|Whalewolf]] which causes havoc.
