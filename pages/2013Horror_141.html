==Reception==
Critical reception has been mixed.<ref>{{cite web|title=AICN HORROR: Advance review of SMOTHERED! Plus RIGOR MORTIS! BORGMAN! DUST OF WAR! NEVERLAKE! BLOOD WIDOW! VIDEO NASTIES: THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE!

DEAD MAN’S HAND: An Anthology of the Weird West!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/67576#5|publisher=AICN|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> Culture Crypt gave a mixed review for ''Neverlake'', writing "With moderate tweaking to deepen character development, and cleverer motivations to explain some puzzling behavior, “''Neverlake''” might have been a true stunner.  As is, the film is still an effectively eerie blend of classic ghost story and modern medical horror mystery, as well as an impressive first narrative feature from director Riccardo Paoletti.  But a handful of cut corners in the script have “''Neverlake''” coming up just shy of landing a complete knockout punch."<ref>{{cite web|title=NEVERLAKE (review)|url=http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/neverlake-2013|publisher=CultureCrypt|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> HorrorNews.net was also mixed, stating "Not a masterpiece, but worth a look for the sake of its intriguing hint of originality, an unfortunately rare trait in contemporary horror."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Huggins|first1=Caitlin|title=Film Review: Neverlake (2013)|url=http://horrornews.net/86397/neverlake/|publisher=HorrorNews.net|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>
