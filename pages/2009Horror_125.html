==Plot==
A successful [[Wall Street]] trader returns to Britain with her family, but her new home in the countryside contains a disturbing secret. Her understanding of this secret is complicated by her husbands' difficulties and losing his job. In trying to hide this, he uses [[gaslighting]] to trick her into believing she is going insane. 

Her son Thomas's new friend Tobias, has the same name as the little boy who was murdered in the house 30 years ago. This difficult and clever doubling blurs what is truth and what is a delusion.
