*Andrés Couturier as Don Andrés and Rosseau
*Mayté Cordero as Teodora

==Development==
The development of the film took place for three years with the work of 200 people.<ref name="mvs-momias">{{cite news|title=Ánima Estudios estrenará 'La leyenda de las momias de Guanajuato'|url=http://www.mvsnoticias.com/#!/noticias/anima-estudios-estrenara-la-leyenda-de-las-momias-de-guanajuato-736.html|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=MVS Noticas|publisher=MVS Radio|date=27 October 2014}}</ref> The film was produced without the support of the Mexican government, due to not being approved, and the filmmakers had to rely on the support of the state government of [[Guanajuato]], according to producer and Ánima CEO Fernando de Fuentes.<ref name="el-economista-momias">{{cite news|last1=Gutiérrez|first1=Vicente|title=La leyenda de las momias..., animación a la mexicana|url=https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/arteseideas/La-leyenda-de-las-momias...-animacion-a-la-mexicana-20141029-0113.html|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=El Economista|publisher=El Economista|date=29 October 2014}} (in Spanish)</ref> "We were not approved at the time..., but we have the support of Guanajuato, who gave us something. Ánima Estudios had to invest in this much more than in other films, but undoubtedly the stimuli were important to reach [with] what we do today."<ref name="el-economista-momias"/>

Director Alberto Rodríguez detailed the challenges of the development course of the film, mainly focused on recapturing the spirit of the saga's characters and shaping up the franchise. "There were many challenges, a lot of effort and we believe that we are a benchmark in animation and we were forced to break our own standards, as it is difficult to maintain the characters and give them an arc of action for three installments, but we did it," said Rodríguez.<ref name="mvs-momias"/> "The movies and characters are already owned by Ánima Estudios and it has been very difficult, because creating a franchise in a country used to receiving them and not creating them is complicated, but we knew we had to do it," said Fernando de Fuentes.<ref name="el-economista-momias"/>

The film's production was doubted since it took place during the time of the Mexican cinema's decline. "[...]it was a time when everyone was fleeing from the national cinema. But everything has changed and today people see Mexican cinema, because it makes very good products and that is what we want to continue doing," said Fernando de Fuentes.<ref name="el-economista-momias"/> Benny Emmanuel, who plays the protagonist Leo San Juan, also shared his experience, saying that it is his first, not only being in the franchise, but also his first animation role. "[It was...] the first time I participated in this saga[,] and actually this is [my] first thing in dubbing[,] and playing 'Leo' was very nice and the director helped me a lot but it was very funny," said Emmanuel.

===Casting===
The film features the voices of famous Mexican talents, such as Benny Emmanuel (known for his role in ''[[La CQ]]''), Alejandra Muller (also from ''La CQ''), and Eduardo España. While the development course was very challenging to the filmmakers, Rodríguez stated that he was very happy working with the actors involved. Eduardo España, who plays Evaristo, shared his story of working in the film. "I always believe in the actor-director communication and there has to be willingness and openness, but we did very good chemistry with 'El Chino' (director Alberto's nickname) because it gives you a very fatherly negotiation in addition to taking into account [of] good taste and fun[,] and let[s] you flow," he said.<ref name="mvs-momias"/>

===Animation===
The film was produced with [[flash animation]].<ref name="momias-variety"/>
