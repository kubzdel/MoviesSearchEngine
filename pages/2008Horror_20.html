== Plot ==
{{More plot|date=January 2015}}
Jennifer has an over-evolved, hyperactive reproduction system, unsatisfied by all but the most intense intercourse, often resulting in the death of her partners and the birth of mutant babies. Batz has an overgrown, sentient penis, which he tries to tame using strong medication, obscure mechanical contraptions, and copious amounts of porn. When Jennifer meets Batz she becomes obsessed with him, convinced that he is the only man who can satisfy her. When they finally meet, they bond over their social and personal difficulties and lack of sexual fulfillment. However, they must somehow tame Batz' increasingly erratic penis before it can go on a murder spree.

== Cast ==
* [[Charlee Danielson]] as Jennifer
* Anthony Sneed as Batz

== Production ==
Henenlotter and Thorburn wrote the script together. Henenlotter acted as director and Thorburn the producer. The two met when Thorburn recruited Henenlotter to direct a rap video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1199/ |title=The "Basket Case" Returns(?): Interview with Frank Henenlotter (Part 2) |last=Sorrento |first=Matthew |work=[[Film Threat]] |date=2008-06-04 |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012234216/http://www.filmthreat.com/interviews/1199/ |archivedate=2012-10-12 |df= }}</ref>  As opposed to his earlier project that were either canceled or compromised, ''Bad Biology'' allowed Henenlotter and Thorburn complete creative freedom due to Thorburn's investment of funds.  Danielson was dating Thorburn at the time and requested to be cast.  In order to make sure she was committed, Henenlotter tried to scare her off, but he was glad when she stayed with the project, as he said that she was "absolutely perfect" for the part.  Sneed, who was cast as the male lead, found out about the project from a post on [[Craigslist]].  Sneed was initially rejected because of his physique, which Henenlotter did not think was close enough to that of a junkie.  Sneed promised to lose enough weight to look the part. When he followed through and lost 30 pounds in 30 days, Henenlotter was impressed enough to cast him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/14024-exclusive-interview-frank-henenlotter/|title=Exclusive Interview: Frank Henenlotter!|last=Galluzzo|first=Rob|work=[[Shock Till You Drop]]|date=2010-02-08|accessdate=2015-02-11}}</ref>
