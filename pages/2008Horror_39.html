'''''Cloverfield''''' is a 2008 American [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] [[monster movie|monster film]] directed by [[Matt Reeves]], produced by [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Bryan Burk]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. The film stars [[Michael Stahl-David]], [[Odette Yustman]], [[TJ Miller]], [[Jessica Lucas]], [[Lizzy Caplan]] and [[Mike Vogel]]. The plot follows six young [[New York City]] residents fleeing from a [[Clover (creature)|gigantic monster]] and various other smaller creatures that attack the city while they are having a farewell party.

Development began when Abrams started conceptualizing a new monster, taking inspiration from [[Godzilla]] and [[King Kong]]. A scene involving the severed head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] was inspired by the poster for ''[[Escape from New York]]''. The creature was designed by artist [[Neville Page]]. In February 2007, the project was secretly [[greenlight|greenlit]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by Abrams' [[Bad Robot Productions]]. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] that same year. During production, the project went under several working titles, including ''Slusho'', ''Cheese'' and ''Greyshot''. As part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign, a teaser trailer was released ahead of screenings of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' without a title attached. The film's official title was revealed in a second teaser trailer attached to screenings of ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]''. With limited details revealed about the film prior to release, it garnered online speculation, including forums and websites dedicated to uncovering any hidden information about the film. Several tie-ins, including a [[prequel]] [[manga]] series, were released as part of the film's marketing campaign. Websites for Slusho!, a fictional drink, and the fictional company Tagurato were launched as part of the film's mythology. Slusho! was also featured on several other of Abrams' works, such as ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' and ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''.

''Cloverfield'' was released on January 18, 2008 and received positive reviews from film critics. Many praised Reeves' direction and the film's [[cinéma vérité]] style narrative. It earned $170.8 million worldwide at the box office against a $25 million budget. The film eventually served as the first installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], preceding ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'', released on March 11, 2016 and ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', released on February 4, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/next-cloverfield-movie-god-particle-jj-abrams/ |title='God Particle' Is the Next Film in the 'Cloverfield' Universe |publisher=Collider}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. -->
The film is presented as [[Found footage (film technique)|footage]] from a personal camcorder recovered by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the area "formerly known as [[Central Park]]", bearing a disclaimer stating multiple sightings of a case designated "Cloverfield". The tape originally contained footage from the last day Rob and Beth had spent together, which later got overwritten in its majority by the events filmed during the night of Friday, May 22, 2009, the resulting tape alternating between the two.

The first segment is filmed by Rob on the morning of Monday, April 27. Rob and Beth wake up in an apartment after a night together and they make plans to go to [[Coney Island]] that day. The footage cuts to the evening of Friday, May 22, when Jason, Rob's brother, and his girlfriend, Lily, prepare a farewell party for Rob, who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud films testimonials during the party.

After Beth has an argument with Rob and leaves, a supposed earthquake strikes, causing a brief citywide power outage; the local news reports a capsized [[oil tanker]] near [[Liberty Island]]. When the party-goers leave the building, the severed head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] is hurled into the street in front of them. Hud records what appears to be [[Clover (creature)|an enormous creature]] several blocks away collapsing the [[Woolworth Building]]. Later, during the city's evacuation, the creature's gigantic tail destroys the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the [[Army National Guard|Army National Guard's]] [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] attacking the monster. Smaller "parasite" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers.<ref>The creatures are called HSP or "Human-Scale Parasites" in the Blu-ray special investigation mode.</ref>

Rob listens to a phone message from Beth, stating that she is trapped in her apartment at the [[Time Warner Center]] and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and another party-goer, Marlena, venture into [[Midtown Manhattan]] to rescue Beth. By 3:17 am, they get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the [[Spring Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Spring Street]] station, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures during the scuffle; Marlena is bitten by one. Exiting the subway via the [[Lexington Avenue/59th Street (New York City Subway)|59th Street station]], the four come to a command center and field hospital. Marlena reacts to the bite, causing her to bleed from her eyes. She is dragged into a tent, where she apparently explodes. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its "Hammer Down Protocol," which will destroy [[Manhattan]] in an attempt to kill the monster.

The group rescues Beth, impaled on exposed [[rebar]], and the four make their way to the evacuation site at [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they encounter the creature once more. Lily is rushed into a departing [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] bomb the creature. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but then it lunges at the protagonists' helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.

The footage skips to the early morning of Saturday, May 23, less than an hour later. A voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warns that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him.

Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under [[List of arches and bridges in Central Park#Arches|Greyshot Arch]] in Central Park. As [[air raid sirens|sirens]] blare and the bombing starts, Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge crumbles and the camera gets knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath some rubble.<ref>According to the "military intelligence" feature in the Special Investigation Mode of the Blu-ray version, this was the only thing that protected the camera during the Hammer Down protocol</ref> Rob and Beth each proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming while the monster roars.

The footage concludes with Rob and Beth's Coney Island date on April 27. Unnoticed by the characters, an indiscernible object falls from the sky into the ocean. Rob points the camera toward Beth and himself, and zooms in on the latter, who says "I had a good day." At that point, the tape freezes and cuts out.

After the credits, indistinct radio chatter can be heard.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/346501/io9-talks-to-cloverfield-director-matt-reeves |title=io9 Talks To Cloverfield Director Matt Reeves |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |work=io9|access-date=August 1, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref> It can be perceived as "Help us", but when [[Backmasking|played in reverse]], it says "It's still alive".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Vnan8lm00 |title=Cloverfield - The secret at the end of the film !

==Production==

===Development===
[[J. J. Abrams]] thought up a new monster after he and his son visited a toy store in [[Japan]] while promoting ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''. He explained, "We saw all these [[Godzilla]] toys, and I thought, we need our own American monster, and not like [[King Kong]]. I love King Kong. King Kong is adorable. And Godzilla is a charming monster. We love Godzilla. But I wanted something that was just insane and intense."<ref>{{cite news |author=Alex Billington |url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2007/07/26/comic-con-live-paramount-panel-star-trek-indiana-jones-iv-and-more/ |title=Comic-Con Live: Paramount Panel - ''Star Trek'', ''Indiana Jones IV'', and More... |publisher=First Showing |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=September 17, 2007}}</ref><ref name="moviesonlineca">{{cite news |url=http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12553.html |title=JJ Abrams talks ''Cloverfield'' |publisher=Movies Online |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218034125/http://www.moviesonline.ca/movienews_12553.html |archivedate=February 18, 2008}}</ref>

In February 2007, [[Paramount Pictures]] secretly [[Greenlight|greenlit]] ''Cloverfield'', to be produced by Abrams, directed by [[Matt Reeves]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. The project was produced by Abrams' company, [[Bad Robot Productions]].<ref name="rolls">{{cite news |author=Borys Kit |author2=Tatiana Siegel |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id4ef5b33280f855a6076329c1ca10481 |title=Paramount rolls in the ''Cloverfield'' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=July 6, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708103155/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id4ef5b33280f855a6076329c1ca10481 |archivedate=July 8, 2007}}</ref> The visual effects producer was Chantal Feghali.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The severed head of the Statue of Liberty was inspired by the poster of the 1981 film ''[[Escape from New York]]'', which had shown the head lying in the streets in New York. Reeves explained, "It's an incredibly provocative image. And that was the source that inspired producer J. J. Abrams to say, 'Now this would be an interesting idea for a movie'."<ref>{{cite news |author=Scott Collura |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/841/841703p1.html |title=Exclusive: ''Cloverfield'' Director Speaks!

===Title===
The film was initially named ''Cloverfield''. This changed several times throughout production before it was decided that the original title would be used. Matt Reeves explained that the title was changed frequently due to the hype caused by the teaser trailer. "That excitement spread to such a degree that we suddenly couldn't use the name anymore. So we started using all these names like ''Slusho'' and ''Cheese''.<ref name="slashfilm"/> And people always found out what we were doing!" The director said that "Cloverfield" was the government's case designation for the events caused by the monster, comparing the titling to that of the [[Manhattan Project]]. "And it's not a project per se. It's the way that this case has been designated. That's why that is on the trailer, and it becomes clearer in the film. It's how they refer to this phenomenon [or] this case", said the director.<ref>{{cite news |author=Scott Collura |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/841/841636p1.html |title=Exclusive: ''Cloverfield'' Director Speaks! |publisher=IGN |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}</ref> The film's final title, ''Cloverfield'', is the name of the exit Abrams takes to his [[Santa Monica]] office.<ref name="slashfilm">{{cite news |author=Peter Sciretta |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/09/05/what-will-cloverfield1-18-08-be-titled-exclusive-photo/ |title=What will ''Cloverfield/1-18-08'' Be Titled? |publisher=SlashFilm |date=September 5, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Bruce Newman |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_8006739?nclick_check=1 |title=''Cloverfield'': A monster for the MySpace generation |publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> In turn, the road used to lead to the [[Santa Monica Airport]], which originally bore the name Clover Field.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

One final title, ''Greyshot'', was proposed before the movie was officially titled ''Cloverfield''. The name ''Greyshot'' is taken from the archway that the two survivors take shelter under at the end of the movie. Director Reeves said that it was decided not to change the title to ''Greyshot'' because the film was already so well known as ''Cloverfield''.<ref name="DVDComm">{{cite video |title=Cloverfield-(Commentary by director Matt Reeves) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |date=2008}}</ref>

The film received a subtitle in [[Japan]], where it was released as {{nihongo|''Cloverfield/Hakaisha''|クローバーフィールド/HAKAISHA|Kurōbāfīrudo/HAKAISHA}}. The subtitle "[[Destroyer]]" was chosen by Abrams and was translated into Japanese as {{nihongo|Hakaisha|破壊者|lit. "Destroyer"}} by Paramount Japan at his request. The subtitle {{nihongo|Kishin|鬼神|lit. "[[Demon]][ic] God"}} was chosen for the [[manga]] spin-off, ''[[Cloverfield/Kishin]]'', released exclusively in Japan.<ref name="hakiasha">{{cite news |url=http://eiga.com/buzz/20080123/4/ |trans-title=American Blockbuster!

===Casting===
The casting process was carried out in secret, with no script being sent out to candidates. To prevent the leaking of plot information, instead of auditioning the actors with scenes from the film, scripts from Abrams' previous productions were used, such as the television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. Some scenes were also written specifically for the audition process, not intended for use in the film. Despite not being told the premise of the film, Caplan stated that she accepted a role in ''Cloverfield'' solely because she was a fan of the Abrams-produced ''Lost'' (in which her former ''[[Related]]'' co-star [[Kiele Sanchez]] was a recurring character), and her experience of discovering its true nature initially caused her to state that she would not sign on for a film in the future "without knowing full well what it is". She indicated that her character was a sarcastic outsider, and that her role was "physically demanding".<ref name="blackbook">{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/features/comments/lizzy/ |title=Lizzy Caplan: The Meanest Girl in Hollywood? |publisher=[[BlackBook Magazine]] |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=November 16, 2007}}</ref>

===Production===

What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: "''Cloverfield'' very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on [[YouTube]], sending people videos through e-mail&nbsp;– we felt it was very applicable to the way people feel now."<ref name="excl">{{cite news |author=Ryan Rotten |url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=4027 |title=EXCL: ''Cloverfield'' Director Speaks! |publisher=Shock Till You Drop |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007}}</ref>

Several of the filmmakers are heard but not seen in the film. The man yelling "Oh my God!" repeatedly when the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the street is producer [[Bryan Burk]], and director Matt Reeves voiced the whispered radio broadcast at the end of the credits.<ref name="DVDComm"/> After viewing a cut of the film, [[Steven Spielberg]] suggested giving the audience a hint at the fate of the monster during the climax, which resulted in the addition of a countdown overheard on the helicopter's radio and the sounding of [[air raid siren]]s to signal the forthcoming Hammer Down bombing.<ref name="DVDComm"/>

====Style of cinematography====
[[File:Cloverfieldwarning.jpg|thumb|Sign at an AMC theater warning customers by comparing the film to a [[roller coaster]].]]
The film's [[shaky camera]] style of cinematography, dubbed "La Shakily Queasy-Cam" by [[Roger Ebert]], caused some viewers (particularly in darkened movie theaters) to experience [[Motion sickness#Simulation sickness|motion sickness]], including [[nausea]] and a temporary loss of balance. Audience members prone to migraines have cited the film as a trigger. Some theaters showing the film, such as [[AMC Theatres]], provided poster and verbal warnings, informing viewers about the filming style of ''Cloverfield'', while other theatres like [[Pacific Theatres]] just verbally warned customers in detail at the box office about experiencing motion sickness upon viewing the film and what to do if they had to step out and vomit.<ref>{{cite web |work=Koco.com |date=January 22, 2008 |title=Hit Horror Flick Leaving Local Moviegoers Queasy |publisher=Oklahoma City News |url=http://www.koco.com/news/15112533/detail.html |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref>

==Marketing==
Before the film's release, Paramount carried out a [[viral marketing]] campaign to promote the film which included viral tie-ins similar to ''[[Lost Experience]]''.<ref name="burk">{{cite news |author=Tara DiLullo Bennett |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=46450 |title=Producer Talks ''Cloverfield'' |publisher=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=December 17, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220142258/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=46450 |archivedate=December 20, 2007}}</ref> Filmmakers decided to create a teaser trailer that would be a surprise in the light of commonplace media saturation, which they put together during the preparation stage of the production process. The teaser was then used as a basis for the film itself. Paramount Pictures encouraged the teaser to be released without a title attached, and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] approved the move.<ref name="excl"/> As ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' showed high tracking numbers before its release in July 2007, the studio attached the teaser trailer for ''Cloverfield'' that showed the release date of January 18, 2008, but not the title.<ref name="rolls"/> A second trailer was released on November 16, 2007 which was attached to ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'', confirming the title.<ref>{{cite news |author=Olly Richards |title=Exclusive: The New ''Cloverfield'' Trailer |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' |date=November 19, 2007 |url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=21492 |accessdate=November 19, 2007}}</ref>

The studio had kept knowledge of the project secret from the online community, a cited rarity due to the presence of [[Scoop (term)|scoop]]ers that follow upcoming films.

===Pre-release plot speculation===
The sudden appearance of the untitled teaser for ''Cloverfield'', and limited details available in the lead up to the film's release fueled wide media speculation over the film's plot, with many expecting it to be an adaptation of an existing property. Among the possibilities reported on, ''[[The Star Ledger]]'' suggested that the film could be based on the works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], or a new entry in the ''[[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]]'' series.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Rose |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/ledger/index.ssf?/base/entertainment-1/118395545882520.xml&coll=1&thispage=1 |title=Hush-hush project stirs wild speculation |publisher=The Star Ledger |date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=July 9, 2007}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' reported the possibility of a spin-off to Abrams' television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name="guard">{{cite news |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2123609,00.html |title=Trailer for Abrams film lost on moviegoers |publisher=The Guardian |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 26, 2007}}</ref> and a misinterpretation of the trailer's line "It's alive!" as "It's a lion!" led ''[[USA Today]]'' to speculate on a live-action adaptation of Japanese animated series ''[[Voltron]]''.<ref name="merry"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Wolfson |first=Julie |url=http://laist.com/2008/01/09/laist_interview_88.php |title=LAist Interview: Matt Reeves, Director of Cloverfield |publisher=Laist.com |date=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001210105/http://laist.com/2008/01/09/laist_interview_88.php |archivedate=October 1, 2011 |df=}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' and ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' suggested that the film would feature an alien called "''The Parasite''", with that rumored to be the working title of the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/801/801593p1.html |title=It's Alive: 1-18-08 |publisher=IGN |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=July 10, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Chris Tilly |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/features/show-feature/3141/what-is-cloverfield.html |title=What is ''Cloverfield''? |publisher=Time Out |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=July 26, 2007}}</ref> Elsewhere online, ''Slusho'' and ''Colossus'' had been discussed as other possible titles,<ref>{{cite news |author=Greg Morago |title=Our summer of mystery ads |publisher=''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]'' |date=August 22, 2007 |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> as well as ''Monstrous'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cloverfieldnews.com/2007/09/05/was-monstrous-supposed-to-be-the-title/ |title=Was Monstrous Supposed To Be The Title? |publisher=Cloverfieldnews.com |date=September 5, 2007 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}</ref> although this was dispelled by Abrams at ComicCon.<ref name="moviesonlineca"/>

The viral marketing campaign drew the attention of [[alternate reality game]] enthusiasts, hoping to uncover information about the film hidden online. Members of the forums at argn.com and unfiction.com have investigated the background of the film, with the "1-18-08" section at Unfiction generating over 7,700 posts in August 2007.

===Viral tie-ins===
All of the major characters received a personal [[Myspace]] page, all of which are accessible and featuring available photos, though blog posts have been removed.

Unlike most viral marketing campaigns, this one had virtually nothing to do with the film's plot or characters. Instead it focused mainly on the fictional drink Slusho! and the fictional company Tagruato. Puzzle websites containing Lovecraftian elements, such as ''[[Ethan Haas Was Right]]'', were originally reported to be connected to the film.<ref name="guard"/><ref name="usa">{{cite news |author=Anthony Breznican |title=Mystifying trailer transforms marketing |publisher=USA Today |date=July 9, 2007 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-07-08-abrams-trailer_N.htm |accessdate=July 16, 2007}}</ref> On July 9, 2007, producer [[J.

The pictures could also be flipped over by repeatedly and rapidly moving the mouse side to side. Also, if the page was left open for six minutes, the monster's roar could be heard. Eventually, Cloverfield Movie.com was created.<ref name="Slide">{{cite web |title=Research into viral marketing |url=http://www.slideshare.net/afrench14/research-into-viral-marketing |work=SlideShare |publisher=SlideShare Inc |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |author=afrench14 |date=September 14, 2010}}</ref> The site provided both a trailer and a number, 33287, which, when texted from a mobile phone, provided a ringtone of the monster's roar and a wallpaper of a decimated Manhattan. This eventually turns out to be a [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] number (people later received material on ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'', and ''[[The Love Guru]]'').<ref>{{cite news |title=Movie codenamed Cloverfield next blockbuster |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/movie-codenamed-cloverfield/story-fna7dq6e-1111114145680 |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |newspaper=Courier Mail |date=August 11, 2007 |agency=News Queensland}}</ref>

The drink Slusho! served as part of the [[viral marketing]] campaign. The drink had already appeared in producer Abrams' previous creation, the TV series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''.<ref name="iesb">{{cite news |author=Silas Lesnick |url=http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3945&Itemid=99 |title=IESB Exclusive Interview: ''Cloverfield'' Director Matt Reeves! |publisher=IESB |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=December 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217062430/http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3945&Itemid=99 |archivedate=December 17, 2007 |df=}}</ref> Websites for Slusho! and Taguruato were launched to add to the mythology of ''Cloverfield''. The Japanese phone number in the Tagruato website did work, but only played recorded messages. For example, one of the messages was: ''"Thank you for calling Tagruato. Due to high call volumes, your call has been transferred to an automated answering service. There are no updates at this time. After the tone, please leave a message, and one of our associates will find you as soon as possible"''. A building bearing the company logo for Tagruato can also be seen in the TV spot{{clarify|date=February 2016}} of the 2009 [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'']] film, and [[Uhura]] orders a Slusho! during the bar scene.<ref name="burk"/> When ''Cloverfield'' was hosted at Comic-Con 2007, gray Slusho!

A cup of Slusho! appears briefly in ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', and it has also appeared in [[Fringe (TV Series)|''Fringe'']] and [[Heroes (TV Series)|''Heroes'']]. A Slusho! [[bobblehead]] figure also appears shaking in ''The Cloverfield Paradox'' trailer and film.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Producer Burk explained the viral tie-in, "It was all done in conjunction with the studio... The whole experience in making this movie is very reminiscent of how we did [[Lost Experience|''Lost'']]."<ref name="burk"/> Director  Reeves described Slusho! as "part of the involved connectivity" with Abrams' ''Alias'' and that the drink represented a "meta-story" for ''Cloverfield''. The director explained, "It's almost like tentacles that grow out of the film and lead, also, to the ideas in the film. And there's this weird way where you can go see the movie and it's one experience... But there's also this other place where you can get engaged where there's this other sort of aspect for all those people who are into that. All the stories kind of bounce off one another and inform each other. But, at the end of the day, this movie stands on its own to be a movie.... The Internet sort of stories and connections and clues are, in a way, a prism and they're another way of looking at the same thing. To us, it's just another exciting aspect of the storytelling."<ref name="iesb"/>

Due to its presentation as footage from a consumer digital recorder, ''Cloverfield'' has no [[film score]], with the exception of the composition "Roar! (''Cloverfield'' Overture)" by [[Michael Giacchino]] that plays over the end credits. Similarities between "Roar!" and the music of ''Godzilla'' composer [[Akira Ifukube]] have been noted, and it has been suggested that Giacchino's overture is a tribute to Ifukube's work,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.syracusenewtimes.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1563&Itemid=88 |title=''Cloverfield'' review |publisher=[[Syracuse New Times]] |date=January 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/36217 |title=ScoreKeeper Has News About The Release Of Michael Giacchino's CLOVERFIELD Overture!! |publisher=Ain't it Cool News |date=March 2008 |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> which was confirmed by [[Matt Reeves]] in the DVD's commentary track.<ref name="DVDComm"/> The sound track was supervised by William Files<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0276877/ |title=Will Files |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> and Douglas Murray<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/name/nm0614924/ |title=Douglas Murray (III) |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=June 11, 2009}}</ref> at [[Skywalker Sound]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

<!-- Please note, when updating Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic ratings, you should also update the "accessdate" field within the citation tags to reflect the date on which you have updated them. -->
First publicized in a teaser trailer in screenings of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', the film was released on January 17 in [[New Zealand]], [[Russia]] and [[Australia]]; January 18 in North America; January 24 in [[South Korea]]; January 25 in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]; January 31 in Germany; and February 1 in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy. In Japan, the film was released on April 5.

===Home media===
The [[DVD]] was released on April 22, 2008, in two versions: the standard single-disc edition and an exclusive "[[steel]]-book" special edition that was sold at [[Suncoast Motion Picture Company|Suncoast]] and [[F.y.e.|FYE]] retailers in the US and [[Future Shop]] in Canada. Other store exclusives include an exclusive bonus disc titled "T.J. Miller's Video Diary" with the DVD at all [[Best Buy]] retailers, an exclusive mix CD titled "Rob's Goin' to Japan Party Mix" with the DVD at all [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Wal-Mart]] retailers and an exclusive [[ringtone]] with the DVD at all [[Kmart]] and [[Sears]] retailers. [[Borders Group|Borders]] also has an exclusive booklet encased with their DVD.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD was released on June 9 in both one-disc and two-disc editions. The limited steel-book edition is only available from [[HMV]], while [[Play.com]] offers exclusive cover artwork. The HMV-exclusive steel-book contains two discs.

The DVD includes two [[alternative ending]]s, which vary only slightly. The first alternative ending shows Rob and Beth exiting the [[Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue]] station instead of on the Ferris wheel and features different sirens in the background as Rob talks to the camera. In the second alternative ending, just after the final explosion, Beth can be heard screaming "Rob!", followed by a very brief clip of an unknown person looking at the camera (in the commentary, Reeves said that it was one of the crew members) and brushing rubble off the lens. The film then ends with the original final clip of Rob and Beth on their [[Coney Island]] date recording themselves on the Ferris Wheel as the camera tape runs out, with two differences: there is no [[timestamp]] in the lower left-hand corner of the screen, and there is an additional beeping tone indicating the end of the tape.<ref>{{cite video |title=Cloverfield Special Features&nbsp;– Alternative Endings |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |date=April 2008}}</ref>

===Critical reception===
Critical reception to ''Cloverfield'' was generally positive. On the review aggregate website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 77% "Certified Fresh" approval rating based on 202 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's consensus reads, "A sort of ''[[The Blair Witch Project|Blair Witch Project]]'' crossed with ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', ''Cloverfield'' is economically paced, stylistically clever, and filled with scares".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloverfield/ |title=''Cloverfield''&nbsp;– Movie Reviews |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 29, 2011}}</ref> According to [[Metacritic]], the film has received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 64, based on 37 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/cloverfield |title=''Cloverfield'' (2008): Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=April 27, 2008}}</ref>

Marc Savlov of ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'' called the film "the most intense and original creature feature I've seen in my adult moviegoing life [...] a pure-blood, grade A, exhilarating monster movie." He cites [[Matt Reeves]]' direction, the "whip-smart, stylistically invisible" script and the "nearly [[subconscious]] evocation of our current paranoid, [[terrorism|terror]]-phobic times" as the keys to the film's success, saying that telling the story through the lens of one character's camera "works fantastically well".<ref>{{cite news |title=''Cloverfield'' |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A581461 |author=Marc Savlov |publisher=The Austin Chronicle |date=January 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> Michael Rechtshaffen of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it "chillingly effective", generally praising the effects and the film's "claustrophobic intensity".

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film an "old-fashioned monster movie dressed up in trendy new threads", praising the special effects, "[[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude" and "post-9/11 anxiety overlay", but said, "In the end, [it's] not much different from all the marauding creature features that have come before it".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935799.html |title=''Cloverfield'' review |publisher=''Variety'' |author=Todd McCarthy |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref> Scott Foundas of ''[[LA Weekly]]'' was critical of the film's use of scenes reminiscent of the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]] and called it "cheap and opportunistic". He suggested that the film was engaging in "stealth" attempts at social commentary and compared this unfavorably to the films of [[Don Siegel]], [[George A.

She concludes that the film "works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose [[destiny|fates]] are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt."<ref name="ManohlaDargis"/> [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[Salon.com]]'' calls the film "badly constructed, humorless and emotionally sadistic", and sums up by saying that the film "takes the [[psychological trauma|trauma]] of 9/11 and turns it into just another random spectacle at which to point and shoot".<ref>{{cite news |author=Stephanie Zacharek |url=http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2008/01/18/cloverfield/ |title=''Cloverfield'': Do we really need the horror of 9/11 to be repackaged and presented to us as an amusement-park ride? |publisher=Salon.com |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 18, 2008}}</ref> Michael Phillips of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' warned that the viewer may feel "queasy" at the references to September 11, but that "other sequences [...] carry a real jolt" and that such tactics were "crude, but undeniably gripping".

Some critics also pointed out the similarity to the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'']] video game series, in particular the "Ant-lion" monsters from ''Half-Life 2'', and the constant first-person perspective.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/feb/14/cloverfieldishalflife |title=Cloverfield is Half-Life |publisher=The Guardian |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref>

==Sequels==
At the ''Cloverfield'' premiere, director Matt Reeves talked about possibilities of what a sequel will look like if the film succeeds.<ref>{{cite news |author=SpookyDan |url=http://www.fearnet.com/MCNewsDetailPage.aspx?catid=30&mid=12649 |title=Cloverfield Sequel News |publisher=[[Fearnet]] |date=January 19, 2008 |accessdate=January 19, 2008}}</ref> According to Reeves:

{{quote|While we were on set making the film we talked about the possibilities and directions of how a sequel can go. The fun of this movie was that it might not have been the only movie being made that night, there might be another movie! In today's day and age of people filming their lives on their camera phones and [[Handycam]]s, uploading it to [[YouTube]]... That was kind of exciting thinking about that.<ref>{{cite news |author=SpookyDan |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10927 |title=''Cloverfield'' Sequel Talk, Violent Plans! |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308181518/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10927 |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df=}}</ref>}}

In another interview, Reeves stated:

{{quote|There's a moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, and there was a guy filming something on the side of the bridge, and Hud sees him filming and he turns over and he sees the ship that's been capsized and sees the headless Statue of Liberty, and then he turns back and this guy's briefly filming him. In my mind that was two movies intersecting for a brief moment, and I thought there was something interesting in the idea that this incident happened and there are so many different points of view, and there are several different movies at least happening that evening and we just saw one piece of another.<ref name="merry"/>}}

Reeves also pointed out that the final scene on Coney Island shows something falling into the ocean in the background without an explanation. This may have been either the satellite owned by the fictional Japanese media company, Tagruato, or the creature itself. A company news piece on the Tagruato website mentions that a piece of the Japanese Government's ChimpanzII satellite fell off into the Atlantic. Producers Bryan Burk and J. J. Abrams also revealed their thoughts on possible sequels to ''Entertainment Weekly''. According to Burk, "The creative team has fleshed out an entire backstory which, if we're lucky, we might get to explore in future films". Abrams stated that he does not want to rush into the development of the sequel merely because the first film has been a success; he explained that he would rather create a sequel that is true to the previous film.<ref name="EWsequel">{{cite news |author=SpookyDan |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10991 |title=''Cloverfield'' Monster Has History, More Sequel Talk! |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 27, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218204747/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/10991/ |archivedate=February 18, 2014 |df=}}</ref>

At the end of January 2008, Reeves entered early talks with Paramount to direct a sequel, which would likely be filmed before Reeves's other project, ''The Invisible Woman''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979910.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Paramount sows ''Cloverfield'' sequel |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |quote=There's a good chance the sequel will be Reeves' next film, in which case he will direct 'The Invisible Woman' afterward. 'Woman' is a Hitchcock-style thriller}}</ref> Reeves said:

{{quote|The idea of doing something so differently is exhilarating. We hope that it created a movie experience that is different. The thing about doing a sequel is that I think we all really feel protective of that experience. The key here will be if we can find something that is compelling enough and that is different enough for us to do, then it will probably be worth doing. Obviously it also depends on how ''Cloverfield'' does worldwide and all of those things too, but really, for us creatively, we just want to find something that would be another challenge.<ref>{{cite news |author=Orlando Parfitt |title=Matt Reeves Clarifies ''Cloverfield'' Sequel Status |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=February 1, 2008 |url=http://uk.beta.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloverfield/news/1706543/ |accessdate=February 1, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416144348/http://uk.beta.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloverfield/news/1706543/ |archivedate=April 16, 2008 |df=}}</ref>}}

In September 2008, when asked by [[CraveOnline]] what the current status is on ''Cloverfield 2'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Gossip |first=Latin |url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/tv/article/jj-abrams-is-on-the-fringe-70775 |title=J.J Abrams is on the Fringe |publisher=CraveOnline.com |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225142147/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/tv/article/jj-abrams-is-on-the-fringe-70775 |archivedate=February 25, 2011 |df=}}</ref> Abrams stated that at this point, they were still discussing it; however, he still feels reluctant to work on a sequel. In the same interview, Abrams said that they were working on something that "could be kind of cool." When asked if it would take place in a different location, Abrams replied by saying that "it would be a totally different kind of thing but it's too early to talk about."<ref>{{cite web |last=Moody |first=Mike |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a196792/jj-abrams-talks-cloverfield-sequel.html |title=J.J.

The film ''[[Super 8 (2011 film)|Super 8]]'' was initially speculated to be either a sequel or prequel to ''Cloverfield'',<ref>{{cite web |title=We've Got Details on J.J.

In January 2011, horror film fan site BloodyDisgusting.com stated that a ''Cloverfield'' sequel may in fact never happen. They talked to director Reeves and he said that if he can ever get the time to sit down and talk with Drew Goddard and J. J. Abrams about sequel possibilities they will certainly make a sequel, but due to all three's busy schedules Reeves does not see this happening any time soon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/23210 |title=Matt Reeves 'Cloverfield 2' Update: It May Never Happen |author=Chris Eggertsen |publisher=Bloody Disgusting |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}</ref> In a 2011 interview, Matt Reeves gave an update on the status of ''Cloverfield 2'', saying:

{{quote|Getting the right idea together has been taking a long time. &nbsp;... You are going to see it – we just don't know when [laughs]&nbsp;... At the moment we are talking about the story quite a lot. Drew Goddard, who wrote the original, is going to pen the sequel and JJ Abrams is very much involved.&nbsp;... However, the three of us have been so busy that getting the right idea together has been taking a long time.}}

When asked if the sequel will be shot in real time, Reeves stated, "You see, that's a difficult part: we want it to be shot like the first but how can you continue that idea successfully for a second time?&nbsp;... We have a lot of affection for the original and the sequel can't just be the same thing. But that is tricky when you need to have a monster destroying stuff once again."<ref name=TFMRInt>{{cite web |title=Matt Reeves talks Cloverfield 2 |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/matt-reeves-talks-cloverfield-2 |publisher=Total film |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |date=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

In a 2012 interview, screenwriter Goddard gave an update saying, "I'm in, I'm ready to do it...someone call J. J. and tell him to get moving, but because Matt and J. J. and I have been fortunate enough to be busy, it's hard syncing our schedules up. We're all very passionate about returning to that world." When asked if an idea is on paper, he responded, "If you asked each of us what we wanted to do, you'll get three different answers, which is how the first film was. The aesthetic of ''Cloverfield'' benefits from that. Three voices pulling it. Look, nothing would make me happier than to get the three of us in the room to get started."<ref>{{cite web |title=A Cloverfield 2 Update From Drew Goddard |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=87769 |work=Comingsoon.net |accessdate=August 26, 2012 |author=ShockTillYouDrop.com |date=March 7, 2012}}</ref> In a later interview in April of that same year, Goddard said:

{{quote|We didn't set out to make a franchise, we set out to make a good movie. But I love that world and that universe, so if there was an idea that excited us enough, and we felt like there was a reason to do it, we would do it. The nice thing about when you work with a guy like J.J., and the power he gets, the studio's not going to force him to do anything. And he has been able to say, we'll do it when we're ready. We're not going to just do it because it will help your bottom line, we're going to do it because there's an idea that excites us. And so that's informed our discussions. We don't feel like we have to, so it's like 'Can we come up with something that excites us enough to do it?'<ref>{{cite web |title=Sequel Bits: James Cameron Wants More T-800 in ''Terminator 5'', Plus: ''Mission: Impossible 5'', ''Cloverfield 2'', ''Grown-Ups 2'', ''Star Trek'' Video Game |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/sequel-bits-james-cameron-t800-terminator-5-mission-impossible-5-cloverfield-2-grownups-2-star-trek-video-game/ |work=/ Film |publisher=/FILM |accessdate=26 August 2012 |author=Angie Han |date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>}}

During an interview with Abrams to promote ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing ''Cloverfield 2'', but the release of movies such as ''[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'' led them to abandon them as they found the concept of [[Kaiju]] movies played out. However, Abrams also suggested that he has thought of something that if they are lucky enough to get it made "could be really cool that [it] connects some stories" in a future film, even teasing a larger ''Cloverfield'' universe.<ref name="fandango"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/25/cloverfield-jj-abrams-third-movie |title=Cloverfield: J.J.
