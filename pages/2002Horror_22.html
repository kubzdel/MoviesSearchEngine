'''''Darkness''''' is a 2002 Spanish-American [[horror film]] directed by [[Jaume Balagueró]] and starring [[Anna Paquin]], [[Lena Olin]], [[Iain Glen]], [[Giancarlo Giannini]] and [[Fele Martínez]]. The film was produced by Julio Fernández and [[Brian Yuzna]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UCCkhsztnYgC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=brian+yuzna+darkness+2004&source=bl&ots=3UbfiwDVSR&sig=uzsBIAMp_jO6u6lHsn7xqxUM4UA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBmoVChMI1Zj6zd-dyAIViVU-Ch0nqQAP#v=onepage&q=brian%20yuzna%20darkness%202004&f=false|title=Screen World: 2005 Film Annual|date=2005|editors=Monush, Barry; Willis, John}}</ref> The film's plot follows an American family who move into a house in the Spanish countryside, where six children disappeared during an [[occult]] [[ritual]] forty years before; the teenage daughter and young son of the family are subjected to increasing disturbances in the house.

The film premiered in [[Spain]] on 3 October 2002, and was released in theaters across the country eight days later, on 11 October. It was sold to [[Miramax Films]] for American distribution in 2003, but ended up being put on hiatus for over a year; it was eventually released in [[United States]] theaters in an edited, [[PG-13]]-rated cut, on 25 December 2004.

==Plot==
Forty years after an unfinished [[occult]] [[ritual]] resulted in the disappearance of six young children, an American family has moved into a never-before inhabited house in Spain. The mother, Maria (Olin), wants to get the place in order, while the father, Mark (Glen), goes to work, and their children, teenager Regina (Paquin) and her younger brother Paul (Enquist), try to settle into their daily routines.

It helps that Mark's doctor-father, Albert Rua (Giannini) has furnished them with their residence and is nearby, especially when Mark begins to suffer from seizures again due to the progression of his [[Huntington's disease]], which also causes him to become increasingly mentally unstable. Regina is not only worried about him, but also Paul who is now scared of the dark for the first time. The young boy has reason for that, however, as there seems to be some sort of supernatural entity beneath his bed. Furthermore, there are instances when ghostly figures of children are seen standing in the shadow and darkness, watching the family.

As Paul becomes more scared and their father continues to mentally deteriorate, Regina eventually figures out it must have something to do with their home where the power is lost every day. With the help of her new friend, Carlos (Martinez), the two eventually meet the man, Villalobos (Reixach), who designed the house, and learn that it was built for a supernatural ritual requiring the [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]] of seven children (each sacrificed by "hands that love them") to coincide with an [[eclipse]] that only occurs every forty years. With the next one quickly approaching, and now armed with the knowledge that the earlier occult ritual needs one more death to be completed, Regina races to make sure that Paul is not the final victim. 

Stopping first at her grandfather Albert's house to warn him as well, Regina finds out that her grandfather is, in fact, a member of the cult which has been performing these [[Satanism|satanic]] rituals. Her grandfather explains that in the ritual forty years ago, there actually ''were'' seven children in the original ritual, the seventh child being none other than Regina's father, Mark. Albert did not sacrifice his son because at the last minute he realized that he did ''not'' love Mark. Waiting 40 years he has brought Mark and his family to the house with the intention of completing the ritual during this eclipse. Regina also discovers the target is not Paul but still Mark, who is to be sacrificed by "hands that love him." 

Armed with this knowledge, Regina races back to her home to find her father in the midst of another attack, choking on pills as the eclipse begins. Maria tries to perform a [[tracheotomy]] on him, but is unable to bring herself to make the cut. Regina does instead, but Mark bleeds out and dies when the supernatural forces within the house hide the tube needed to complete the procedure. Since Regina genuinely loved Mark, the ritual is finally complete. The darkness then takes the form of Regina and Paul, convincing their mother to turn off the lights. The darkness kills Maria, and then takes the form of Regina's friend Carlos, who picks them up in his car; shortly after they leave, the real Carlos arrives at the house, and is likely killed. The movie ends as Carlos' [[doppelgänger]] drives Regina and Paul into a dark tunnel, implying their doom.

''[[The New York Times]]'' said: "''Darkness'', which crept into theaters nationwide on Christmas Day, tries to spook holiday revelers with a guessing game about which member of a handsome American family, relocated to Spain, will kill another. But the real mystery is why such a mangled film was not junked altogether."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/27/movies/a-mansion-in-spain-where-mainly-evil-reigns.html|work=The New York Times|title=A Mansion in Spain Where Mainly Evil Reigns|author=Martel, Ned|date=27 December 2004|accessdate=30 September 2015}}</ref> [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said the film is "a horror movie so vague about the nightmare it’s spinning, it seems scared of its own shadows... ''Darkness'' was clearly tossed together like salad in the editing room, since it’s little more than the sum of its unshocking shock cuts."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2005/01/05/darkness|work=Entertainment Weekly|author=Gleiberman, Owen|date=5 January 2005|accessdate=30 September 2015|title=Darkness}}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' also gave the film a middling review, saying "Moments hint at a metaphoric statement on child abuse, but the film proves mainly to be a commentary on poor electrical wiring."<ref>{{cite web|title=Darkness|work=The Village Voice|date=28 December 2004|accessdate=30 September 2015|author=Blaylock, David}}</ref>

''[[Variety magazine|Variety]]'' praised the film's cinematography, but criticized its script: "Although director Balaguero displays a talent for spooky visuals and creating an atmosphere of quietly simmering tension, his screenplay (co-written by Fernando de Felipe) is a compendium of barely connected scenes that ultimately lapse into incoherence."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2004/film/markets-festivals/darkness-1200528952/|title=Review: 'Darkness'|author=Scheck, Frank|date=26 December 2004|accessdate=30 September 2015|work=Variety}}</ref>
