==Plot==
John and Samantha Harris, newlyweds who've just suffered a miscarriage, seek to start their already crumbling marriage somewhere outside of New York City. John, an alcoholic suffering from PTSD, struggles to cope. Their drastic age difference causes more tension. Yet, when he is relocated by his Land Development firm to a small town deep within the Appalachian Mountains in order to oversea the development of a Casino, it seems like the perfect opportunity for the couple. Warned that there may be some anger and resentment from the townsfolk, the Newlyweds proceed into the heart of Appalachia with healthy optimism. It doesn't take long until things begin to feel sinister towards the couple. And soon, a slew of harrowing and terrifying events begin to take place within their new home. Soon, it becomes evident that not only are they not wanted, but they have found themselves wrapped up within a nightmarish tapestry of pure evil that lurks within the underbelly of small town America.<ref name="official"/>

==Production==
The film was self-financed by director [[Courtney Fathom Sell]] and actor/co-producer Marc Slanger. Additional investors were brought on board near completion. Shot on location in [[Frostburg]] [[Maryland]], New York City, [[Marion, Massachusetts]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Mattapoisett]] [[Massachusetts]], [[principal photography]] wrapped in late 2016. Mainly known for his [[DIY]] [[independent films]], ''Don't Let the Devil in'' was Sell's first budgeted feature. The film mixes recognizable elements from popular [[giallo]] films as well as numerous [[exploitation films]] with Sell stating that he was inspired by films such as ''[[Race with the Devil]]'', ''[[All the Colors of the Dark]]'', ''[[Dellamorte Dellamore]]'' and ''Morbo''. The style of the film has been compared to early works of [[Dario Argento]]. The film was made with a close knit group of friends and family, as lead actress Jordan Lewis was one of Sell's close friends long before the film began production and [[Cinematographer]] Brian Slanger is main actor Marc Slanger's brother. Additionally, ''Don't Let the Devil in'' was based on a short film Sell and Slanger made years earlier entitled ''House on the Edge of Hell'' which was shot on a Flip Cam for 27 dollars.<ref name="facets1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/dont-let-devil-film-review/ |title=Don'T Let The Devil In: Film Review - The Horror Entertainment Magazine |publisher=Screamhorrormag.com |date= |accessdate=2018-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/articles/courtneyfathomsell2(5-17).shtml |title=(re)Search my Trash |publisher=Search my Trash |date= |accessdate=2018-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Posted at 12:05h |url=http://crypticrock.com/dont-let-devil-movie-review/ |title=Don't Let The Devil In (Movie Review) |publisher=Cryptic Rock |date=2017-10-04 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}</ref>
