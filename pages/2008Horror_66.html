'''''Edges of Darkness''''' is a 2008 American [[direct to video]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Jason Horton]] and Blaine Cade. The plot is about three interconnected tales of terror set against the backdrop of a [[zombie apocalypse]].

== Plot ==
''Edges of Darkness'' tells the tales of three groups of survivors held up in an apartment complex during a zombie apocalypse. With their food supply dwindling, a vampire couple kidnaps a young girl. They intend to bleed her slowly to survive, but things don't go exactly as planned. Dean, an obsessed horror writer is holed up with his neglected wife, Dana. Dean keeps his sanity by burying himself in his writing. He installs a new processor to run his computer on their limited generator power, but soon finds out there's a high price to pay. Heather, a survival nut, rescues a young mother and her son from a horde of zombies. She takes them back to the complex. However, she soon discovers the mother and son are on the run from a group of renegade priests hellbent on destroying the boy.<ref>[http://www.fangoria.com/home/indie-frights/4383-edges-of-darkness-director-opens-his-trap.html EDGES OF DARKNESS director opens his TRAP]</ref>

== Reception ==
Reviews of the video were mixed. Beyondhollywood.com stated in its review, "[''Edges of Darkness'' is] not really anything above a B-level, straight-to-video product...Low budget films aren't usually known for their award-winning dialogue or fine acting, and ''Edges of Darkness'' conforms to the standard. The dialogue never feels "real," and the acting is pretty wooden. That said, I can see several of these actors advancing in their careers."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/edges-of-darkness-2008-movie-review/|title=Edges of Darkness (2008) Movie Review|date=May 26, 2008 |work=beyondhollywood.com|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> Mike Phalin of [[Dread Central]] was more positive; he rated ''Edges of Darkness'' 3 out of 5 stars and said, "When thinking back on ''Edges of Darkness'', the positives far outweigh the bad. The [[independent film]] market is flooded with flops that don't try in the least to break new ground, but Jason Horton and his crew created something that breathes life into a tired and clich√©d subgenre. ''Edges of Darkness'' is certainly an anthology that should be expanded as it employs many creative ideas and a cast of memorable characters."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/edges-darkness-2008|title=Edges of Darkness (2008)|last=Phalin|first=Mike |work=[[Dread Central]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> [[Peter Dendle]] called the stories "thin and unconnected" though an improvement over ''[[Rise of the Undead]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia: 2000-2010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland Publishing]]|year=2012|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DG6rK0PE2vIC&pg=PA88|isbn=9780786492886}}</ref>
