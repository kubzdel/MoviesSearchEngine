==Plot==
Jeanne and Paul are a wealthy couple who lost their son, Joshua, in the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Boxing Day Christmas tsunami of 2004]]. Six months later, having stayed over in Thailand, they view a film at an orphanage fund-raiser made by Kimberly Park,
just back from the Andaman Coast, of Moken and Salone natives in the [[Tanintharyi Region|South Tanintharyi division]]. A restricted area only accessible by boats through a triad of Thakin Gao who has military ties that smuggles girls to bars in [[Myanmar]]. Jeanne sees a vague figure in the distance she believes to be Josh. Discouraged by Jeanne's lead, Paul gives in to contacting the triad's leader Thakin Gao and hiring one of his boats for an exorbitant 'one-time' fee. At first taken to a false decoy in the [[Mergui Archipelago]] where male orphans, the females not present, cast balloons at night to ward of the vinyan spirits, the French couple is further misled, as indicated by pointing on a map, to an uninhabited island south of Macleod Island (west of Zadetkale Island) where, their resources depleted, find themselves equally lost in a region of lost male orphans.
