One year after the violent death of Beatrice, Anna ([[Precious Lara Quigaman]]), Carlos ([[Luis Alandy]]) current love starts experiencing supernatural events. Afraid and surprised, Anna thinks that Beatrice's ghost is haunting her. Anna talks to her friend Cathy ([[Roselle Nava]]) and give her an espiritista, Idang ([[Angelika dela Cruz]]), and the medium tells her that Beatrice, powered by her Babang Luksa, is possibly haunting Anna to exact her revenge, as Anna is the main cause of her suicide.

Anna performs a ritual to speak to the dead girl's spirit, and to pacify Beatrice's anger. For a while, the haunting stops… Until the deaths begin. It begins with their common friend, Kris. More perplexed than before, Anna
consults Idang again, who tells her that it is not Beatrice’s spirit that she called out – it is a Sigbin. A spirit trapped within the portal of the mirror, a Sigbin will need to acquire five spirits that are close to the person who set it free – Anna.

Five spirits who have no protection from Death by breaking the power of the pamahiin. The only way to save these five victims is to protect themselves from Death by fulfilling the pamahiin. Despite Idang’s invention, Tita Soledad is killed next .

Idang is ultimately killed by the Sigbin for interfering with its will.Carlo dugs up the body, and cuts the rosary. They are momentarily relieved…
