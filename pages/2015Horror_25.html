Adrian (the character) is as unlikely a killer as [[Norman Bates]], but that’s what makes him so terrifying. This is emotional extreme horror, but you won’t be able to look away. Adrian Țofei’s pointed decision to avoid overt gore, instead concentrating on the interactions, makes the film something akin to a modern ''[[Peeping Tom (film)|Peeping Tom]]''."<ref name="austinchronicle.com"/>

[[Dread Central]] gave the movie 4 stars and wrote that "Be My Cat takes meta-filmmaking to mind-bending levels and plays out like an arthouse snuff film. Simply calling it unique is an understatement. What we have here is potentially revolutionary and, like the most impactful examples of uncompromising art, potentially dangerous. The line between fact and fiction has never been so terrifyingly and brilliantly blurred."<ref>{{cite web|last=Millican |first=Josh |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/117093/be-my-cat-a-film-for-anne-2015/ |title=Be My Cat: A Film for Anne (2015) |publisher=Dread Central |date=2015-08-07 |accessdate=2016-04-13}}</ref>

[[Little White Lies (magazine)|Little White Lies]] wrote that the movie "is a prime example of meta-cinema, endlessly blurring the line between behind-the-scenes reality and onscreen fantasy, between documentary and fiction, while also repeatedly commenting on the process of its own making. The results are an unnerving study in cinephilia and erotomania, falling somewhere between Rémy Belvaux's ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]'' and Patrick Brice’s ''[[Creep (2014 film)|Creep]]''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lwlies.com/articles/be-my-cat-a-film-for-anne-adrian-tofei-dvd/ |title=Discover the stomach-turning horrors of this Anne Hathaway baiting thriller |website=Lwlies.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref>

Found Footage Critic rated the movie 9.7 out of 10 and wrote that it's "a near perfect horror/thriller found footage film that sets itself apart in acting, cinematography, plot, tone, execution and production value. Found footage fan or not, this is a film you won’t want to miss!
