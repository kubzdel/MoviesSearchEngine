== Plot ==
Kate and John Coleman's marriage is strained after their third child, Jessica, was [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. The loss is particularly hard on Kate, who is also recovering from alcoholism. They decide to adopt a 9-year-old [[Russians|Russian]] girl, Esther, from the local orphanage. While Kate and John's 5-year-old deaf-mute daughter Maxine or "Max" embraces Esther almost immediately, their 12-year-old son Daniel is less welcoming. After an argument at dinner, John locks Danny’s treehouse as punishment.

Kate becomes suspicious when Esther expresses far more knowledge of sex than expected of a child her age, such as when Esther walks in on Kate and John having intercourse. When Esther seriously injures school bully Brenda at a local park, Kate initially believes that the event was an accident but becomes alarmed when Sister Abigail, the head of the orphanage, visits with the warning that bad things frequently happen in Esther's vicinity. Esther overhears this and uses Max as a distraction so that she can kill Sister Abigail with a hammer, which she hides in Danny’s treehouse. Kate is convinced that something is wrong with Esther but John does not believe her. Esther is allowed by John to play hooky from school and the dentist. During a conversation, Esther tells him that she doesn't think Kate likes her very much. He says that's not true and that she should do something nice for her. Esther then presents Kate with roses from the grave of their deceased child, Jessica. Kate grabs Esther by the arm, frantic with the fact that she cut the roses. During the night, Esther breaks her arm on purpose to get back at Kate and presents it to John. He kicks Kate from their bedroom due to Esther's request for safety. Kate then buys wine which she refrains from drinking. The next day, Esther causes Kate's car to roll into oncoming traffic with Max inside. Esther points out the wine to John, who tells Kate to go to rehab or he will leave with the kids. Kate finds Esther's hidden Bible and discovers that it came from the Saarne Institute in [[Estonia]], which she eventually learns is a [[mental hospital]]. She {{nowrap|e-mails}} a picture and asks for more information.

When Daniel learns about Sister Abigail's death from Max, he plans to retrieve the hammer and prove Esther's guilt. Esther overhears their conversation and confronts Daniel as he searches the treehouse, setting it on fire and locking Daniel inside. Daniel falls to the ground trying to escape and is knocked unconscious with a major neck injury. Esther attempts to kill him with a rock but Max stops her. While Daniel is hospitalized, Esther slips into his room and tries to smother him with a pillow but doctors quickly revive him. Kate realizes what Esther did to Daniel and attacks Esther but orderlies help John to restrain her. As John takes Esther and Max home, doctors sedate Kate.

That night, Esther tries to seduce a drunken John, who finally believes Kate was right and threatens to send Esther back to the orphanage. Meanwhile, as Kate is coming out of sedation, she receives a call from Doctor Värava at the Saarne Institute, who reveals that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer from Estonia. She has [[hypopituitarism]], a condition that stunted her physical growth and caused dwarfism, and has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. Värava tells Kate that Leena is extremely violent with a dangerous mental illness and has murdered at least seven people, including a family who adopted her in Estonia; after the father rejected her sexual advances, she burned their house down in revenge. Leena was later put into a straight jacket, which she constantly fought to get out of, leaving scars on her wrists and neck. Leena had covered these scars with ribbons as part of her “Esther” disguise.

Leena flies into a rage after being spurned by John and ransacks her room. She removes her makeup, false teeth, and body wrappings, revealing wrinkles and dark spots on her face, badly decayed adult teeth, and a fully mature figure despite her short stature. Leena then shuts the power in the whole house. John later discovers Esther’s paintings in her trashed room, which show hidden pornography and gore under the black light from her fish tank.  Leena stabs John to death. Max witnesses this and hides. Kate cannot reach John on the phone, so she calls the police and rushes home to find him dead. Leena gets a gun from John's safe and shoots Kate in the arm, then goes searching for Max, finding her in the greenhouse. While Leena shoots at Max, Kate crawls onto the greenhouse roof, breaks through the glass above Leena, and lands on her, knocking her out. Kate takes the gun and leaves the greenhouse with Max.

Leena regains consciousness and finds Kate and Max outside near a frozen pond. Leena lunges at Kate, knocking the gun out of Kate's hand and hurling them both onto the ice. Max watches from a hill above, picks up the gun and tries to shoot Leena, but shatters the ice instead, causing Kate and Leena to drop into the water. After a brief struggle, Kate climbs partially out of the pond with Leena clinging to her legs. Leena, hiding a knife behind her back and reverting to her little-girl persona, begs Kate not to let her die, calling her "mommy." Kate angrily responds that she is not her mother and kicks Leena in the face, breaking her neck and letting her sink into the pond. Max and Kate are met by the police moments after.

==Controversy==
The film's content, depicting a murderous adoptee, was not well received by adoption groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/07/16/MV1N18L5U1.DTL|website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|title=Adoption groups angry with 'Orphan' stereotypes|date=July 17, 2009}}</ref> The controversy caused filmmakers to change a line in one of their trailers from: "It must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as your own," to:"I don't think Mommy likes me very much."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/10/entertainment/et-quick10.S4|title=Quick Takes: Uproar over Orphan movie|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Rachel|last=Abramowitz|date=July 10, 2009}}</ref> Melissa Fay Greene of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' commented: "The movie ''Orphan'' comes directly from this unexamined place in popular culture. Esther's shadowy past includes Eastern Europe; she appears normal and sweet, but quickly turns violent and cruel, especially toward her mother. These are clichés. This is the baggage with which we saddle abandoned, orphaned, or disabled children given a fresh start at family life."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-07-15/demon-orphan/|title=The New Movie Parents Hate|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|last=Greene|first=Melissa Fay|date=July 15, 2009}}</ref> There is a pro-adoption service message on the DVD, advising viewers to consider adoption.
