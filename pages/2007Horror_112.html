==Plot==
{{rewrite section|date=June 2017}}
(I) The stripper Rachel is hit by a cab but survives in the emergency room of a hospital. However, she sees Death chasing her, but she does not succeed in convincing the nurses. She is drugged and wakes up in St. Joseph, a mental hospital administrated by Dr. Brown. She finds five other inmates that had a near death experience and also claim that Death is coming for them, but Dr. Brown tells them that they are subject of a mass hypnosis experiment. Meanwhile, Rachel's boyfriend and student of medicine Liam seeks her nearby the night-club. While trying to escape from the facility, Rachel discloses the truth about Dr. Brown and St. Joseph.

(II) Death comes for us all, but after surviving a car crash that should have taken her life, Rachel Wilson finds herself stalked by the Grim Reaper himself intending on taking a soul he feels he is owed. Barely conscious in the ER room, Rachel struggles to convince the nurses that Death is coming for her and that her life is hanging in the balance. Supposedly, for her own protection, Rachel is locked up in a secure mental health facility. But it's not long before she discovers that her incarceration in the old hospital was no coincidence, surrounded by six other "patients" who, themselves, have cheated death. Over the course of the night they will have to face their worst fears, their own mortality, and Death himself.

Blalock from ''Terror Hook.com'' awarded the film a score of 2 / 10 stating, "Well, I can't say I am surprised by how much I didn't like this film - I kind of expected it but was hoping for the best. This film to be honest is one slasher film I found myself bored with rather quickly".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blalock|first1=Rick|title=Terror Hook Review|url=http://www.terrorhook.com/reviews/g/grimreaper.html|website=Terror Hook.com|publisher=Rick L.

''Absolute Horror'' awarded the film a score of 2 / 4, stating, "Sadly, what really might have saved GRIM REAPER and its vaguely original idea was some good execution, something in very short supply here".<ref>{{cite web|title=Absolute Horror: GRIM REAPER|url=http://horror.blogs.com/absolute_horror/2007/05/grim_reaper.html|website=Horror Blogs.com|publisher=Absolute Horror crew|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref>
