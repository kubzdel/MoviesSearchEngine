'''''Digging up the Marrow''''' is a 2014 horror film written and directed by [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]].  It stars Green as a fictionalized version of himself who, in the process of making a documentary about monsters, is contacted by a man, played by [[Ray Wise]], who insists that he can prove monsters are real.

== Plot ==

Filmmaker [[Adam Green (filmmaker)|Adam Green]] begins a [[documentary]] about artwork that features monsters.  Green is surprised when William Dekker, a retired police officer, contacts him and claims to have proof of the existence of monsters.  Green's wife reacts skeptically, but he reworks his documentary to focus on Dekker and his efforts to expose the monsters' underground home, which he calls "The Marrow". Green interviews Dekker at his house, who claims that he has seen many monsters and identified some of them through sketches. Dekker mentions his son once but diverts from the topic when Green inquires. The shooting crew of Green and his cameraman wait at the Marrow's entrance; a dug-up hole in the cemetery in the woods. On the first night they do not see anything although Dekker keeps claiming that he could see one of the monsters. 

Next time they do capture a footage of a monster for a brief time interval, but there is a disbelief as to whether it is a [[hoax]] setup by Dekker. Then they make an arrangement of five cameras and light to capture footage in the absence of their cameraman. One of the cameras, Camera-2, goes missing. Other cameras capture monsters, and later reveals that Dekker visits often and communicates, or feeds, one of the monsters at the Marrow. However the footage is not very clear. Meanwhile, Green finds out that Dekker had approached other directors with his story and the Boston police department do not recognize him. This arouses suspicion and Green tries to gather more footage to confirm hoax (or reality) at the Marrow one night with his cameraman. Dekker arrives there too, and soon they are violently attacked by monsters. They escape in their car. Green and his cameraman leaves the house. Next morning they find that Dekker has abandoned the house and they couldn't trace him. However, there is a room with broken chains, implying a monster been trapped there. Dekker probably believes that one of the monsters is his son and used to trap him there. The movie ends with footage from camera-2 (the one that had been missing) showing a monster that keeps Dekker trapped in a cage, and attacks Green at his home.

== Production ==
The initial concept for the film came from [[fan mail]] sent by [[Alex Pardee]] that purported to tell the true history of a character Green had created, [[Victor Crowley]].  Green was taken with the mail and wanted to interview the author, but he could not interest anyone else in the project, as they were worried that the fan could turn out to be unbalanced.  The project further coalesced when Green met Pardee at a convention.  Pardee, an artist, shared his story ''Digging Up the Marrow'', in which an artist is commissioned to paint purportedly real monsters.  Green then combined the two ideas.  Casting for Dekker was difficult for the filmmakers, because they were not sure whether they should use an unknown or a famous actor.  Ultimately, they decided that it would be too distracting for audiences to suddenly be taken out of the film when real monsters were introduced.  As a result, Wise was cast so that it would be obvious from the start that the film was not an attempted hoax.  Though Wise's casting was initially controversial among people to whom Green showed a work print, they came around to his point of view when he explained the reasoning.<ref name=dd1>{{cite web|url=http://dailydead.com/exclusive-adam-green-getting-personal-chasing-monsters-digging-marrow-part-one/|title=Exclusive: Adam Green on Getting Personal and Chasing Monsters for Digging Up the Marrow (Part One)|last=Bromley|first=Patrick|work=Daily Dead|date=2015-02-18|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>  Of casting himself, Green said that it grounded the film and made the events seem more real.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/89971/exclusive-adam-green-talks-digging-marrow-part-1/|title=Exclusive: Adam Green Talks Digging Up The Marrow – Part 1|last=Hallam|first=Scott|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2015-02-17|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>  When writing the script, Green wanted to make sure that the in-jokes did not impact on the enjoyment of general audiences unfamiliar with his work.

Production began in 2010 and slowly progressed over the next four years whenever Green had free time between projects.<ref name=dd1/>  Green suffered two major setbacks during filming: the death of his friend [[Dave Brockie]], and his divorce from [[Rileah Vanderbilt]].  Both events caused him to question the project, and he was tempted to remove their scenes.  In both cases, he was convinced not to.  In order to keep a low profile, Green announced that he was making an art documentary.  He said this because he believed that the only way the film could work was if it were not hyped, and he knew that the film would attract unwanted attention if its true subject matter were leaked.  The opening interviews were unscripted, but everything else was.  The actors were not given a full script but had to work with only their own lines.<ref name=dd1/>  Barratt was the only actor who read the entire script.<ref name=ew>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/16/adam-green-digging-up-the-marrow|title=How Adam Green's Digging Up the Marrow turned into a real-life horrorshow|last=Collis|first=Clark|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2015-02-16|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>  Despite some reviews that praised the film as a guerrilla production, it was not.<ref name=dd2/>

Most of the film's effects were practical.  Sculptor [[Greg Aronowitz]] worked off of Pardee's designs, and Pardee supervised.  Robert Pendergraft created the make-up effects, fabricated the monsters, and operated them.<ref name=ew/>  Green knew that he would have to show monsters in a self-described monster film, but the team had difficulty in creating working animatronic monsters, as Pardee's designs were so surreal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-adam-green-on-digging-up-the-marrow-part-one/|title=Q&A: Adam Green on "DIGGING UP THE MARROW", Part One|last=Hanley|first=Ken W.|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2015-02-12|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>  Green said there were no ego issues involved in the process, and Pardee and Aronowitz still enjoy collaborating in their spare time for fun.<ref name=fangoria2>{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-adam-green-on-digging-up-the-marrow-part-two/|title=Q&A: Adam Green on "DIGGING UP THE MARROW", Part Two|last=Hanley|first=Ken W.|work=[[Fangoria]]|date=2015-02-20|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>  When each monster was designed, it would inspire different monsters.  Green said that he wanted to use monster designs that were unique, instead of redoing designs that had been seen many times before.  According to Green, because the studios were uninterested in original designs, the film was only possible as an independent production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/374601-digging-marrow-new-creative-monsters-horror/|title=Digging up the Marrow: Where Are All the New, Creative Monsters in Horror?|last=Barone|first=Matt|work=[[Shock Till You Drop]]|date=2015-02-19|accessdate=2015-03-26}}</ref>
