Horrornews.net notes that "''MM'' fits nicely into a category of extreme crime and extreme violence like a welcoming cousin. Probably more attuned to sit closer to on-your-shelf films like ''[[A Serbian Film]]'', ''[[Kalifornia]]'', and ''[[I Stand Alone (film)|I Stand Alone]]'' than say ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' or ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]''. The film doesn't need subtitles, but it might be a recommended option for viewers who feel weird about 90 minutes of intense screaming bellowing out and disturbing your neighbors."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://horrornews.net/10562/film-review-mutilation-mile/ | title=Film Review: Mutilation Mile (2009) | work=Horrornews.net | date=April 13, 2011 | accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>
