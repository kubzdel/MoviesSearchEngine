Walking his dog late at night in the back alleys of his hometown of [[Nashville]], Korine encountered trash bins strewn across the ground in what he imagined as a war zone. Overhead lights beamed down upon the trash in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style that Korine found very dramatic. They began to resemble human form, beaten, abused and “very humpable.”<ref name="nymag">Ebiri, Bilge. (2009-10-09). "[http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2009/10/harmony_korine_on.html Harmony Korine on How Fatherhood Influenced His New Movie About Having Sex With Garbage Cans]." [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]. Retrieved on 2009-10-21.</ref> Korine remembered, as a teenager growing up in Nashville, a group of elderly peeping toms who would come out at night. He has described them as "the neighborhood boogeymen who worked at [[Krispy Kreme]] and would wrap themselves in shrubbery, cover themselves with dirt, and peep through the windows of other neighbors."<ref name="krispy">Treihaft, Lauren; Brooks, Brian (2009-09-17). "[http://www.indiewire.com/article/harmony_korine_they_were_the_neighborhood_boogeymen_who_worked_at_krispy_k/ Harmony Korine: 'I’m not going to lie and say that I don’t like provoking an audience']." [[IndieWire]]. Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref> Putting these two ideas together, Korine found conception for the film.

As a child of the 1980s, Korine grew up in the age of VHS. He remembers his first camera, given to him by his father, and reusing the tape over and over again. “There was something interesting about certain images or scenes bubbling up to the surface.”<ref name="eyeweekly">Bilton, Chris. (2009-09-14). "[http://www.eyeweekly.com/blog/tiff/article/71636 Interview: Harmony Korine]." [[Eye Weekly]]. Retrieved on 2009-10-21.</ref> On the rationale for using VHS as the medium for ''Trash Humpers'', Korine stated “There’s this obsession nowadays with technology and the fact that everything looks so clear. Everything needs to be so [[high-definition video|high-definition]]. There was a strange beauty in the [[Analog television|analog]]. You almost have to squint to see things through the grain and the mist. There’s something sinister about it.”<ref name="nymag"/>

Upset over the bureaucracy in producing his last and most expensive feature, ''[[Mister Lonely]]'', Korine aimed to make his next film as fast as he could, analogous to the free-form immediacy of painter and canvas.<ref name="nymag"/> As a self-proclaimed "mistakist artist", Korine encouraged spontaneity. Like ''[[Julien Donkey-Boy]]'', the script was merely a collection of written down ideas. Before filming, Korine shot [[lo-fi]] images of people in costumes late at night to help find his aesthetic.<ref>www.hammertonail.com/interviews/a-conversation-with-harmony-korine-trash-humpers/</ref>

Filming lasted only a couple of weeks. “Once everyone was in their character and their costume, and I had figured out the structure of it, the randomness, the anti-aesthetic, it was really the performers, the Trash Humpers, walking around at night, videotaping each other doing these things,”<ref name="hammer">Tully, Michael (2009-09-16). "[http://www.hammertonail.com/dialogues/harmony-korine-trash-humpers-interview/ A Conversation With Harmony Korine]." Hammer to Nail. Retrieved on 2009-09-19.</ref> Korine recalled. "We would just walk around and sleep under bridges or behind a strip mall somewhere. We’d get these big tractor tires and make a nest to sleep in."<ref name="nymag"/> Korine adds, “it was pretty intense because there were no breaks. It was just constant.<ref name="hammer"/> Korine says that he didn't think traditionally about scenes, sounds, or color during filming, but more about being true to a feeling. "If it feels right to me. If there is some strong, palpable, raw quality in the moment then I won't question it."<ref name="krispy"/> Korine himself plays as one of the Trash Humpers, simultaneously taking on the role of actor, cinematographer, and director.

Korine cut the film on two [[VCR]]s to instill an approximate randomness. "I wanted a kind of incidental awkwardness, like maybe the guy taping it had turned it off and on."<ref name="nymag"/> Korine often cites that in creation of the film he aimed to mimic a found object or artifact. He even flirted with the idea of “leaving the film on a sidewalk somewhere”<ref name="nymag"/> to be unearthed at random, but ultimately decided he would claim ownership.

At the film’s premiere in [[Toronto]], Korine informed the audience that the title was to be taken quite literally and those likely to walk out were given due warning. Aware of his status as the provocateur, Korine understands his movies aren’t for everyone. “That’s why I named it Trash Humpers, because I didn’t want to fool anyone.”<ref name="eyeweekly"/> There were only four months between filming started and the world premiere.<ref name="hammer"/>

For Korine, ''Trash Humpers'' is an elaborate portrait of the "American Landscape" : a series of "park garages, back alleyways, and beautiful lamp posts that light up the gutter." Korine has repeatedly emphasized his use of street lamps and how they are for him deeply representative of America.<ref name="krispy"/>

Korine sees the film as an ode to vandalism. "I have a real deep love and admiration for these characters. Not for what they do, but for the way they do it."<ref name="nymag"/> "There can be a creative beauty in their mayhem and destruction. You could say these characters are poets or [[mysticism|mystics]] of mayhem… comedic with a [[vaudeville|vaudevillian]] horror."<ref name="nypress">Kohn, Eric. (2009-09-30). "[http://www.nypress.com/article-20410-his-humps.html His Humps]." [[New York Press]]. Retrieved on 2009-10-21.</ref> Korine wondered "whether this might make mainstream society envious of their social freedom."<ref name="krispy"/> <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTMMTgyy4Fg| Brows Held High-Trash Humpers on YouTube</ref>

==Reception==
The film received polarized reviews, with a 59% rating from 39 reviews on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>[[Rotten Tomatoes]]: {{Citation|title=Trash Humpers|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trash-humpers|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>

Rob Nelson of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' remarked that the film is highly unlikely to gratify all audiences, and questioned what its notability would have been without the director's "hipster celebrity." However, intrigued by the film, he commented the cinematography as having "no small share of perverse beauty, particularly for those who miss the charming imperfections of videocassettes in this squeaky-clean digital era."<ref>Nelson, Rob (2009-09-16).

The film won the DOX Award at the [[Copenhagen International Documentary Festival]] in November 2009. <ref>https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/the-wondrous-world-of-harmony-korine-close-up-on-mister-lonely-and-trash-humpers| The Wondrous World of Harmony Korine: Close-Up on "Mister Lonely" and "Trash Humpers" on Notebook|MUBI</ref>
