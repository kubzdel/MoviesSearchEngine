'''''Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep''''', also known as '''''Deadly Water''''', is a 2006 [[made-for-television]] [[horror film|natural horror]] [[B-movie]] produced by [[Nu Image Films]] and [[Brightlight Pictures]] as a Sci Fi Channel original film. It premiered on the [[Syfy|Sci Fi channel]] on September 23, 2006. Directed by [[Tibor Tak치cs (director)|Tibor Tak치cs]] and starring [[Charlie O'Connell]], [[Victoria Pratt]], and [[Jack Scalia]], the film focuses on a marine biologist and a sailor who join forces to find lost Trojan treasures while battling the giant squid who killed the sailor's parents while he was a child, and a treasure hunting mobster who wants the items for himself. The film was primarily panned by critics for the special effects, far-fetched plot, and scarcity of scenes involving the titular creature.

==Plot==
As a child, Ray Reiter ([[Charlie O'Connell]]) was the sole survivor when a [[giant squid]], or [[kraken]], attacked his parents' boat. In the present, marine archaeologist Nicole ([[Victoria Pratt]]) and her assistants Michael ([[Cory Monteith]]) and Jenny ([[Kristi Angus]]) are searching for a legendary [[opal]] and a [[Troy|Trojan]] [[death mask]] in the same area.

During an outing Nicole's boat is attacked and the boat's captain is killed leaving everyone in a panic frenzy. The survivors are forced to return to shore and begin to fix their boat while searching for a new skipper. Ray, a sea creature hobbyist pays a visit after learning about the circumstances of the previous skipper's death on the news. While Nicole is suspicious she allows Ray to join the team in return that he fixes her boat. Maxwell Odemus ([[Jack Scalia]]), Nicole's competitor,  arrives to taunt Nicole and then offer to join forces with her, but she declines as he tends to steal other people's archaeological finds to sell on the black market. Eventually, Nicole and Ray find the likely spot for the opal and return to shore to prepare themselves for the retrieval mission.

That night, Maxwell has one of his goons, Ike ([[Aleks Paunovic]]) pay off Michael to learn where Nicole & crew are going, then has their boat burned. Recognizing the distress and broken-dreamed Nicole, Ray buys a new boat using his life savings, and the crew heads back out. Maxwell uses the co-ordinates acquired from Michael to drive out to the treasure spot and his group attack when Nicole's team arrive. Holding Michael, Jenny, and Sally hostage to force Nicole and Ray to cooperate and dive for the artifacts even though the squid is certainly waiting below, Maxwell gets Ike to shoot Michael, who dies not too long after. Sally, Jenny, and Nicole still are in a fish container that starts flooding from the Kraken attacking the boat. Ray emerges from the water and climbs onto the ship and frees Jenny, Sally, and Nicole and leave Michael's corpse. In the battle that ensues, the Kraken kills Ike, Jenny, Sally, and Maxwell before being killed by Nicole and Ray. The boat sinks, while Nicole and Ray are safe and Ray saved the mask.  The opal is last seen at the bottom of the sea and the film cuts into credits.

'''Note (Alternate version):'''

The scene of Nicole's team being attacked by Maxwell's gang and being forced to dive for the artifacts is changed to Kate being killed by the squid underwater, the other members of Maxwell's gang attacking Ray and Nicole underwater after they found the opal, and Nicole being caught by Maxwell when she surface.

The scene of Michael being shot remains but for the reason of Nicole refusing to tell Maxwell where she kept the mask.

The scene with Sally ([[Michal Yannai]]) is slightly changed to a scene with only Sally removed.

The scene of Nicole and Ray killing the giant squid is changed to only Ray killing the squid.

==Reception==
Reviewing the film for [[UGO Networks]], Troy Rogers praised the film for its "straightforward and easy to follow" storyline and its special effects. Cautioning that viewers needed to approach the film with the right "outlook", he felt it a "cool mindless way to spend a Saturday night" that "offers a boatload of entertainment".<ref name="UGO"/> When the initial premise of the movie was announced as part of the contest, Jon Condit of [[Dread Central]] found it to be the "most far-fetched premise of all time" and notes that Sci Fi later began describing it in a "more of a run-of-the-mill creature feature" way. He joked that the film's final title ended up being the same sort of title one would expect Sci Fi themselves to create, and calling it a "stinker" suggested that Sci Fi should have allowed the winner to make the film itself.<ref name="DC1"/><ref name="DC2">{{cite web |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/kraken-tentacles-deep-dvd |title=Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep (DVD) |first=Jon |last=Condit |date=September 26, 2006 |publisher=Dread Central |accessdate=July 4, 2009 }}</ref> He heavily criticized the producers for "[reducing] the title monster to being nothing more than a recurring plot device that isn't even the centerpiece of the film", and felt you could completely remove the squid from the film with little impact.<ref name="DC2" /> When the squid is seen, Condit found it "boring", stating that its "attacks [were] among the least suspenseful ever seen in an animal gone amok type of flick.".<ref name="DC2" /> [[DVD Talk]]'s Scott Weinberg considered it "one of the silliest monster movies I've ever seen" and compared it to a [[Lifetime Television]] film "with a few gory bits".<ref name="DVD Talk Weinberg">{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/27078/kraken-tentacles-of-the-deep/ |title=Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep |first=Scott |last=Weinberg |date=March 18, 2007 |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |accessdate=July 4, 2009 }}</ref> Calling it a "ungainly, cheap-looking, and frankly boring flick", he dismissed the unrealistic special effects, "photogenic automaton" cast, and the script as a "clumsy mish-mash of cliche, stereotype and stupidity".<ref name="DVD Talk Weinberg" />
