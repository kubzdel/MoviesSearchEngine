'''''A Nightmare on Elm Street''''' is a 2010 American [[Psychological horror|psychological]] [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[slasher film]] directed by [[Samuel Bayer]], and written by [[Wesley Strick]] and [[Eric Heisserer]]. The film stars [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Kyle Gallner]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. It is a [[remake]] of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|1984 film of the same name]]; produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Platinum Dunes]], it is designed to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]]. The film centers around a group of teenagers being stalked and murdered in their dreams by a man named [[Freddy Krueger]], ultimately discovering they all share a common link from their childhood that is making them targets for Freddy.

''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', with the writers taking the best elements from each of the films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a simple child killer. The decision was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance closer to that of an actual burn victim, and the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming others films in the same area.

Craven has expressed his displeasure with the remaking of his film, primarily because he was not consulted on the project as has been done on previous films of his that have been remade. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was officially released in North America on April 30, 2010, and later released in foreign markets on May 8, 2010. The film was met with primarily negative reviews from film critics, as well as audience members who scored the film a "C+" according to [[CinemaScore]] polls. Regardless, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' broke the record for midnight openings for a horror film, and was able to gross more in its opening weekend than the entire theatrical gross for four other ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' films. The film has brought in over $63 million at the domestic box office, and over $115 million worldwide.

==Plot==
<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE the basic events. For a horror movie, we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !-->
Kris Fowles ([[Katie Cassidy]]) goes to the Springwood Diner to meet with her ex-boyfriend, Dean Russell ([[Kellan Lutz]]), who falls asleep at the table and meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend, waitress [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Holbrook]] ([[Rooney Mara]]), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Jesse Braun ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: [[Freddy Krueger]] ([[Jackie Earle Haley]]).

Jesse is apprehended by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris, and is killed by Krueger when he falls asleep in his jail cell. With her friends dying, Nancy begins to question what everyone's connection is to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith ([[Kyle Gallner]]) discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen ([[Connie Britton]]), reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a gardener at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of abusing Nancy and the rest of the kids. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day telling her mother about a hidden space in Krueger's room and the things he did to her there. Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep.

Quentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than [[Repressed memory|repressed memories]], but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger: Everyone's parents hunted down Krueger and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their [[insomnia]], they begin sporadically dreaming while they are still awake. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool and learn what they can. On the way, Nancy falls asleep and is attacked by Krueger, but when Quentin wakes her up, they discover she has pulled a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dreamworld and into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. At the preschool, Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.

Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would no longer be able to wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.

==Production==
''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally going to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements from each of the films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.

The decision was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance closer to that of an actual burn victim, and the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area.

===Development===
On January 29, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Michael Bay]] and his [[Platinum Dunes]] production company would be [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooting]] the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise with a [[remake]] of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original 1984 film]].<ref name="NightAnno">{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=New Line sets up new 'Nightmare'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2008<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pURUYBDM|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> In an interview, producer Brad Fuller initially explained that they were following the same line they did with their [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|''Friday the 13th'' remake<!--STOP. Form and Fuller have consistently referred to the film as a "remake"!-->]], by abandoning the things that made the character less scary—the film's antagonist, [[Freddy Krueger]], would not be "cracking jokes" as had become a staple of his character in later films—and focusing more on trying to craft a "horrifying movie". Fuller expressed how everyone at the studio loved the concept of being killed if you fell asleep. The producer stated that the film would be a remake of the 1984 film, but clarified that they would be borrowing certain character deaths and [[dream sequence]]s from the entire ''Nightmare'' series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=8835|title=Nightmare on Elm Street is Go, Shooting in Spring|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=[[CraveOnline]]|date=December 11, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pURdhXuq|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref>

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Samuel Bayer]] was hired to direct the film.<ref name="Director">{{cite news|url=http://riskybusiness.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/02/11/a-director-moves-onto-nightmare-on-elm-street/ |last=Zeitchik |first=Steven |title=A director moves onto (Nightmare on) Elm Street |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=February 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517041553/http://riskybusiness.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/02/11/a-director-moves-onto-nightmare-on-elm-street/ |archivedate=May 17, 2010 }}</ref> According to New Line production chief Toby Emmerich, Michael Bay advocated heavily for Bayer's hiring, as Bay, Bayer, and director [[David Fincher]] came up as commercial directors together. It is Bay's opinion that Bayer had "the ability to capture the kind of seductive and unsettling imagery that would make ''Nightmare'' feel like a fresh, visually arresting moviegoing experience".<ref name="LAint">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-bigpicture14-2009jul14,0,698071.story|title='Nightmare on Elm Street' returns|last=Goldstein|first=Patrick|date=July 14, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=August 1, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pURpx3Hx|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> Bayer declined Platinum Dunes' offer; twice.

In a June 9, 2009 interview, Craven expressed his displeasure in the remaking of his 1984 film, primarily because the filmmakers chose not to have him as a consultant to the film, unlike with the 2009 remake ''[[The Last House on the Left (2009 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' where he "shepherd[ed] it towards production".<ref name="Cravenint">{{cite news|last=Parfitt|first=Orlando|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/992/992845p1.html|title=Craven's Elm Street Nightmare Exclusive: Original director angry over remake.|work=[[IGN Entertainment]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=June 9, 2009|accessdate=June 19, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pURypVSG|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> In contrast, [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy throughout the film series, felt it was time for ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' to be remade. Englund liked the idea of being able to "exploit the dreamscape" with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and other technologies that did not exist when Craven was making the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' in 1984.<ref name="Englundint">{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b15904_exclusive_robert_englund_on_jackie.html|title=Robert Englund on Jackie Earle Haley and the 'Nightmare' Remake!|work=[[FEARnet]]|publisher=Horror Entertainment|date=June 27, 2009|accessdate=June 29, 2009<!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUS5KfH1|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> Subsequently, Bayer believed that the film is designed to pay homage to what Craven did in 1984, but not replicate it entirely. Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films, and that the character of Freddy Krueger was one that affected the lives of a certain generation of people. For Bayer, remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was about bringing that feeling to a new generation, with a new spin on the character and story.<ref name="Bayerint"/>

Fuller and Form likened the new ''Nightmare'' film to their [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake]] of ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'', and retracted an earlier statement when they said they did not plan to "cherry pick" the best elements of the franchise, like they did with the reboot of the ''Friday the 13th'' franchise they released in 2009. Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining.<ref name="setpreview">{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|title=Set Visit Preview: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUSKpwly|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> The pair also explained that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' would have a different tone than the ''Friday the 13th'' remake. Form states, "I think a ''Friday the 13th'' movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, and I think a ''Nightmare'' movie is not that."<ref name="SiFi">{{cite news|url=http://scifiwire.com/2009/07/join-us-behind-the-scenes.php|title=UPDATED: Behind the scenes of the new Nightmare on Elm Street|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|date=July 22, 2009|work=[[Sci-Fi Wire]]|publisher=[[SyFy]]|accessdate=July 30, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUST0W9n|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref>

When asked why New Line was rebooting the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' film series, Emmerich explained, "The ''Nightmare'' films are profoundly disturbing on a deep, human level because they're about our dreams. It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture."<ref name="LAint"/> Overall, Bayer wanted to create a darker ''Nightmare on Elm Street'', one he felt would fit into what he describes as "a darker world". Bayer said there is subtext within the film, which is designed to get the audience to ask, "What makes a monster?" Bayer wants the audience to think about whether a monster is something that exists purely from a physical appearance—someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove on their hand—or can a monster be something that is deeper, and within the man himself without a scarred face and bladed glove?<ref name="Rotint"/>

===Writing===
Wesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'', after he impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''; the film was never produced. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production.<ref name="LAint"/> When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer, and which still "needed to be tinkered with". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into "[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was". Bayer expressed that, unlike the ''Friday the 13th'' remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the ''Nightmare'' remake is coming straight from the first film.<ref name="Bayerint"/> At one point there was a scene in an early draft of the script where some characters were playing ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Fuller explained that the scene was removed to keep the film from feeling dated. To him, if someone watched the film five years later, and ''Guitar Hero'' was not as popular as it once was, it would automatically make the film feel more dated upon viewing. At the same time, they wanted the film to feel relevant, and including things like the Internet, mobile phones, and text messaging would give the film a more timeless feel.<ref name="Bloodint">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19996|title=Producer Brad Fuller Talks 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|author=Chris Eggertsen|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=The Collective|date=April 28, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUSx13d0|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref>

For the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]]. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened.<ref name="Bloodint"/> In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19219|title=Set Visit: A Trip to 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' Part One|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=The Collective|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=May 6, 2010<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pXNOGS06|archivedate=May 6, 2010-->}}</ref>

In February 2009, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed Robert Englund would not reprise the role of Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films.<ref name="Director"/> On April 3, 2009 ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported that [[Jackie Earle Haley]] was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role.<ref name="Haleyanno">{{cite news|last=Rich|first=Joshua|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/nightmare-haley.html|title='Nightmare on Elm Street' reboot: Jackie Earle Haley to play Freddy Krueger|work=Hollywood Insider|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405090144/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2009/04/nightmare-haley.html|dead-url=yes|archivedate=April 5, 2009}}</ref> Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown for the role of Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in ''[[Little Children (film)|Little Children]]'' that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie really has all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part."<ref name="LAint"/> Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''; after viewing it, Bayer said it "blew [his] mind", and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a "[psychopath] with a burned face and a claw".<ref name="Bayerint"/>

Haley said the first time he heard his name mentioned in conjunction with the character was from people suggesting his casting on the internet, which he appreciated, and then later learned that his agents were already in talks with Brad Fuller.<ref name="MTVint">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1625034/story.jhtml|title='Nightmare On Elm Street' New Freddy Krueger Thanks Fans For Casting|last=Carroll|first=Larry|work=MTV|publisher=[[Viacom]]|date=October 31, 2009|accessdate=April 29, 2010<!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUTq3Mi0|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref> Haley stated that he was apprehensive about taking on the role of a character with such a dark past—that of a child murderer—for about a "minute and a half". Knowing the Freddy Krueger in the remake would be even darker, Haley came to the realization quickly that at the end of the day he is doing a horror film, and this is just a fictional character. Haley said that once he embraced the idea of Freddy just being a "mythical boogeyman", it became "very freeing" for him as an actor.<ref name="Rotint">{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=15025|title=Video Interviews: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=April 29, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010<!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUU0rGcP|archivedate=May 4, 2010-->}}</ref>

Gallner described his character as "a mess, more jittery and more 'out there' than Nancy is".<ref name="prodnote"/> Gallner pointed out that his character is like this because of the amount of pharmaceuticals he ingests to stay awake. Producer Brad Fuller commented that Gallner brought a sense of "humanity and relatability" to the role with his compassion and intellect.<ref name="prodnote"/> Other cast members include [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. Cassidy performed the role of Kris. According to Cassidy, Kris becomes an emotional wreck throughout the film. Cassidy described her character's ordeal: "She is literally dragged through hell, having to crawl through dark, claustrophobic tunnels. She's always crying and freaking out as her nightmares of Freddy bleed into her everyday life. Kris suspects there's something that connects her with the others; she even confronts her mother about it, but no one's talking."<ref name="prodnote"/>

===Krueger's design===
[[File:Freddyremake.jpg|thumb|Haley wore prosthetic appliances on his face that were blended together to appear seamless and designed to look close to an actual burn victim. [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used on portions of his face—like his cheek—that appear open.]]
Discussing his physical appearance, Form and Fuller explained that Freddy would be more similar to a real burn victim.<ref name="SiFi"/> Form later clarified that there was a fine line they did not want to cross when it came to making Freddy look like a true burn victim. According to the producer, the crew had many reference photos of actual victims, which detailed how white the skin would appear after healing. Form did not want the audience to turn away in disgust every time Freddy was on the screen, so they opted to hold back on some of the realism. Fuller noted how horrific the images were, and how difficult they were to look at.<ref name="Shockset">{{cite news|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=14163|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|title=Set Visit: A Nightmare Reborn on Elm Street|publisher=CraveOnline|work=Shock Till You Drop|date=February 22, 2010|accessdate=May 2, 2010<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUWVsKSw|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref> The special effects crew that worked on ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', creating the computer-generated images (CGI) for [[Two-Face]]'s face, were brought in to work on the minimal CGI used for Freddy's face. The CGI is used in conjunction with the special effects make-up that Haley wears.<ref name="Rotint"/> The prosthetics used to create Freddy's physical look were designed by Andrew Clement. Haley described the experience of wearing all of the prosthetics and make-up as "pretty encumbering".<ref name="fearint">{{cite news|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18350_Jackie_Earle_Haley_Talks_Playing_Freddy_Krueger.html|title=Jackie Earle Haley Talks Playing Freddy Krueger|work=FEARnet|publisher=Horror Entertainment|last=Raffel|first=Lawrence P.|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=April 29, 2010<!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUWeAS5Z|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref>

When production first started, Clement and his crew would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process.<ref name="Shockset"/> According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head all the way down his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four-and-a-half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of.<ref name="fearint"/> Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's "voice" for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me try this voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a "supernatural quality" and get it away from the voice Haley used as [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] in ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]''.<ref name="SDCC">{{cite news|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/interviewsnews.php?id=11247|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|title=SDCC Press Conference: A Nightmare on Elm Street |publisher=Crave Online Media|work=Shock Till You Drop|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=April 30, 2010<!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUWitEzs|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref>

New Line contracted with two high schools in Illinois, [[Elk Grove High School (Elk Grove Village, Illinois)|Elk Grove High School]] and [[John Hersey High School]], to use their location for scenes in the remake. According to Principal Nancy Holman, of Elk Grove High, the studio contacted schools across the nation looking for one that had a swimming pool.

The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning students be at least 16 years old.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zalusky|first=Steve|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=289286|title=Freddie's coming to Elk Grove, Hersey high schools|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|publisher=Paddock Publications|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=May 6, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUYJ6Vmh|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref> School board President Lenore Gonzales Bragaw was initially apprehensive about the deal, as she disliked the idea of the studio filming "scenes of violence" at the schools; Bragaw agreed to the filming after being assured that no one would be killed during the swimming scenes.<ref>{{cite web|author=Graydon Megan and John Keilman|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-talk-nightmare-follomay01,0,7725616.story|title=Chicago school district won't look a gift 'Nightmare' in the mouth|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=May 7, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUYRMdOK|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref>

On May 22, 2009, the ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' film crew went on location to the city of [[Gary, Indiana]] to film scenes at a Methodist church. The studio negotiated with the city for months before finally settling on a deal. According to Ben Clement, the executive director of the Gary Office of Film and Television, the studio was looking for "an architectural style that would fit the storyline of the film". The film crew returned to Gary in June to film a dream sequence that takes place on Elm Street in one of the local streets, and in December some new scenes were shot in a diner, with new characters.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|url=http://www.thetimesonline.com/articles/2009/05/21/updates/breaking_news/doc4a158020018cd165290762.txt|title=Gary set to be backdrop for scenes in Freddy Krueger remake|work=The Times |publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=June 20, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUYV77PZ|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/105/1053106p1.html|title=Freddy's Nightmare Continues: Casting call notice online for additional Elm Street filming|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|work=[[IGN Entertainment]]|publisher=News Corporation|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=December 28, 2009<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUYalS9D|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref>

According to Fuller and Form, Warner Bros. suggested ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' be released in 3-D, with the recent surge in 3-D films showing increased box office revenue. In the opinion of the Platinum Dunes producers, if a film is not initially conceived as 3-D then it should not be converted to 3-D. In other words, given that the original ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was not a 3-D film, Fuller and Form fought with the studio to keep the remake from being converted to 3-D. The producers note that at the end of the day, Warner Bros. and Platinum Dunes came to the agreement that presenting the film in 3-D would not be presenting "the best version of the movie".<ref>{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|url=http://www.collider.com/2010/04/26/exclusive-interview-producers-andrew-form-and-brad-fuller-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-plus-updates-on-monster-squad-ouija-friday-the-13th-2-and-the-nightmare-blu-ray-will-have-a-6-minute-alternat/|title=Exclusive Interview: Platinum Dunes Producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller ''A Nightmare on Elm Street''|publisher=Collider|date=April 26, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2010<!--|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5pUYhZFLO|archivedate=May 5, 2010-->}}</ref>

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a "B–" and concluded that, "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays a little too much like a corporately ordered rerun.
