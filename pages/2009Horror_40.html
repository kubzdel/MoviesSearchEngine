==Plot==
Coraline Jones and her parents move from [[Pontiac, Michigan]], to their new home in [[Ashland, Oregon]], the dilapidated Pink Palace Apartments. Her eccentric new neighbors include Mr. Bobinsky, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible. Due to her parents constantly working, Coraline frequently explores the apartment. Whilst exploring, she meets a black cat and Wyborne "Wybie" Lovat, the grandson of the landlady, whose twin sister mysteriously disappeared years ago. 

Wybie gives Coraline a button-eyed ragdoll that resembles her. The doll then lures her to a small door in the living room, which is bricked up and can only be unlocked by a button key. That night, a mouse guides her through the door, where the bricks have been replaced by a corridor to the Other World, inhabited by button-eyed [[Doppelgänger|doppelgängers]] of people from her world. Coraline meets the Other Mother and Other Father, who are much more attentive and entertaining than her real parents.  

After dinner, she goes to sleep in her Other Bedroom, but awakes in her real bedroom. Despite cryptic warnings from her neighbors, Coraline visits the Other World three times, where she meets the Other Mr. Bobinsky, the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, and the Other Wybie, who is mute. Despite having no Other World counterpart, the black cat is able to speak in the Other World. 

The Other Mother invites Coraline to stay forever, under the condition that a pair of buttons will be sewn over her eyes. Horrified, Coraline attempts to flee, but the Other Mother has blocked all the exits to the real world. The cat appears and reveals to her the sinister truth about the Other World and the Other Mother. The Other Mother, appearing taller and more grotesque, then "disciplines" Coraline by imprisoning her behind a mirror. There, Coraline meets the ghosts of previous victims, including the missing twin sister of Wybie's grandmother. They reveal that the Other Mother, whom they refer to as the Beldam, created and sent button-eyed rag dolls that resembled them in order to spy on their lives. With the promise of a better life, she lured them into the Other World, where she sewed buttons over their eyes and consumed their lives. To free their souls, their real eyes need to be found. Coraline promises to help.

Coraline is suddenly rescued from the mirror by the Other Wybie, whose mouth has been stitched by the Beldam. He helps her escape back to the real world, but Coraline discovers that her parents are missing. She eventually deduces that they have been kidnapped by the Beldam. The cat advises Coraline to propose a "game": if Coraline cannot find her parents and the ghosts' eyes, she will let buttons be sewn over her eyes, but if she can, they will all be set free. The Beldam reluctantly agrees. 

One by one, Coraline finds the ghosts' eyes in the Other World, now turned nightmarish, from its deranged inhabitants. As she does, the Other Pink Palace Apartments' surroundings gradually disintegrate until only the living room is left. Inside, Coraline sees the Beldam in her [[arachnid|arachnoid]] form. Warned that the Beldam will never accept Coraline's victory, she tricks her into unlocking the door. While the Beldam is distracted, Coraline finds her parents trapped in a [[snow globe]], grabs it, and throws the cat at the Beldam's face, ripping her button eyes out. The Beldam furiously converts the floor into a spiderweb but Coraline manages to climb out of it, slam and lock the door shut on the Beldam's hand, severing it. Her parents reappear in the real world, with no memory of what happened. That night, the ghosts warn her to get rid of the button key to prevent the Beldam from accessing the real world. As Coraline prepares to drop it down the well, the severed hand attacks her and tries to drag her back to the Other World. Wybie smashes it with a rock, then throws the remains and the key into the well and seals it shut.

The next day, Coraline and her parents, who have finally finished their work, host a garden party for the neighbors. Coraline also prepares to tell Mrs. Lovat the truth about her twin sister.

Director [[Henry Selick]] met author [[Neil Gaiman]] just as he was finishing the novel ''[[Coraline]]'', and given that Gaiman was a fan of Selick's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', he invited him to a possible adaptation of the film. As Selick thought a direct adaptation would lead to "maybe a 47-minute movie", his screenplay had some expansions, such as the creation of Wybie. When looking for a design away from the style seen in most animation, Selick discovered the work of Japanese illustrator Tadahiro Uesugi and invited him to become the concept artist. One of Uesugi's biggest influences was on the color palette, which was muted in reality and more colorful in the Other World.<ref name=making>"The Making of Coraline", ''Coraline'' DVD</ref> Uesugi declared that "at the beginning, it was supposed to be a small project over a few weeks to simply create characters; however, I ended up working on the project for over a year, eventually designing sets and backgrounds, on top of drawing the basic images for the story to be built upon."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Desowitz|first1=Bill|title=Tadahiro Uesugi Talks 'Coraline' Design|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/tadahiro-uesugi-talks-coraline-design|publisher=Animation World|accessdate=August 17, 2014|date=January 23, 2009}}</ref>

The soundtrack for ''Coraline'' features songs composed by French composer [[Bruno Coulais]] with one, "Other Father Song", by [[They Might Be Giants]]. The Other Father's singing voice is provided by [[John Linnell]], one of the singers from the band. They wrote 10 songs for the film; when a melancholy tone was decided, all but one were cut.

== Reception ==

===Box office===
According to Paul Dergarabedian, a film business analyst with Media by Numbers, for the film to succeed it needed a box office comparable to ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'', which grossed $16 million its opening weekend and ended up making more than $192 million worldwide; prior to the film's release, Dergarabedian thought Laika "should be really pleased" if it made close to $10 million on its opening weekend.<ref name="wweek"/> In its US opening weekend, the film made $16.85 million, ranking third at the box office.<ref name=THRIntoYou /> It made $15 million on its second weekend, bringing its U.S. total up to $35.6 million, $25.5 million of which coming from 3D presentations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2548 |title=Holdovers Live Under Killer ''Friday'' Debut |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=February 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}</ref> As of November 2009, the film had grossed $75,286,229 in the United States and Canada and $49,310,169 in other territories, making a total of $124,596,398 worldwide.<ref name="boxoffice"/>

The website's critical consensus reads, "With its vivid stop-motion animation combined with Neil Gaiman's imaginative story, ''Coraline'' is a film that's both visually stunning and wondrously entertaining."<ref name="Rotten Tomatoes">{{cite web|title=''Coraline'' (2009)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/coraline/ |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2009}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".<ref>{{cite web|title=''Coraline'' Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/coraline |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date=February 5, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2009}}</ref> 

[[David Edelstein]] said the film is "a ''[[bona fide]]'' [[fairy tale]]" that needed a "touch less entrancement and a touch more&nbsp;... story".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/movies/reviews/53785/ |title=What You See Is What You Get |last=Edelstein |first=David |authorlink=David Edelstein |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=February 1, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}</ref> [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "exquisitely realized" with a "slower pace and a more contemplative tone than the novel. It is certainly exciting, but rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much animation aimed at kids, ''Coraline'' lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/movies/06cora.html?ref=movies| title=Cornered in a Parallel World |last=Scott |first=A.O. |authorlink=A.
