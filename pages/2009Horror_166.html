== Plot ==

William, a psychotic [[Iraq War|Iraq]] veteran, murders a war protester and the man's girlfriend, and poses their bodies in a manner evocative of incidents such as [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]]. Elsewhere, Adrienne, another veteran of the conflict in the [[Middle East]], learns that she will be receiving no government assistance for her [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], which drives her to try and cope with it via marijuana that she procures from Ray, a friend who served in the [[Vietnam War]].

While at a bookstore, William is enraged by the liberal views expressed by two of the clerks, so he kills them, and covers their corpses with pages ripped out of a copy of ''The Interrogators: Inside the Secret War Against [[al-Qaeda]]''. After accompanying Ray to a group therapy session, Adrienne is attacked by a pair of rapists, but she is saved by William, who stabs the criminals to death while Adrienne flees.

William subsequently [[waterboarding|waterboards]] and beheads a janitor who was a member of an environmental activist group, gives money to a homeless and hobbled veteran, converses with Daniel, his [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] older brother who was disfigured in the [[Gulf War]], and kills two supporters of [[MoveOn.org]]. Adrienne, who a suspicious William begins to stalk, contemplates suicide due to her worsening mental state, which leads her to take [[peyote]] provided by Ray.

William slits Ray's throat, convinced that he is a [[dissident]], and abducts Adrienne, who he tortures for "disloyalty" and to try and obtain information on other "Un-Americans". Adrienne breaks free of her restraints and tries to escape, but is fatally stabbed by William. A spasming Adrienne hacks William in the neck with a meat cleaver, and the two die together while William whispers, "I was just following orders."

== Reception ==

The film was well received by Craig McGee of Horror News, who wrote, "If you’re expecting huge production values and top-notch professional actors, and [[THX]] sound, then you'll probably want to sit this one out. But those of us that love and embrace the [[Independent film|indie]] horror world will be enjoying watching what everyone did with obviously so little money to get the job done. In the end, I was impressed, at times shocked, and once or twice even a little moved by it all".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/20099/film-review-quiet-nights-of-blood-and-pain-2009/|title = Film Review: ''Quiet Nights of Blood and Pain'' (2009)|last = McGee|first = Craig|publisher = Horror News|date = 11 July 2010|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 27 December 2015}}</ref> Rogue Cinema's Brian Morton also commended ''Quiet Night of Blood and Pain'', awarding it a score of 3/4, and noting that "it's not perfect, but it's a cool [[Retro style|throwback]] to a lost era of filmmaking and Copp should be commended for doing this!"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.roguecinema.com/quiet-nights-of-blood-and-pain-2009-by-brian-morton.html|title = ''Quiet Nights of Blood and Pain'' (2009) – By Brian Morton|last = Morton|first = Brian|publisher = Rogue Cinema|date = |website = roguecinema.com|accessdate = 27 December 2015}}</ref>
