The ghosts all have unfinished business in the world of the living and Norman is given the task of ending a witch's curse.

==Plot==
In the small town of Blithe Hollow, [[Massachusetts]], Norman Babcock is an 11-year-old boy who [[Mediumship|speaks with the dead]], including his late grandmother and various [[ghost]]s in town. Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe, is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. After rehearsal of a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular [[ritual]] to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Mr. Prenderghast dies.

During the official performance of the school play, Norman has a vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a [[witch hunt]], embarrassing himself and leading to his father Perry grounding him. His mother Sandra tells him that his father's stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees [[Vengeful ghost|Prenderghast's spirit]] who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his [[corpse]]).

He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of [[fairy tales]]. Alvin, a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A ghostly storm resembling the witch appears in the air, summoning the cursed dead to arise as [[zombie]]s, who chase the boys along with Norman's 17-year-old sister, Courtney; and Neil's older brother Mitch, down the hill and into town. Having realized that the witch was not buried in the graveyard, Norman contacts classmate Salma (who tells them to access the Town Hall's archives for the location of the witch's unmarked grave) for help. As the kids make their way to the Town Hall, the zombies are attacked by the citizenry. During the riot, Norman and his companions break into the archives but cannot find the information they need. As the mob moves to attack Town Hall, the witch storm appears over the crowd. Norman climbs the Hall's tower to read the book, in a last-ditch effort to finish the ritual, but the witch strikes the book with [[lightning]], hurling Norman from the tower and deep into the archives.

Unconscious, Norman has a [[dream]] where he learns that the witch was Agatha Prenderghast, a little girl of his age who was also a medium. Norman realizes that Agatha was wrongfully convicted by the town council when they mistook her powers for [[witchcraft]]. After awakening, Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Agatha. The zombies admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual, to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Agatha's [[grave]], but is cornered by the mob. Courtney, Mitch, Neil, and Alvin rally to Norman's side and confront the crowd, arguing that their rage, fear, and misunderstanding make them no different than the cursed townsfolk from long ago. Although the mob calms down, the witch unleashes her powers to create greater havoc throughout the town.

Judge Hopkins guides Norman's family to the grave in a forest. Before the grave is reached, Agatha's [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers separate Norman from the others. Norman finds the grave and interacts with Agatha's vengeful spirit, determined to stop the cataclysmic [[tantrum]] she has been having over the years. Though she attempts to push him away Norman holds his ground, telling her that he understands how she feels as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]], that her vengeance has only made her like the ones who wronged her, and eventually forcing her to remember happier days. Having finally encountered someone who understands her plight, Agatha is able to find a measure of peace and cross over to the afterlife. The storm dissipates, and she and the zombies all fade away. The town cleans up and regards Norman as a hero. In the end, Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his grandmother and his family, who have grown to accept Norman for who he is.

==Production==
[[File:ParaNorman, Norman's faces, 3D printer.jpg|thumb|''ParaNorman'' was the first film that used full-color 3D printers for animation.]]

The idea of the film came from Chris Butler, who, realizing that the zombie films, often contained a degree of [[social commentary]], thought making such a movie for kids, could help express the challenges kids face growing up.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lambie|first1=Ryan|title=Chris Butler and Sam Fell interview: on writing and directing ParaNorman|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/paranorman/22607/chris-butler-and-sam-fell-interview-on-writing-and-directing-paranorman|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>

Production of the stop-motion animation feature took place at Laika's studio in [[Hillsboro, Oregon]].<ref name="think big">{{cite news|last=Rogoway|first=Mike|title=Laika thinks big with 'ParaNorman,' the second feature from Phil Knight's film studio|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2012/08/laika_thinks_big_with_paranorm.html|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|date=August 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Giegerich|first=Andy|title=Laika chases big dreams|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/print-edition/2012/07/13/laika-chases-big-dreams.html?page=all|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=Portland Business Journal|date=July 13, 2012}}</ref> The film was in production for three years with the animating stage of production lasting about two years, beginning in late 2009. Rather than using traditional 3D format cameras, the studio used sixty [[5D Mark II|Canon EOS 5D Mark II DSLR]] cameras to film the movie.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canon EOS 5D Mark II DSLR Cameras Help Capture the Summer Animated Feature "ParaNorman" in 3D|url=http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/about_canon?pageKeyCode=pressreldetail&docId=0901e0248061d43c|accessdate=August 19, 2012|date=August 17, 2012}}</ref> Ad agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]] created the advertising campaign for the film.<ref name="think big"/> ''ParaNorman'' is the first ever stop motion film to utilize full-color [[3D Printer|3D printers]] for replacement animation, after ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' pioneered and popularized the use of black and white 3D printers, which sped up puppet production considerably and allowed the team to make the large number of puppet faces required for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/08/17/how-3d-printing-changed-the-face-of-paranorman/|title=How 3D printing changed the face of 'ParaNorman'|author=Brian Heater|publisher=AOL|work=Engadget}}</ref> "Quite often it’s the stop-motion movies that are more out there", co-director Fell told ''[[The New York Times]]''.

"Little Ghost", a [[White Stripes]] song from their 2005 album ''[[Get Behind Me Satan]]'', plays at the end, over character cards identifying the main cast.
