==Plot==
{{Plot|date=September 2015}}
The film begins with a boy named Michael, a kid who has a crush on a beautiful girl named Jada but is always rejected because Jada is stuck with a gangster, Lorenzo ([[William L. Johnson|Johnson]]). When Michael comes close to her, he is beat up by Lorenzo and his homeboys, T-Bone and Baby Boy. But Michael is secretly involved in [[black magic]], and tries to bring a doll that he calls ''Killjoy'' to life. After he is abducted by the gangsters and brought into the woods, Michael is accidentally shot and killed by Lorenzo.

A year later, Jada is now going out with a guy named Jamal who is similar to Michael. Lorenzo is going out with a girl named Kahara, who is just like Jada. When Lorenzo leaves to have sex with her, T-Bone and Baby Boy go get ice-cream. The ice-cream man, who's dressed up like a clown really sells drugs. Baby Boy and T-Bone hop in the truck but end up in an abandoned building. They split up to find a way out. Baby Boy gets rammed into the wall by the ice-cream truck, killing him. T-Bone starts smoking pot when suddenly, it starts to burn him, and his body vanishes. His corpse ends up back to his hide-out, along with Baby Boy's. Meanwhile, Lorenzo, after having sex with Kahara, hears something outside her apartment building, and goes outside to check. He finds the ice-cream truck and opens the door, and the ice-cream man pulls him in, and ends up at the abandoned building. After finding the ice-cream man, he confronts him and shows him the (living) corpses of T-Bone and Baby Boy; after they fade away, he shoots the ice-cream man dozens of times, but the ice-cream man sucks up the bullets (a spoof of ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'') and shoots the bullets out of his mouth, killing Lorenzo.

Meanwhile, one of Jada's friends, Monique (Austin), calls Jada, telling her that some guy ([[Arthur Burghardt|Burghardt]]) came in to her room and needs them to come over. The homeless man tells them that Lorenzo killed Michael a year ago, and explains that Michael was brought back to life by the Ice Cream Man, whose real name's Killjoy, the doll Michael has, and tells them that Killjoy just killed Lorenzo, Baby Boy, and T-Bone. Then he tells them that Killjoy/Michael can be killed by Jada, because the love of a young woman can destroy the evil in the heart. Before leaving, he tells them that they have to kill the doll the spirit of the ice cream man came from, and the ice cream truck is outside.

Still not believing what the homeless man said, they go inside the ice-cream truck to check it out, and they end up in the abandoned building, where they're confronted by T-Bone, Baby Boy, and Lorenzo, who souls' are under Killjoy's control and are now his accomplices. The trio start fighting the accomplices until all three are killed. Then Killjoy comes out and knocks Jamal and Monique out. He asks Jada for a kiss, upon which Jada agrees to do so, under one condition: that he will leave her world and never come back. But instead of disappearing, Killjoy transforms into Michael. Michael tells Jada that he did it all for her. Jada, who desperately wants to stop Michael/Killjoy from killing, stabs Michael to death, and Michael fades away.

Jamal, Jada, and Monique are about to leave when Killjoy, Lorenzo, T-Bone, and Baby Boy appear behind them. Jada then remembers from the Homeless man that they have to kill the doll. The trio frantically run back into the ice-cream truck, where they end up in Michael's house, where the doll lies on the floor. The doll turns into Michael, who constantly begs her for forgiveness, but Jada continues to stab it. The earth starts to shake, and while Jada, Jamal, and Monique try to stay still within the circle of candles without breaking it, Baby Boy, T-Bone, and Lorenzo's souls are sucked into a portal. The trio then watch as Killjoy finishes off Michael (via vaporization), and the trio are sent back to Jada's room, where the homeless man thanks them, and vanishes, meaning he's an [[angel]] from heaven.

The trio decides to go out and eat, when they are confronted by Ray Jackson ([[Carl Washington|Washington]]), and Tamara (Rochelle), who are both in Jada's English class. Ray says that he gained access into the club free because his brother owns the place, and his name is......Killjoy! The trio then see that Ray turns into Killjoy, and Tamara turns into Lorenzo. Killjoy starts laughing maniacally at the trio, with Jada screaming "NO!", until Jada wakes up in bed, along with Jamal, indicating that the entire experience was all a dream. Jamal tries to calm Jada down by going under the covers to perform oral sex on her, but then rises from the covers as Killjoy. The film ends with a shot of Jada screaming and Killjoy stating, "That was some good pussay!!!", followed by evil laughter.
