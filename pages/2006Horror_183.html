==Plot==
A [[meteorite]] housing a malevolent, sentient [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial parasite]] crashes into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina. While frolicking in the woods with Brenda, local car dealer Grant finds the parasite and is infected by it. The parasite takes over his body and absorbs his mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formspring.me/VonSpears/q/169616536925928950|title=James Gunn's Formspring|publisher=}}</ref> With the alien now in control of his body, "Grant" begins to slowly change into a tentacled, slug-like monster. Many pets soon disappear but Grant is not suspected. However, his wife Starla begins to question his health; he explains the initial changes in his appearance as an allergic reaction to a bee sting, saying that a doctor has already given him something for it, but Starla soon learns this is a lie. Starla contacts the police chief Bill Pardy – her childhood crush – who attempts to reassure and comfort her while not acting on his feelings.

Grant infects the lonely and neglected Brenda and hides her in an isolated barn and feeds her raw meat to breed hundreds of alien slugs inside her. In the night, Starla is attacked by the infected Grant. Bill and the police try to shoot Grant but Grant escapes. Bill leads a small group of officers on a hunt for Grant; they find Brenda in the barn, where she has become a massive blob of flesh due to Grant's infecting her. The group barely has time to do anything before Brenda explodes, releasing hundreds of the alien slugs. Most of Bill's group are infected by the slugs and become Grant's [[Zombie (fictional)|puppets]], speaking as if they were Grant and obsessed with bringing Starla home and holding her to her wedding vows. Everyone in town is quickly eaten by others infected with Grant's offspring, or absorbed into Grant's [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady, and a teenage girl, Kylie, who had escaped from her family that were also infected by the parasites. She tells them of how she saw the slug's memories; it moves from planet to planet, eating or absorbing all life it finds there. The parasite's consciousness, however, is influenced by the real Grant's memories and his love for his wife, Starla.

The survivors try to escape detection and kill Grant. The townspeople attack their vehicle, capturing Starla and Jack. Bill and Kylie track Starla to her home, and find that the infected are melding into one giant creature. They must risk their lives to stop the infestation from spreading any further. Jack awakens in the house's basement, where several of the infected are eating; he tries to escape but becomes infected by Grant as he reaches the top of the stairs and opens the door. Starla charms the monster by calling him "Grant" and telling him they can be together, but as they get close to each other, she pulls a hairbrush handle from her underwear and stabs him in the chest with the pointed handle. He slaps her with a tentacle and knocks her across the room. Bill arrives; Jack begs to be killed, and Bill shoots him in the head. He tries to kill the monster with a grenade, but another tentacle knocks the grenade into the pool, where it detonates. The monster sends two tentacles to stab Bill and infect him the same way he infected Brenda; one is lodged in his abdomen, but Bill attaches the other to a small propane tank, filling Grant with gas, and Starla shoots the monster, causing it to explode, whereupon all the infected die. The three survivors walk away to find a hospital for Bill.

In a [[post-credits scene]], a cat approaches to feed off Grant's remains and is infected with the evil parasite.

==Themes and influences==
Controversy ensued over the many similarities and plot-points shared with [[Fred Dekker]]'s 1986 horror-comedy ''[[Night of the Creeps]]''. According to journalist Steve Palopoli:

{{blockquote|When the trailer for ''Slither'' came out, Internet boards about the movie suddenly lit up with protests from a legion of fans of the 1986 film ''Night of the Creeps''. "Alien slugs that turn people into zombies!" they cried. "What a rip-off!" I bring this up not because I think ''Slither''— which is a tongue-in-cheek pastiche of at least a dozen '80s horror films—could really be considered a rip-off of any one of them.<ref name="slither-0614.html">{{cite web | author= Steve Palopoli| title=Film Reviews & Movie Showtimes 'Slither'<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=Metro Active| date=2006-04-05 | url=http://www.metroactive.com/bohemian/04.05.06/slither-0614.html| accessdate=2009-01-03}}</ref>}}

Palopoli then goes on to directly compare ''Slither'' to the aforementioned ''Creeps'' as well as [[Shivers (film)|''Shivers'' (1975)]]. Gunn has stated that both Cronenberg's ''Shivers'' and his 1979 film ''[[The Brood]]'' were the two biggest influences on the story in ''Slither,'' along with the 2000 [[manga]] ''[[Uzumaki]]'' by [[Junji Ito]].<ref>{{cite web | author= Elaine Lamkin| title=Slither: Writer/Director James Gunn Gets Sticky

Troma co-founder [[Lloyd Kaufman]] has a cameo as a "Sad Drunk", and one scene includes a clip from the Troma film, ''[[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]]''.

In one scene, the bodies of mutilated dogs are discovered on "the Castevet's farm".  Minnie and Roman Castevet were the Satan-worshiping next-door neighbors in ''Rosemary's Baby''.

[[Paul Brooks]], president of the film's production company, [[Gold Circle Films]], said the company was "crushingly disappointed" by the gross.<ref name="holly"/> Universal distanced itself from ''Slither''{{'}}s poor box office performance, citing their distribution of the film as merely part of a deal with Gold Circle.<ref>{{cite news | author=Brandon Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2041&p=.htm | title='Ice Age 2' Hot, 'Basic Instinct 2' Not | publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | date=2006-04-03 | accessdate=2007-09-24 }}</ref>  ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' speculated that ''Slither''{{'}}s performance "might have killed off the horror-comedy genre for the near future."<ref name="holly"/> Producer Paul Brooks offered this explanation about why ''Slither'' failed to catch on with filmgoers:
{{blockquote|I think that because it was comedy-horror instead of pure horror is where the problem lay. It's the first comedy-horror in a long time, and maybe the marketplace just isn't ready for comedy-horror yet. It's difficult to think of other explanations.<ref name="holly"/>}}

Among the critics who did not like the film, [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Richard Roeper]] gave ''Slither'' a "two thumbs down" rating on their television show, with Roeper saying he was "all zombied out" after reviewing a wave of zombie-themed films from the year before.<ref>[http://tvplex.go.com/buenavista/ebertandroeper/060403.html Reviews from the Weekend of April 1–April 2, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701032558/http://tvplex.go.com/buenavista/ebertandroeper/060403.html |date=July 1, 2006 }}.
