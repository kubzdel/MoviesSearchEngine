'''''Colin''''' is a 2008 British zombie film written and directed by Marc Price. After a successful run in a number of film festivals, it went on to be shown at Cannes in 2009. Applauded for its success despite its low budget, the total cost of production was reportedly £45.<ref name="cnn"/> The director, actor and comedian Marc Price, shot ''Colin'' on a standard definition [[Panasonic]] [[mini-dv]] camcorder that he had owned for 10 years and edited the film on his home PC using [[Adobe Premiere Pro|Adobe Premiere]] 6 software which had come bundled with a video capture card he'd purchased a few years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebigpicturemagazine.com/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D115%3Afilm-making-on-a-micro-budget-an-interview-with-marc-price-director-of-colin%26catid%3D35%3Ainterviews%26Itemid%3D61 |accessdate=26 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930222645/http://thebigpicturemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=115%3Afilm-making-on-a-micro-budget-an-interview-with-marc-price-director-of-colin&catid=35%3Ainterviews&Itemid=61 |archivedate=30 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Facebook]] and [[Myspace]] were used to gather actors to play the zombies.<ref name="cnn"/>

== Plot ==
Injured in the arm, Colin arrives home to the house he shares with Damien only to find it empty. While cleaning his wound in the kitchen sink, he is attacked by Damien, now a zombie. He manages to "kill" Damien by stabbing him multiple times in the head with a kitchen knife, but soon afterwards becomes a zombie himself. Now one of the undead, Colin wanders the streets of [[London]] during the onset of a probable [[zombie apocalypse]]. He acquires the usual zombie cannibal taste for human flesh but avoids conflict. While being mugged for his [[trainers]], he is seen by Linda, his sister. That evening zombies invade a house party and kill everyone within. Colin follows the sole survivor of the carnage (who, we later discover, reminds him of Laura, his friend) before she is trapped by a madman / serial killer in his basement with a group of blinded zombies.

Linda and a friend finally capture Colin and take him to their mother's house, but Colin cannot recognize them. Linda has already been bitten by Colin when trying to save him from the muggers, and turns into a zombie, while she is reanimating she is locked in with Colin and her boyfriend and mother leave. Colin and Linda shamble away. The film also follows a cowering group of human survivors who finally go on the offensive. Led by Slingshot guy, the humans attack a large group of zombies with a makeshift grenade, which explodes near Colin, destroying most of his face. Three of the humans are bitten during the fight and are brutally killed by the rest of the group after one starts turning.

Colin survives and finds his way to his friend Laura's home, where the film cuts to a flashback to when he was still human. Arriving at the house, he discovered that Laura had trapped a zombie in the bathroom. While attempting to kill the zombie, she was bitten and died in his arms, before reanimating and biting him. He then killed her before going home, which brings the viewer back to the film's beginning.<ref>Michael Brooke: "Review: Colin:" Sight and Sound: November 2009: 19:11: 52-53</ref>

''Colin'' is the first feature film to be told entirely from a zombie's perspective from the outset, the main character Colin changes in the first few minutes of the film.<ref>http://www.horrortalk.com/reviews/Colin/colin.htm</ref> Another feature film that deals with a story from a zombie's point of view is Andrew Parkinson's ''[[I, Zombie]]'' (1998).

He commended the film's ambiance of panic, assisted by the relative intimacy of a handheld [[camcorder]] as the principal instrument of filming.
