==Plot==
{{more plot|date=April 2018}}
After being accused of crimes he did not commit, a lonely circus clown known onstage as Gurdy (Jack Amos) exacts his revenge on those who unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend, part tabloid sensationalism... he is now an unstoppable murderous juggernaut, fueled only by hate. And worse, when two tabloid reporters (Georgia Chris and Joe Davison) attempt to hunt him down, they find themselves kidnapped and trapped in his warehouse, hunted by him and his conniving daughter ([[Raine Brown]]), who already has a deceptive plan up her sleeve. It's a gory, horrifying fight for their lives with no telling who will emerge alive.
