'''''Requiem''''' is a 2006 German drama film directed by [[Hans-Christian Schmid]]. It stars [[Sandra Hüller]] as a woman with epilepsy, Michaela Klingler, believed by members of her church and herself to be possessed. The film steers clear of special effects or dramatic music and instead presents documentary-style filmmaking, which focuses on Michaela's struggle to lead a normal life, trapped in a limbo which could either represent demonic possession or mental illness, focusing on the latter.

The film focuses on the medical condition ([[epilepsy]]) as seen in the real-life events of [[Anneliese Michel]], a German woman who was believed to have been possessed by six or more demons and died in 1976.<ref name="Washington Post">{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/02/AR2005090200559.html| title = What in God's Name?!|work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate =5 December 2016 | first=Eric T. | last=Hansen | date=4 September 2005}}</ref> These events also served as the basis of [[Scott Derrickson]]'s 2005 film ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]''.
