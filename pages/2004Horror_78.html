==Censorship==
In comparison with the theatrical cut of the film, the 'R' rated DVD version was missing approximately 22 minutes.<ref>[http://www.frightflix.com/ Fright Flix Productions, Inc. - Murder-Set-Pieces]</ref> Most of the cuts were to obtain the 'R' rating and removed several intense scenes of sexualized violence and torture, however, some scenes were also removed by the director himself which he intended to edit out of the film before going into theaters but never got the chance.<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0107/p14s01-almo.html Christian Science Monitor - David Sterritt]</ref>

===UK ban===
The film was submitted for release in the [[United Kingdom]] to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) who refused to give the film an '18' certificate, therefore making the film illegal to supply within the UK. The BBFC stated they rejected the film because of sexual violence, and the film was potentially breaking UK obscenity laws.<ref>http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/murder-set-pieces-1970</ref>

{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
The film received generally negative reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 36% of 11 reviews were positive, with an average rating of 3.7/10.<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|murder_set_pieces|Murder-Set-Pieces}} Retrieved February 18, 2014.</ref> On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 13 out of 100 rating, based on 5 critics, signifying "overwhelming dislike".<ref>{{metacritic film|murder-set-pieces|Murder-Set-Pieces}} Retrieved February 18, 2014.</ref>

Debra Birnbaum of the ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote it "aspires to be a highly stylized exploration of the mind of a serial killer, but it's nothing more than a gory, blood-soaked snuff film, reveling in its own shock value."<ref>{{cite news |last=Birnbaum |first=Debra |date=January 7, 2005 |title=Awful Murder Flick Not Worth Film It's Shot On |url=https://nypost.com/2005/01/07/awful-murder-flick-not-worth-film-its-shot-on/ |newspaper=New York Post |access-date=October 19, 2015}}</ref>

Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film evinced "only the slightest interest in narrative or character," and "distinguishes itself via sheer extremity of gore, sadism and tastelessness", and that its "nastiness is so insistent, one-dimensional and excessive it risks self-parody."<ref name=VarietyHarvey/>

Ben Kenigsberg of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it "a movie so utterly degenerate it makes you wish that indie filmmakers had to prove a basic standard of decency in order to buy a camera."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kenigsberg |first1=Ben|title=Tracking Shots: Murder-Set-Pieces |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0501,kenigsberg,59780,20.html |accessdate=October 19, 2015 |work=Village Voice |date=January 4, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105160109/http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0501,kenigsberg,59780,20.html |archivedate=January 5, 2005}}</ref>

However, Heidi Martinuzzi of ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave it four stars out of four, calling it "incredibly good" and "well made."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Martinuzzi |first1=Heidi |title=Murder-Set-Pieces |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/6643/ |website=[[Film Threat]] |accessdate=October 19, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919163613/http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/6643/ |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |date=January 18, 2005}}</ref>
