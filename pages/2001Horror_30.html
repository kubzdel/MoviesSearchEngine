'''''The Devil's Backbone''''' ({{lang-es|'''El espinazo del diablo'''}}) is a 2001 [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Guillermo del Toro]], and written by del Toro, [[David Muñoz (director)|David Muñoz]], and [[Antonio Trashorras]]. It was [[Independent film|independently produced]] by [[Pedro Almodóvar]] as an international co-production between Spain and Mexico, and was filmed in [[Madrid]].

The film is set in Spain, 1939, during the final year of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The film was released to very positive reviews from critics and audiences.

==Plot==
Casares ([[Federico Luppi]]) and Carmen ([[Marisa Paredes]]) operate a small home for orphans in a remote part of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Helping the couple mind the orphanage are Jacinto ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), the groundskeeper, and Conchita (Irene Visedo), a teacher who is also involved with Jacinto. Casares and Carmen are aligned with the Republican loyalists, and are hiding a large cache of gold that is used to back the Republican treasury; perhaps not coincidentally, the orphanage has also been subject to attacks from [[Francisco Franco]]'s troops, and a defused bomb sits in the home's courtyard.

One day, a boy named Carlos (Fernando Tielve) arrives at the home with two [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|republicans]], they both ask Casares and Carmen to take him in because his father died fighting the [[fascists]]. Casares and Carmen take him in, and the boy soon strikes up an unlikely friendship with Jaime (Íñigo Garcés), a boy with a reputation for tormenting other kids. But Carlos soon begins having visions of a mysterious apparition he can't identify, and hears strange stories about a child named Santi who went missing the day the bomb appeared near the orphanage.

==Cast==
* Fernando Tielve as Carlos, an orphan. He is described by del Toro in the DVD commentary as a force of [[innocence]]. Tielve had originally auditioned as an extra before [[Guillermo del Toro|del Toro]] decided to cast him as the lead. This was his film debut. Both Tielve and his co-star Iñigo Garcés had cameos as guerrilla soldiers in ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''.
* Íñigo Garcés as Jaime, the orphanage bully who later befriends Carlos.
* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Jacinto, the caretaker.
* [[Marisa Paredes]] as Carmen, the administrator of the orphanage.
* [[Federico Luppi]] as Dr. Casares, the orphanage doctor.
* Junio Valverde as Santi, an orphan who becomes a [[ghost]].
* Irene Visedo as Conchita, Jacinto's [[fiancée]].

==Production==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
The film was an international co-production between Spain and Mexico.<ref name=criterion />

Del Toro wrote the first draft before writing his debut film ''[[Cronos (film)|Cronos]]''. This "very different" version was set in the [[Mexican Revolution]] and focused not on a child's ghost but a "Christ with three arms".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rjeFG130Mg|title=Guillermo del Toro Q&A at Hero Complex Film Festival 2013|work=youtube.com|date=May 12, 2013|accessdate=May 24, 2013}}</ref> According to del Toro, and as drawn in his notebooks, there were many iterations of the story, some of which included antagonists who were a "doddering ... old man with a needle," a "desiccated" ghost with black eyes as a caretaker (instead of the living Jacinto who terrorizes the orphans), and "beings who are red from head to foot."<ref name="CoC">{{cite book|last1=del Toro|first1=Guillermo|title=Cabinet of Curiosities: My Notebooks, Collections, and Other Observations|date=2013|publisher=Insight Editions/Harper Collins|isbn=9780062082848|pages=102, 103, 105|edition=1st}}</ref>

As to motivation for the villain, according to the actor who portrayed him (Eduardo Noriega), Jacinto "suffered a lot when he was a child at this orphanage. Somebody probably treated him wickedly: this is his heritage. And then there is the brutalizing effect of the War." Noriega further notes that "What Guillermo did was to write a biography of Jacinto (which went into Jacinto's parents, what they did in life, and more) and gave it to me."<ref name="GDT">{{cite book|last1=Noreiga|first1=Eduardo|editor1-last=Olson|editor1-first=Danel|title=Guillermo del Toro's _The Devil's Backbone_ & _Pan's Labyrinth_: Studies in the Horror Film|date=2015|publisher=Centipede Press|location=Lakewood, CO|isbn=9781613471012|pages=269–280|edition=1st|chapter=Interview}}</ref>

DDT Studios in Barcelona created the final version of the crying ghost (victim and avenger) Santi, with his temple that resembled cracked, aged porcelain.<ref name="CoC" />

==Reception==
The response was overwhelmingly positive, though it did not receive the critical success that ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' would in 2006. [[Roger Ebert]] compared it favorably to ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'', another ghost story released later in the same year.<ref name="ebert">Ebert, Roger (December 21, 2001). [http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20011221/REVIEWS/112210302/1023 The Devil's Backbone  (review).] ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''</ref> Christopher Varney, of ''[[Film Threat]]'', claimed: "That 'The Devil's Backbone' makes any sense at all — with its many, swirling plotlines — seems like a little wonder." [[A.O. Scott]], of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, and claimed that "The director, Guillermo del Toro, balances dread with tenderness, and refracts the terror and sadness of the time through the eyes of a young boy, who only half-understands what he is witnessing."<ref name="aoscott">Scott, A.O. (November 21, 2001). ''[[The New York Times]]''. [https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/244107/The-Devil-s-Backbone/overview The Devil's Backbone (review overview).]</ref>

The film was #61 on [[Bravo (US TV network)|Bravo]]'s ''100 Scariest Movie Moments'' for its various scenes in which the ghost is seen. It currently holds a 92% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|devils_backbone|The Devil's Backbone}}</ref> [[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film at number eighteen in their list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article calling the film "elegant and deeply-felt... it’s alternately a gut-wrenching portrait of childhood in a time of war and a skin-crawling, evocative nightmare."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 4|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03}}</ref> The film has been described as a humanist ghost story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krake|first=Kate|title=Guillermo del Toro’s The Devil’s Backbone – A Humanist Ghost Story|url=http://www.guessingtales.com/guillermo-del-toros-the-devils-backbone-a-humanist-ghost-story//|publisher=Guessing Tales|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>
