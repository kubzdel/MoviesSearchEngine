{{nihongo|'''''Kakurenbo: Hide & Seek'''''|カクレンボ|Kakurenbo|lit. "Hide and Seek"}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[Cel-shaded animation|cel-shaded]] [[anime]] [[short film]] written and directed by [[Shuhei Morita]].

The film entails a game of {{nihongo|"Otokoyo"|オトコヨ||lit. Man Hunt}}, a version of [[hide and seek]] played by children, wearing fox masks, near the ruins of an abandoned old [[Kowloon Walled City|Kowloon-inspired]] city. The children who play this disappear, believed to be [[Kamikakushi|spirited away]] by demons. ''Kakurenbo'' follows Hikora, a boy who joins the game with hopes of finding his missing sister, Sorincha. The storyline is built on the idea that Tokyo is losing its ''natural'' aesthetic, which includes child's games such as hide and seek in order for industrial progress to ensue i.e. lighting the city of Tokyo costing innocence of childhood games.

=== Demons ===
Once the seven children pass through the gates to enter the abandoned streets, they are pursued by four different demons and then finally by the one demon who is "it".<ref>In Japan, the [[Tag (game)|game of tag]] is known as {{nihongo|Onigokko|鬼ごっこ}}, where the person who is "it" is the "[[Oni (folklore)|Oni]]".</ref> They guard the battery tower within the center of the city, where every child they catch is taken to be used as power cells for the city. The tower has socket rows that go on to the very first children who played.
