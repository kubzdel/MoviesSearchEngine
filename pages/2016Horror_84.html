==Plot==
John Wayne Cleaver, a teenager in a small [[Midwestern]] town, has been diagnosed as a [[sociopath]] and suffers  homicidal impulses. These are exacerbated by working at his mother April's funeral home. He controls his urges with rules, mental stopgaps, and speaking to his therapist, Grant. Near a recent murder victim's body, John sees a puddle of black oil. After an identical murder, talk of a serial killer piques John's interest. While out trick-or-treating with his friend Max, John spots a drifter lurking outside his neighbor Bill Crowley's house. At the high-school Halloween dance, John scares off a bully by threatening to kill him.

After discussing this with Grant, John sees the drifter join Crowley on an ice fishing trip, and John follows them. As the drifter is about to attack Crowley, Crowley suddenly kills the man with his bare hand, which morphs into a branch-like shape. Crowley cuts out his own lungs and replaces them with the man's. John creates a serial killer profile, noting every victim had organs removed. While following Crowley and his wife, Kay, on their date night, he comes across his mother and Grant having dinner, upsetting John. John studies fairytales and mystic folklore, and the police connect the recent murders to a missing person named Emmett Openshaw.

John follows Crowley to a barbershop owned by Greg, a man who danced with Kay the previous night because Crowley was limping. After seeing Crowley attack Greg, John impulsively sets off the barbershop's alarm, drawing two police officers, who Crowley kills. Afterward, Crowley no longer limps and appears to be rejuvenated. Before leaving, Crowley nonchalantly answers a phone call from Kay. John sees a puddle of black oil and realizes it was Crowley's old leg, which he swapped with Greg's.

After leaving Crowley an anonymous note revealing his knowledge, John overhears Kay say Crowley has been housebound for a week. As John visits Crowley at Kay's request, Crowley recites and explains [[William Blake]]'s poems "[[The Lamb]]" and "[[The Tyger]]". John continues to profile Crowley, who grows weaker. On Christmas Eve, John calls Crowley from a pay phone to ask about the process and what he stole from Openshaw. Crowley gives vague answers, and John realizes Crowley was stalling. Seeing Crowley's car, John flees to Max's house. After John reveals their friendship was merely a coping mechanism, Max throws out John. John stumbles upon Crowley killing Max's father; John, wearing a ski mask, fails to stop Crowley and flees.

After Max's father's memorial, April tries to connect with John, who threatens her life when she pushes him. After a conversation with Grant, John waits until Crowley leaves the house and tries to scare him away by threatening what he loves most: Kay. When John believes he has unintentionally killed Kay, he panics and calls Grant. After seeing she is still alive, John leaves the house as Crowley arrives. In Crowley's car, he finds Grant's intact body, which he hides. The next morning, Crowley realizes John has taken the body. At Max's father's funeral, Crowley reveals Grant had been out looking for John. John says Crowley will not try anything in public and observes that Crowley's heart will not last much longer.

After the funeral, John realizes his mother did not leave; he finds her unconscious on the embalming table beside Crowley, who demands John return Grant's body. John pretends to agree but knocks out Crowley. After April regains consciousness, they hook Crowley up to the embalming device. When Crowley wakes, the lights flicker, and a large, black, oily monster slides out of his body. Realizing he can no longer be with Kay, he asks John to watch over her and commits suicide. Both Crowley and the monster's corpses melt into black oil. Afterwards, the police find Grant's body, and Crowley is reported missing. John comforts Kay, who tells him the story of how she and Bill fell in love, making John realize he must find happiness, too. John and his mother later have a casual conversation as they embalm Grant's body.
