'''''Offspring''''' is a 2009 [[horror film]] directed by Andrew van den Houten. The film centers on survivors of a feral flesh-eating clan who abduct locals. It is based on the novel of the same name by Jack Ketchum, which is itself the sequel to ''[[Off Season (novel)|Off Season]]''. Pollyanna McIntosh reprises her role in the sequel, ''[[The Woman (2011 film)|The Woman]]''. Before he began to direct the film, a friend of van den Houten's specifically requested that he keep The Woman alive so she could appear in a sequel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucky McKee, Jack Ketchum & Andrew van den Houten Discuss 'THE WOMAN'|url=http://chuckpalahniuk.net/interviews/lucky-mckee-jack-ketchum-andrew-van-den-houten-discuss-the-woman|publisher=Chuck Palahniuk|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> The cannibals in this film speak a language of grunts which is subtitled for the viewer.<ref>{{cite web|title=OFFSPRING: The prequel that set the path for The Woman|url=http://horrorcultfilms.co.uk/2011/10/offspring-the-prequel-that-set-the-path-for-the-woman/|publisher=Horror Cult Films|accessdate=1 July 2016}}</ref> This did not happen in the sequel, as it only contains one of them.
