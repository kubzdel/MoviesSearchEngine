'''''Aversion''''' is a 2009 [[horror film]] about a [[private investigator]] who discovers too late that the woman he is hired to follow is often possessed by a demon.

Under the direction of GF Roberts the original script, written by Roberts and Ted Spencer, combines [[demonic possession]] with [[science fiction]]. The film is somewhat retro in nature because it was shot on [[photographic film]] and that over ninety percent of the effects are in camera. The tone of Aversion differs from many contemporary movies by providing some [[comic relief]] throughout.

The on-set [[special effects]] were provided by Monster in My Closet FX under the supervision of Jeremy Selenfriend. Other crew members included assistant director Sabrina Simone, Jared Noe and D Garcia.

==Plot==
This original story marries three different elements into one plot.

Alex Stokes (Andrew Roth) is a self-destructive, down-on-his-luck investigator who takes cases wherever he can. When a mysterious man offers him a healthy sum to follow his beautiful wife Claire (Melantha Blackthorne), Alex can't resist. Her seemingly mundane day-to-day activities take a strange turn when she tries to kill herself. 

After saving her, their chemistry proves too much to resist and they become romantically entangled. But the fun has just begun as her [[demonic possession]]s escalate and Alex's entire town gets sucked into a [[vortex]] of [[evil]]. Can one lost soul get it together in time to save mankind?

The movie is considered a [[film noir]] because it involves a self-destructive, down-and-out investigator who takes on a case that may be more than he can handle. Incorporating standard elements like a beautiful woman, excessive drinking and subtle [[voiceover]], the piece is set up like a standard detective film.

==Production==

===Casting===
Quite a few casting sessions were held and there was always one outstanding actor for every role. Fortunately, when offers were made, no one turned down the roles, so essentially a dream cast was assembled.

===Direction===
GF Roberts has been shooting [[independent film]] in [[New York City]] for years. His projects range from comedy to horror and film to music videos. Starting with short films shot on [[video]] with his friends, Roberts discovered that he had a knack for telling stories with the camera. Years later, after scripting a feature film, which was produced, he joined the production team and never looked back. He began shooting film-based projects and after investing in equipment began his own production company. From there he learned the workings of the camera and after sufficient experience he hired himself out as a [[cinematographer]], working on several films. He has also shot [[music videos]] and a spec television show. He recently completed “The Citizen Core”, which was an official selection in the Philadelphia Independent Film Festival and Sarah’s Demons, a horror short was an official selection in the 2008 [[Bare Bones International Film Festival]].

===Filming locations===
The movie's opening scene was shot in Pennsylvania. The interrogation scenes were shot in Brooklyn. The bulk of the film though, was shot in upstate New York, mainly [[Woodstock, New York]], the infamous site of the 1969 concert, [[Kingston, New York]] and [[Red Hook, NY]]. Although the film has various locations, it is not supposed to take place anywhere specific.
