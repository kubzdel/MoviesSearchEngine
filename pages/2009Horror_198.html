==Plot summary==
A former drug user, Jenny (Rebecca Pitkin) finds herself constantly struggling to find acceptance and love from her divorced parents, neither of whom truly want her around. Her mother's boyfriend even goes so far as to use Jenny's room as storage, which makes Jenny have to live in the basement after her father sends her back to her mother's house. Jenny tries to become more independent by getting a job and moving in with her boyfriend Rick (Luke Harris). This arrangement is short lived, as the two end up breaking up over Kate (Laura O'Donoughue), a young girl that is obsessed with Rick. As a result Jenny is pushed further into the arms of Ed, a co-worker that she had become extremely close to. However what the viewer soon learns is that Ed and Kate are both individually involved in the occult and that Kate has cast several spells with the intent to harm others. Eventually Kate manages to convince Rick to assist her in casting a spell that would make Jenny's life miserable.
