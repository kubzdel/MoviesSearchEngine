When [[protagonist]] Derek Washington (Hall) was just a child, he witnessed his father's murder.  Because of this, he became very afraid of blood.  However, when a sting operation to find a counterfeiter named Gustoff Slovak ([[Mel Novak]]) goes wrong, Derek is forced to face his fear: blood. The operation backfires, resulting in a massacre that leaves Derek's team wiped out. Derek reaches the shocking conclusion that Slovak is actually a [[vampire]], and joins forces with a weapons expert named Master Kao ([[Gerald Okamura]]).
