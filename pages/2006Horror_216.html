'''''When a Stranger Calls'''''  is a 2006 American [[horror film]] directed by [[Simon West]] and written by Jake Wade Wall. The film stars [[Camilla Belle]], [[Brian Geraghty]], [[Katie Cassidy]] in her film debut and [[Clark Gregg]]. Belle plays a babysitter who starts to receive threatening phone calls from an unidentified stranger, played by both [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] and [[Lance Henriksen]]. The film is a remake of [[Fred Walton (director)|Fred Walton]]'s [[When a Stranger Calls (1979 film)|1979 horror film of the same name]] which became a [[cult classic]] for its legendary opening 20 minutes which this remake extended to a feature-length film.

The film was theatrically released on February 3, 2006, and received generally negative reviews from critics. It grossed over $66.9 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.

==Plot==
On one side of town, a babysitter and the kids she is babysitting are brutally murdered outside a funfair. The police find that the murderer used his bare hands to tear them to shreds. The shot then changes to teenager Jill Johnson ([[Camilla Belle]]), who is going through a teenage crisis at high school: having her boyfriend, Bobby ([[Brian Geraghty]]), cheat on her with her best friend Tiffany ([[Katie Cassidy]]) and going over 800 minutes on her cell phone for which her father Ben ([[Clark Gregg]]), has her babysit for a wealthy family to pay off the debt causing Jill to be grounded for one month. The unfortunate timing causes Jill to miss out on a school [[bonfire]], which her other best friend, Scarlett ([[Tessa Thompson]]), is attending. Jill arrives at the elaborate Mandrakis House in Elan Valley, which has a [[greenhouse]] built in the center. It houses many birds and has a pool containing several fish. The parents ([[Derek de Lint]] and [[Kate Jennings Grant]]), show her around and tell her about their live-in housemaid Rosa Ramirez (Rosine Ace Hatem). Mrs. Mandrakis then gives Jill their numbers, stating that they won't be back until midnight. As the kids ([[Arthur Young (actor born 1995)|Arthur Young]] and [[Madeline Carroll]]) are seen to be upstairs asleep, Jill soon begins to receive anonymous phone calls.

Tiffany visits but Jill, fearing in getting into further trouble, asks her to leave. However, a tree branch, knocked down by the storm outside, blocks the road near the gate. When Tiffany gets out to move the broken branch, she is apparently attacked by an unknown figure. The calls continue, each one becoming more alarming, suggesting she is being watched. Jill calls the police, who tell her they can trace the calls if she is able to keep him on the line for one minute. While waiting for the phone to ring, Jill sees a shadow moving in the guesthouse. She goes there to investigate, but finds that the guest house is empty. After seeing a light switch on in the house, Jill quickly makes her way back to the main house. She then starts upstairs toward the maid's room when the phone rings again. The unknown stalker continues to remain quiet on the other end as Jill tries to keep him talking for 60 seconds so the call can be traced by the police. As Jill opens the door to the maid's room, where she hears the shower running, she asks the man on the phone "What do you want?!". He replies "Your blood.....all over me". As Jill hangs up instantly, the police call back right away telling her that the calls are coming from inside the house. The phone disconnects as Jill hears another phone ringing in the bathroom. She turns and finds Tiffany dead on the bathroom floor with her cell phone right next to her. Jill shrieks with terror to see her friend dead.

As Jill collects the Mandrakis children, she looks up to see the stranger looking down at her from the loft. Jill and the children run into the [[greenhouse]]. Jill discovers the housemaid Rosa dead inside the pool as the attacker breaks in. They quickly escape and Jill manages to lock the man inside the greenhouse, but he finds another way out and attacks her. During the ensuing struggle, Jill manages to burn the man's back with the fireplace and then stab him in the hand with an iron fireplace poker, before rushing out of the house into the arms of an Elan Valley police officer.

As the injured stranger is taken by the police, his face is shown by the moonlight staring at her. While recuperating, Jill awakens in the hospital and the phone rings. She lets it ring, worrying that the horrific events will reoccur. She waits for a time and leaves the phone ringing, the camera pans to her reflection in the mirror, revealing the stranger to be behind her. The man grabs Jill, who shrieks hysterically, waking her [[hallucination]] and finding herself still in the hospital while yelling that "he's in the house". The film ends with the doctors and her dad desperately trying to stop her frantic panicking, while the screen fades to black and the movie ends.

{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
[[Evan Rachel Wood]] was offered Jill Johnson's role, but turned it down. Camilla Belle was then approached and almost turned the role down due to her personal dislike for horror films but Simon West convinced her that he was going more for a psychological thriller and so she accepted. To prepare for her role Belle had to do two months of weight-training and learning how to run. Belle was injured twice on the set, she struck a wooden bridge cutting and scarring her hand and also slammed her head against a glass window.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Distribution==
For the release of the film, [[AOL Instant Messenger]] ran ads beckoning users to IM Jill020306. When messaged, "Jill" (a [[Colloquis]]-style program) made small talk before panicking, as she received calls from a stranger asking her to check the children. She then gives the user her phone number (a toll-free 877 number) and asks them to call her. When users call, they hear an ad for the movie.
Also, around the time of the DVD release, a new screen name appeared, Jill051606, to tie in with the DVD release date on May 16, 2006. It does not involve calling her, but instead she directs users to a video security system on the official DVD site where the shadow of the stranger passes by frequently.

MySpace ran an advertisement: the profile for Jill051606, in which users can add the profile as a friend, leave comments, and read Jill's blog.

===Home media===
The movie was released on May 16, 2006 on [[DVD]]. Special features include two audio commentaries (one with Camilla Belle and Simon West; the other with Jake Wade Wall), [[deleted scene]]s, a 20-minute making-of featurette, and trailers. A [[Blu-ray]] version of the film was released for the first time by [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] on October 4, 2016 in a triple feature with [[I Know What You Did Last Summer]] and [[Vacancy (film)|Vacancy]].
