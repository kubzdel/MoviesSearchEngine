'''''The Call of Cthulhu''''' is a 2005 independent [[silent film]] adaptation of the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] short story "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]", produced by Sean Branney and [[Andrew Leman]] and distributed by the [[H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society]]. It is the first [[film adaptation]] of the famous Lovecraft story, and uses Mythoscope, a blend of vintage and modern filming techniques intended to produce the look of a 1920s-era film. The film is the length of a [[featurette]].

==Plot==
The film adheres very closely to Lovecraft's story, but there are a few changes. The sailors aboard the ''Emma'' first encounter the ''Alert'' abandoned at sea, rather than crewed by [[Cthulhu]] cultists and taken over by ''Emma''{{'}}s crew after a violent confrontation as in the original story. Additionally, the film depicts the narrator present at the time of his great-uncle's death, who dies peacefully in his sleep, rather than being summoned upon the mysterious death of his great-uncle, who was presumably killed by Cthulhu cultists in the original short story. The narrator (Matt Foyer) notes that Inspector Legrasse, who had directed the raid on cultists in backwoods [[Louisiana]], died before the narrator's investigation began.

In the original story, the narrator does not seem to end in a lunatic asylum or experience any mysterious nightmares himself.

==Production==
{{unsourced section|date=April 2015}}
Early on in production, Branney and Leman decided to film it as a [[black-and-white]] film. The official site says this was done to show what the film would have looked like had it been made in 1926, when the story was first published.  In the DVD commentary the producers admit that shooting in black and white provided many other benefits. When using black-and-white [[cinematography]], a filmmaker does not need to pay particular attention to the materials and decoration of sets, as the colors will not appear in the final product.

==Release==
''The Call of Cthulhu'' has been selected to appear at numerous [[film festival]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cthulhulives.org/cocmovie/festivals.html|title=The Call of Cthulhu - an HPLHS Motion Picture|work=cthulhulives.org|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207071948/http://www.cthulhulives.org/cocmovie/festivals.html|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=}}</ref> including the 2006 [[Slamdance Film Festival]] and North America's largest, the 2006 [[Seattle International Film Festival]], where it sold out both screenings thanks in part to a glowing review from [[The Stranger (newspaper)|''The Stranger'']], a local paper.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Despite the long-standing conventional wisdom that this story was inherently "unfilmable",<ref>[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70093 Sundance: The Good, Bad and Ugly]</ref> the film garnered mostly positive reception from genre reviewers. It holds 100% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average rating of  7.1/10  based on 6 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Call of Cthulhu (1969)- Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_call_of_cthulhu_1969|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Paul di Filippo of ''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'' called it "the best HPL adaptation to date", labeling the decision to adapt it as a silent film "a brilliant conceit".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue451/screen2.html |title=Syfy|work=Syfy|accessdate=15 April 2015}}</ref>

In their book ''Lurker in the Lobby: The Guide to the Cinema of H. P. Lovecraft'', Andrew Migliore and John Strysik write: "''The Call of Cthulhu'' is a landmark adaptation that calls out to all Lovecraftian film fanatics â€” from its silent film form, its excellent cast, its direction, and its wonderful musical score... this is Cthulhuian cinema that [[H. P. Lovecraft|Howard]] would have loved."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Migliore |first1=Andrew |last2=Strysik |first2=John |title=Lurker in the Lobby: A Guide to the Cinema of H. P.
