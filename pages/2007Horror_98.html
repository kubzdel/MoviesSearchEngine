'''''Fire Serpent''''' is a 2007 [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] [[monster movie]] directed by [[John Terlesky]].

==Plot==
A [[solar flare]] from the sun sends a serpentine alien composed of fire to Earth where it begins to wreak havoc throughout a small community. During its search for more fuel to consume it stumbles upon a large military oil reserve. It soon becomes clear that an old man may hold the key to destroying it in the form of a Halogen Gun which may be used as a makeshift fire extinguisher of sorts. A small group of citizens decides to use this technology to make a stand against the creature only to face additional resistance from the beast, as well as a government employer who voluntarily helps the snake because he believes it is the spirit of a god.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}
David Cornelius from [[DVD Talk]] gave the film a negative review, writing, "''Fire Serpent'' is a wretched sci-fi/horror mess, with laughable CGI effects, an empty plot, and zero suspense. (In other words, it's your run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi Channel production. Zing!) It's the kind of B picture that fails not because it's cheap, but because it's terminally dull."<ref name="cornelius07">{{cite web|last1=Cornelius|first1=David|title=Fire Serpent : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/29331/fire-serpent/|website=DVD Talk.com|publisher=David Cornelius|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> Jon Condit from [[Dread Central]] awarded the film a negative score of 1 out of five, calling it "dull".<ref name="condit07">{{cite web|last1=Condit|first1=Jon|title=Fire Serpent (2007) - Dread Central|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/4625/fire-serpent-2007/|website=Dread Central.com|publisher=Jon Condit|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>
