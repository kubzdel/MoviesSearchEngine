She innocently provides all of her information to the other driver ([[Bill Sage]]). When Hilary returns home, her parents are angry at her, though the stranger rear-ended her. As a result, they go on holiday without her, leaving her alone and vulnerable. Hilary invites her friends, Rachel and Erik, over and receives a text from the stranger. She has unwittingly become the next victim as the mysterious driver stalks her suburban home later that stormy night while Erik, Rachel, and she defend themselves. Complicating matters is Hilary’s ex-boyfriend, who appears on the doorstep drunk.

==Reception==
Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed stated that he was “expecting almost nothing and was shocked at how effective it was in the end. It’s a solid stalk and chase slasher film mixing “[[Death Proof]]” and “[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]” and director Pavia delivers a strong genre entry suitable for a lazy Friday night and some beers.“ <ref>Vasquez Jr., Felix. June 06, 2016. Fender Bender (2016). Cinema-crazed.com. Retrieved 2016-07-19</ref> Matt Donato of We Got This Covered  was more lukewarm indicating that although “Makenzie Vega asserts herself as a future genre star,” “filmmaker Mark Pavia dilutes an original idea with stale, musty slasher generics that have been dominating too many of my reviews lately.  A select few moments shine – mostly involving gnarly gore effects – but the sum of this creepy driver’s rampage is nothing but a bland home invasion/slasher wannabe told through a weak, timid voice.” <ref>Donato, Matt. Fender Bender Review.wegotthiscovered.com. Retrieved 2016-07-19</ref> Jake Dee of The [[Joblo.com|Joblo Network]] rates the film a 5 out of 10 citing lack of originality and “over-trampled” “[[Halloween (1978 film)|''Halloween'']]-like tropes”as drawbacks while redemption comes in the slick pacing and ever increasing gore and violence culminating in its avoidance of a pat Hollywood ending which “make the movie a bit better than perhaps it should be.” <ref>Dee, Jake. June 03, 2016. Fender Bender Movie Review joblo.com. Retrieved 2016-07-19</ref>
