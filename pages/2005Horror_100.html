Felix Vasquez from ''Cinema Crazed.com'' gave the film a mostly positive review, commending the film's strong performances, writing, "Jeffery Lando’s monster mash is firmly entrenched in the schlock arena, it’s a guiltless and shameless piece of exploitation that is so based around the sexy female cast, even the bugs want to strip them naked and mount them."<ref name="vasquez11">{{cite web|last1=Vasquez|first1=Felix|title=Insecticidal (2005)|url=http://cinema-crazed.com/blog/2011/02/03/insecticidal-2005/|website=Cinema Crazed.com|publisher=Felix Vasquez|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref> ''Popcorn Pictures'' awarded the film a score of 6/10, writing, "A guilty pleasure if there was one, Insecticidal is the silly tonic fans need to down after they’ve sat through the never-ending dreck that the Sci-Fi Channel has been churning out lately. Now who wants to fund me a couple of grand to make Babes Versus Bugs?"<ref name="popcornpics">{{cite web|title=Insecticidal (2005)|url=http://www.popcornpictures.co.uk/insecticidal-2005/|website=Popcorn Pictures.co.uk|publisher=Popcorn Pictures|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>
