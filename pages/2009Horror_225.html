'''''The Uninvited''''' is a 2009 American [[psychological horror|psychological horror film]] directed by the [[Guard Brothers]], and starring [[Emily Browning]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Arielle Kebbel]] and [[David Strathairn]]. It is a [[remake]] of the 2003 [[Cinema of South Korea|South Korean]] [[K-Horror]] film ''[[A Tale of Two Sisters]]'', which is in turn one of several film adaptations of the Korean folk tale [[Janghwa Hongryeon jeon]]. The film received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
Anna ([[Emily Browning]]) has been in a [[psychiatric institution]] for ten months, following her [[suicide attempt]] after her terminally ill mother died in a [[boathouse]] fire. Upon her discharge, she has [[Memory repression#Amnesia for trauma or abuse|no memory]] of the event but frequently has related nightmares. While packing, Anna is startled by a disturbing, talkative patient from the room across the hall. Shortly after, she leaves with her father, Steven ([[David Strathairn]]), a writer who has dedicated his latest book to Anna and her sister.

At home, Anna reunites with her sister, Alex ([[Arielle Kebbel]]), with whom she is very close. The sisters stand against Steven's girlfriend Rachel ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), who had been their mother's [[live-in nurse]]. Alex criticizes Steven for sleeping with Rachel while the girls' mother was still alive and sick in bed but he does not respond. Anna describes to Alex how scenes from her dreams have started happening while she is awake. The sisters become convinced that the hallucinations are messages from their mother, telling them that she was murdered by Rachel.

Anna catches up with her old boyfriend, Matt ([[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]]), who tells her that he saw what happened the night of the fire. They secretly planned to meet that night, but Matt fails to show up and Anna returns home. In her room, Anna awakens to find him climbing into her window, saying that she needs to know the truth and that he had a warning from her mother. They kiss but then Anna notices Matt's body suddenly warping and his back breaking. Anna flees from the room in fear but when she opens the door, he is gone. The next morning, Matt's dead body is pulled out of the water, his back broken. The police assume he fell and drowned.

The sisters are unable to find a record of Rachel with the [[List of nursing organizations#State Nursing Boards|State Nursing Association]] and conclude she is actually Mildred Kemp, a nanny who killed the three children she looked after because she had an obsession with their widowed father. They try to warn their father, but he ignores their concerns and leaves for work. The girls try to gather evidence against Rachel to show the police but Rachel catches them and sedates Alex. Anna escapes and goes to the local police station, but they do not believe her claims and call Rachel, who sedates Anna and takes her home.

As Rachel puts a disoriented Anna in bed, Anna sees Alex in the doorway with a knife and then passes out. She wakes to find that Alex has killed Rachel and thrown her body into a dumpster. As the girls comfort each other, a horrified Steven arrives and asks what happened. Anna explains that Rachel tried to murder her and her sister but Alex saved their lives by killing Rachel. Steven is confused; he explains that Alex died in the fire along with her mother. Anna then notices that she is not holding her sister's hand, but the bloody knife used to murder Rachel. 

Anna finally remembers what happened on the night of the fire. After catching her father and Rachel having sex, Anna became enraged and filled a watering can from a large gasoline tank in the boathouse, intending to set them and the house on fire. She did not close the tap properly and a trail of gasoline was ignited by a falling candle. Her mother and Alex were killed in the resulting explosion. Flashbacks reveal that Anna had been hallucinating Alex since she left the institution. She remembers killing Matt—who did show up at their planned meeting—by letting him fall and break his back. She also remembers killing Rachel, who was surprisingly a kinder person than she had imagined.

As the police arrest Anna for murder, Steven is questioned by an officer. He explains that Rachel changed her name years ago to escape an abusive boyfriend. 

At the institution, Anna is welcomed back by the patient across the hall that scared her earlier; the name plate on her door reads "Mildred Kemp".

==Development==
In 2002, producers [[Walter F. Parkes]] and [[Laurie MacDonald]] produced the hit horror film, ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'', a remake of the Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''. They subsequently produced the film's successful [[sequel]] ''[[The Ring Two]]'' in 2005. Since first starting this new cycle of Asian horror film adaptations, Parkes and MacDonald searched for a project they felt was as ingeniously conceived and executed as ''The Ring'', and finally found it when producer [[Roy Lee]] brought the Korean film ''[[A Tale of Two Sisters]]'' to their attention.

When ''A Tale of Two Sisters'' played in US theaters, directors Tom and Charlie Guard had acquired the [[English language]] remake rights. The Guard Brothers had previously directed commercials and short films, and wanted to expand into feature films.

In June 2006, DreamWorks announced that a deal had been set up for the US version of ''A Tale of Two Sisters''. The new film was a presentation of DreamWorks and Cold Spring Pictures (''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]''), and was produced by Parkes, MacDonald and Lee. The screenplay was written by Craig Rosenberg (''[[After the Sunset]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''), [[Doug Miro]] and Carlo Bernard (''[[The Great Raid]]'').<ref>Scifi Japan(December 26, 2007).

In early 2008, the film, whose working title had been ''A Tale of Two Sisters'', was renamed to ''The Uninvited''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Announcement of title change |work=Fangoria.com |url=http://www.fangoria.com/news_article.php?id=6224}}</ref>

The film was released in North American and Canadian theaters on January 30, 2009.

===Shooting location===
Although the film is set in [[Maine]], it was shot in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. Most of the film was shot at one location, a waterfront property on [[British Columbia]]'s [[Bowen Island]], a short ferry ride west from [[Metro Vancouver|mainland Vancouver]].

Producer [[Walter F. Parkes]] said, of the shooting location:
{{cquote|''Eighty percent of the story takes place at the house, so we couldn't make the movie without the right one. It couldn't have been more important. We scouted [[Louisiana]], an environment which is both beautiful and slightly threatening. We had two houses which were terrible compromises, but both of them fell through. We had a difficult time finding anything that had both the connection to the story and the right logistical possibilities.''

''But then we were lucky to find in [[Canada]] a place that seemed as if it had been built for our movie. It was perfectly evocative and suggestive of a family that is both welcoming and forbidding. The fact that the house was within 30 miles of Vancouver was a greater plus than the minus of having to get everyone on boats to get them over there; water taxis and ferries are a way of life up there. In fact, I don’t remember ever having a more pleasant time on a location. Getting onto a boat and having a cup of coffee and then going up the little pier and the stairs we built, it focused us. We were isolated with one thing on our minds, which was making this movie. It was great.''<ref>Scifi Japan (December 26, 2008).

It is reported that a two-story boathouse in the film was built on the property overlooking the water just for several scenes. The cold water is rough and unappealing; it is a greenish-gray that crashes constantly and does not invite swimming.<ref name="shock">Heidi Martinuzzi(January 05, 2009).
