{{unsourced section|date=October 2014}}
The [[film]] is [[film director|directed]], [[film producer|produced]], [[screenwriter|written]] by and stars [[David Arquette]]. Arquette's then wife, [[Courteney Cox|Courteney Cox Arquette]], is also a producer and [[actor]] in the film. The title is a play on Ronald Reagan's nickname of "[[George Gipp|The Gipper]]".

In August 2007, writer-producer Fritz Jünker sued the Arquettes' [[production company]] Coquette Productions, Inc. for [[copyright infringement]], claiming Jünker's [[2001 in film|2001 film]], ''[http://www.thetruthaboutbeefjerky.com The Truth About Beef Jerky]'', was the basis for ''The Tripper''. The case never went to court, and was eventually dropped, because Jünker could not afford to take the case to court.  Coincidentally, or not, both films were shot at the same state park north of Santa Cruz, California, The Truth About Beef Jerky in 2001, and the Tripper several years later.
