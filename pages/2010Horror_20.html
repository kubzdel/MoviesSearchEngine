'''''Black Swan''''' is a 2010 American [[psychological horror]] film<ref>[http://video.tvguide.com/Direct+Effect/Darren+Aronofsky+of+BLACK+SWAN/8030735 "Direct Effect Season 1, Episode 7 Darren Aronofsky of BLACK SWAN".] Fox Movie Channel Originals.

The screenplay was written by [[Mark Heyman]], John McLaughlin, and Andres Heinz, based on an original story by Heinz. The film stars [[Natalie Portman]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Mila Kunis]], [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Winona Ryder]]. The plot revolves around a production of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'' ballet by a prestigious [[New York City]] [[ballet company]]. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.

Usually described as a psychological horror film, ''Black Swan'' can be also interpreted as a [[metaphor]] for achieving artistic perfection, with all the psychological and physical challenges one might encounter, i.e. "the film can be perceived as a poetic metaphor for the birth of an artist, that is, as a visual representation of Nina’s psychic odyssey toward achieving artistic perfection and of the price to be paid for it."<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2015) [https://www.amazon.com/Darren-Aronofskys-Films-Fragility-Hope/dp/1501306979/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8 Darren Aronofsky's Films and the Fragility of Hope], p. 96, [[Bloomsbury Academic]]</ref>

Aronofsky conceived the premise by connecting his viewings of a production of ''Swan Lake'' with an unrealized screenplay about [[Understudy|understudies]] and the notion of being haunted by a double, similar to the folklore surrounding [[doppelgänger]]s. Aronofsky cites [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]'' as another inspiration for the film. The director also considered ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to his 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', with both films involving demanding performances for different kinds of art. He and Portman first discussed the project in 2000, and after a brief attachment to [[Universal Studios]], ''Black Swan'' was produced in New York City in 2009 by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]]. Portman and Kunis trained in ballet for several months prior to filming, and notable figures from the ballet world helped with film production to shape the ballet presentation.

The film premiered as the opening film for the [[67th Venice International Film Festival]] on September 1, 2010. It had a [[limited release]] in the United States starting December 3, 2010 and opened in [[wide release]] on December 17. Portman's performance and Aronofsky's direction were praised. The film grossed $329 million worldwide. The film received five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]; Portman won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for the performance in the film, in addition to many other accolades. 

==Plot==
<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films are to be between 400 to 700 words. -->
Nina Sayers is a 28-year-old dancer in a [[New York City]] [[ballet company]], which is preparing to open its new season with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]''.  With prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre being forced into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer to portray the dual role of the innocent White Swan and the sensual Black Swan.  Nina auditions for the role and gives a flawless performance as the White Swan, but fails to embody the Black Swan.

The following day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider choosing her to play the role.  When he forcibly kisses her, she bites him before running out of his office.  Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and discovers, much to her surprise and that of her overprotective mother Erica, she will be portraying the lead.  At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth confronts Nina, accusing her of sleeping with Thomas to get the role.  The following day, Nina discovers that Beth was hit by a car while walking in the street and Thomas believes she did it on purpose.

During rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe new dancer Lily, whom he describes as possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina lacks.  Nina also falls victim to several hallucinations of a [[doppelgänger]] following her wherever she goes and finds unexplained scratch marks on her back.  One night, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to dinner despite Erica's objections. 

Over dinner, Lily offers Nina an [[MDMA|ecstasy]] capsule to help her relax. Nina turns it down, but later accepts a drink laced with ecstasy powder.  The two dance at a nightclub and return to Nina's apartment late.  After fighting with her mother, Nina barricades herself in her room and has sex with Lily.  The following morning, Nina wakes up alone and realizes she is late for the dress rehearsal.  Upon arriving at [[Lincoln Center]], she finds Lily dancing as the Black Swan and realizes that their encounter never took place. 

After learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate, Nina's hallucinations grow increasingly stronger to the point where Erica tries to prevent her from performing on opening night.  Nina forces her way out of the apartment and arrives at Lincoln Center only to discover that Lily is set to take over.  She confronts Thomas, who becomes so impressed by her confidence that he allows her to perform. 

During the end of the play’s second act, Nina becomes distracted by a hallucination, causing her partner to drop her.  She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing to play the Black Swan.  When Lily transforms into Nina's doppelgänger, the two engage in a fight that ends with Nina stabbing the doppelgänger with a shard of glass.  She hides the corpse and returns to the stage, where she loses herself and gives a flawless performance as the Black Swan. 

Nina receives a standing ovation from the audience and, after surprising Thomas with a passionate kiss, returns to her dressing room.  While changing, Nina hears a knock at the door and opens it to find Lily alive and congratulating her.  Realizing the fight never occurred, and yet the mirror is still broken, and that she stabbed herself, Nina quietly continues changing. 

After dancing the final act, in which the White Swan commits suicide by throwing herself off a cliff, Nina falls onto a hidden mattress.  As the theater erupts in thunderous applause, Thomas, Lily and the cast gather to congratulate Nina, only to discover that she is bleeding profusely.  Nina loses consciousness, but not before telling Thomas that her performance was perfect.

During the closing credits, the major cast members were credited both as their film characters as well as their corresponding characters from ''[[Swan Lake]]''.

[[Darren Aronofsky]] first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the [[High School of Performing Arts]] in New York City. The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called ''The Understudy'', which portrayed off-Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double. Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of ''[[All About Eve]]'', [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Tenant]]'', and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novella ''[[The Double (Dostoyevsky novel)|The Double]]''. The director had also seen numerous productions of ''Swan Lake'', and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script.<ref name="roles">{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna |first=Susan |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-blackswaninside22_ST_N.htm |title=''Black Swan'' stars step deftly into roles |work=USA Today |date=July 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5s9abMWwQ?url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-22-blackswaninside22_ST_N.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> When researching for the production of ''Black Swan'', Aronofsky found ballet to be "a very insular world" whose dancers were "not impressed by movies". Regardless, the director found active and inactive dancers to share their experiences with him. He also stood backstage to see the [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Bolshoi Ballet]] perform at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].<ref name="kisses">{{cite news|last=Ditzian |first=Eric |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646763/20100830/story.jhtml |title=''Black Swan'' Director Darren Aronofsky On Ballet, Natalie Portman And Lesbian Kisses |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sNCB5EQT?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1646763/20100830/story.jhtml |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

Aronofsky called ''Black Swan'' a companion piece to his previous film ''The Wrestler'', recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds as "too much for one movie". He compared the two films: "Wrestling some consider the lowest art—if they would even call it art—and ballet some people consider the highest art. But what was amazing to me was how similar the performers in both of these worlds are. They both make incredible use of their bodies to express themselves."<ref name="kisses"/> About the psychological thriller nature of ''Black Swan'', actress Natalie Portman compared the film's tone to Polanski's 1968 film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'',<ref>{{cite news|last=Wigler |first=Josh |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/05/natalie-portman-likens-black-swan-to-rosemarys-baby-in-terms-of-tone/ |title=Natalie Portman Likens ''Black Swan'' To ''Rosemary's Baby'' In Terms Of Tone |work=MTV Movies Blog |publisher=MTV |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rlueS6jv?url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/08/05/natalie-portman-likens-black-swan-to-rosemarys-baby-in-terms-of-tone/ |archivedate=August  6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> while Aronofsky said Polanski's ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''The Tenant'' (1976) were "big influences" on the final film.<ref name="kisses"/> Actor Vincent Cassel also compared ''Black Swan'' to Polanski's early works and additionally compared it to [[David Cronenberg]]'s early works.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buchanan |first=Kyle |url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/08/vincent-cassel-on-mesrine-black-swan-and-acting-you-need-a-hard-on-perpetually.php?page=3 |title=Vincent Cassel on ''Mesrine'', ''Black Swan'', and Acting |work=[[Movieline]] |date=August 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sK8q2fXY?url=http://www.movieline.com/2010/08/vincent-cassel-on-mesrine-black-swan-and-acting-you-need-a-hard-on-perpetually.php?page=3 |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

Portman and Kunis started training six months before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers.<ref name="roles"/> Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming.

{{Quote|I like Super 16 because the cameras are really light, really moveable. Also, for ''The Wrestler'' it was a money-saving thing. The film stocks on 35mm would become so glossy that they'd get close to what people are doing on video. I wanted to go back to the grainy, ''vérité'' feel of ''The Wrestler'' ... Like with wrestling, ballet is shot in wide shot with two shots on the side, and no one really brought the camera—well, wrestling—into the ring or for us, onto the stage and into the practice room. I really wanted the camera to dance, but I was nervous about shooting a psychological thriller/horror film with a hand-held camera.

===Controversies===

====Costume design====
Amy Westcott is credited as the costume designer and received several award nominations. A publicized controversy arose regarding the question of who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers. An article in the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' suggested those costumes had actually been created by [[Rodarte]]'s Kate and Laura Mulleavy.<ref>{{cite news|title=Feathers ruffled over Black Swan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/news/feathers-ruffled-over-black-swan-2192042.html |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Susie |last=Mesure |date=January 23, 2011}}</ref> Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes, among them the Black and White Swan, had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte, Westcott, and Aronofsky. Furthermore, the corps ballet's costumes were designed by Zack Brown (for the American Ballet Theatre), and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department. Westcott said: "Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self-publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized how good the film is."<ref>{{cite web|title=Black Swan: Amy Westcott Interview |url=http://clothesonfilm.com/black-swan-amy-westcott-interview/18997/ |accessdate=January 30, 2011 |publisher=Clothes On Film |first=Chris |last=Laverty |date=January 28, 2011}}</ref>

The critic also commended Cassel, Kunis, and Hershey in their supporting roles, particularly comparing Hershey to [[Ruth Gordon]] in the role of "the desperate, jealous mother".

Kirk Honeycutt of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a mixed review. He wrote, "[''Black Swan''] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, visually complex film whose badness is what's so good about it. You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible." Honeycutt commended Millepied's "sumptuous" choreography and Libatique's "darting, weaving" camera work. The critic said of the thematic mashup, "Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements to the world of ballet ... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Honeycutt |first=Kirk |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/black-swan-film-review-1004112184.story |title=Black Swan&nbsp;– Film Review |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 1, 2010}}</ref> Similarly, in a piece for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', [[Rob Kirkpatrick]] praised Portman's performance but compared the film's story to that of ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) and ''[[Burlesque (2010 musical film)|Burlesque]]'' (2010) while concluding ''Black Swan'' is "simply higher-priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [''Burlesque'' director Steve] Antin's cheddar.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-kirkpatrick/burlesque-and-black-swan_b_806378.html |title=Burlesque and Black Swan: The Showgirls of Burlesque vs. the Showgirls of Ballet? |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |first=Rob |last=Kirkpatrick |date=January 14, 2011}}</ref>

The film has been criticized for its portrayal of ballet and ballet dancers.
