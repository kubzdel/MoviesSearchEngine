==Plot==
{{More plot|date=March 2018}}

In 1815 California, Father Michael, an emissary of [[Pope Pius VII]], has traveled to meet with novice monk Brother Tomas. The young monk's order serves as the secret repository for evil, supernatural objects collected by the Church, and kept there for safekeeping. Michael delivers an ancient statue that has trapped two beautiful female demons, Munkar and Nakir. Tomas and his friend Brother Gregory inadvertently release the murderous demons, who travel to the 21st century using the monastery's Wheel of Time. To redeem himself, Tomas pursues them to present-day [[Seattle]], Washington, where he allies with police detective Rachel Dressler to recapture the homicidal terrors.
