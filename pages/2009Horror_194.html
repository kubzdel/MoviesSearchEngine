The film's investors were concerned that ''Smash Cut'' would be hindered by the proposed [[Income Tax Amendments Act, 2006]] law (Bill C-10) that could restrict tax benefits for films whose content the federal government deemed objectionable.<ref name=imagination-llc.com /> These concerns were particularly prompted by the casting of Sasha Grey, but director Lee Demarbre retorted, "I don't want to make a porn movie. I want to make a movie with Sasha Grey. I want to take her right out of the porn genre."<ref name=Playback />
