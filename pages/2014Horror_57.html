== Production ==
Writer-director Hewlett was inspired by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which he saw as a child.  Hewlett said that he wanted to make a film from the point of view of [[HAL 9000]], the antagonist of that story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2013-2-20/david-hewlett-my-secret-plans-stargate-atlantis-movie-more|title=David Hewlett: My secret plans for a Stargate Atlantis movie + more|last=Hewlett|first=David|work=[[Blastr]]|date=2013-02-20|accessdate=2014-09-28}}</ref>  This idea was eventually rejected as too artistic, and the plot was retooled to be more similar to ''[[Final Destination]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/106025/exclusive-interview-with-david-hewlett-on-debug/|title=Exclusive Interview with David Hewlett on Debug|last=Wilson|first=Staci Layne|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=2015-06-09|accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>  Hewlett said that he did not see HAL 9000 as evil, and he designed Iam to be defending his right to exist.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2015-06-09/dvdanger-debug/|title=DVDanger: Debug|last=Whittaker|first=Richard|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=2015-06-09}}</ref>  Hewlett intentionally cast Momoa as the ship's AI [[Typecasting (acting)|against type]].  Momoa wanted to do a project different than his traditional roles, and Hewlett was impressed with Momoa's creativity and range; the two men had previously worked together on the sci-fi series ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.  Although there were concerns about the AI's name, Iam, Hewlett settled the disputes by stating that names are inherently subjective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-3-31/exclusive-david-hewlett-stargate-and-what-sci-fi-needs-now|title=EXCLUSIVE: David Hewlett on Stargate and what sci-fi needs now|last=Huddleston|first=Kathie|work=[[Blastr]]|date=2014-03-31|accessdate=2014-09-28}}</ref>
