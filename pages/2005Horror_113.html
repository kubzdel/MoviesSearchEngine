In [[Ancient Egypt]], there once reigned the malevolent Queen Aneh-Tet ([[Claudia Lynx]]), who ruled Egypt with an iron fist, terrorising the populace and slaughtering her enemies. Upon her death, her body was cursed, and buried in a secret location.

In the modern day, an archaeological team uncovers Aneh-Tet's [[sarcophagus]], and accidentally unleashes her evil onto the world.
