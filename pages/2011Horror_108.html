'''''Megan Is Missing''''' is a 2011 [[United States|American]] [[Psychological horror|psychological horror film]] edited, co-produced, written and directed by [[Michael Goi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FEATURE: "MEGAN IS MISSING" Surfing the Internet is a deadly trip in Michael Goi’s chilling cautionary tale.|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/home/all-news/6631-first-look-fangoria-312-cover-and-contents|publisher=Fangoria #312|accessdate=8 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001203604/http://www.fangoria.com/index.php/home/all-news/6631-first-look-fangoria-312-cover-and-contents|archivedate=1 October 2013|df=}}</ref> The film revolves around the days leading up to the disappearance of Megan Stewart (Rachel Quinn), a popular high school student in North Hollywood that decided to meet a boy that she was interacting with online in person, and the subsequent investigation launched by her best friend Amy Herman (Amber Perkins). The film is presented by way of "[[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]".<ref>{{cite web|title=TIFF: Anchor Bay Buys 'Megan is Missing'|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/tiff-anchor-bay-buys-megan-missing-20932|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref> 

Although filmed in 2006, the film did not find distribution until [[Anchor Bay Entertainment|Anchor Bay Films]] released it direct to DVD in 2011. Marketed as an educational film, upon its May 2011 release, ''Megan Is Missing'' was banned in [[New Zealand]], and was heavily criticized by critics for its exploitative nature, the graphic violence inflicted upon the child protagonists, and for oversexualizing the lives of young teenage girls. Despite causing controversy, the film has been praised for bringing awareness to the seriousness of the situation and for depicting it in a realistic manner.

Goi based the film on a series of real life cases of child abduction and emphasized that his reason for highlighting the violence was to unnerve people in order for the viewer to understand the modern risks that children are exposed to online. Goi wrote the script in ten days and shot the film over the course of a week. Because of the graphic content, he requested that the parents of the predominantly young cast were on set during filming so that they were fully aware of their children's involvement in the project.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Found Footage Horror Films: Fear and the Appearance of Reality|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandra|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=9780786470778|location=|pages=56}}</ref>

==Plot==
Megan Stewart, a popular 14-year old girl, is well known and liked among her peers and is an [[Honors student|honors student]]. However, Megan lives a double life — she is a drug addict, a victim of [[Child sexual abuse|child sexual abuse]], and has a turbulent relationship with her mother, who never forgave Megan for reporting her husband to authorities for molesting her at 9 years old, which led to his imprisonment. Amy Herman, her innocent best friend, is an outcast who doesn't want to fully let go of her childhood which causes her to be ridiculed by Megan's more troublesome friends. 

Amy, struggling with her insecurities, clings to her relationship with Megan as a lifeline to social acceptance. The two regularly communicate by web chat cameras or cell phone. While talking to one of her friends via web cam, Megan is introduced to a 17-year-old boy named Josh in a chatroom. Desperate for love and approval, Megan finds herself intrigued and attracted to him. On January 14, 2007, Megan goes to meet Josh in person behind a diner, and she is never seen again. Police investigate her disappearance, but soon begin to give up after finding few leads and begin to assume she simply ran away.

However, Amy believes otherwise and talks online with Josh to find out if he knows about Megan's fate. She finds his answers regarding her suspicious. After seeing security footage of her kidnapping, Amy tells the police about Josh and his possible involvement in her disappearance, which re-sparks the investigation. Josh confronts Amy and threatens her, saying he is watching her. Subsequently, disturbing images of Megan being tortured while immobilized in a contraption begin to appear on an online fetish forum. Three weeks after her disappearance, Amy visits a personal hiding spot underneath an old bridge where she and Megan used to tell each other secrets and begins to record a video diary. Right before the video ends, someone is seen about to grab her. It is revealed that Amy had disappeared as well. Investigators find her video camera in a garbage can near her hiding spot.

In unedited footage found on the camera, Josh unlocks a large door in a basement where he has been hiding Amy, in her underwear and chained to the wall. He makes her eat food in a dog bowl before he violently rapes her. He later returns to apologize, and says he will let her go. He then shows her a barrel and tells her to get into it so that she will not know where he lives when they leave. After Josh opens up the barrel, Amy runs away screaming as she sees Megan's rotting corpse inside. Josh grabs Amy and forces her into the barrel along with Megan's body before locking it. He loads the barrel into the car and then drives to a forest, where he digs a large hole as Amy screams and begs for her life. Josh pushes the barrel into the hole and fills it up before walking away, leaving Amy to die.

During the ending credits, a clip shows Megan and Amy relaxing on a bed together, talking about their plans for the future.

==Ban in New Zealand==
In October 2011, the New Zealand Censorship Board (OFLC) banned Anchor Bay's release of this film by classifying it as 'objectionable'. They claimed that it contained sexual violence and sexual conduct involving young people to such an extent and degree, and in such a manner that if it was released it would be 'injurious to the public good'. They went on to say that it relished in the spectacle of one girl's ordeal, including a three-minute rape scene. They also stated that it sexualized the lives of young teenage girls to a 'highly exploitative degree'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melonfarmers.com/inap11d.htm#Megan_is_Objectionable_4061|title=Asia Pacific Censorship News: Megan Is Objectionable...
