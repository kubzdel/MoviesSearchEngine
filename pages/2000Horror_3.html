'''''American Psycho''''' is a 2000 American [[black comedy]] [[horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Mary Harron]], based on [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s 1991 [[American Psycho|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{cite |title=American Psycho (2000) |work=[[Allmovie]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v184482 |accessdate=July 17, 2016}}</ref> It stars [[Christian Bale]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Cara Seymour]], [[Justin Theroux]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]].

Producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] purchased the film rights to the novel in 1992. After discussions with [[David Cronenberg]] fell through, Harron was brought on to direct and cast Bale in the lead role. Lionsgate acquired worldwide distribution in 1997 and temporarily replaced Harron and Bale with [[Oliver Stone]] as director and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] portraying Patrick Bateman. DiCaprio left in favor of ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' and Harron and Bale were brought back. ''American Psycho'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2000, and was released theatrically on April 14, 2000. The film was a financial success and received generally positive reviews: the screenplay and Bale's performance were singled out for praise, while criticism focused on its disturbing and violent imagery.

==Plot==
In 1987, wealthy New York investment banker [[Patrick Bateman]]'s life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiancée Evelyn and his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. Bateman describes the material accoutrements of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise, beautification routine, designer wardrobe and expensive furniture. He also discusses his music collection, which includes [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Whitney Houston]]. 

Bateman and his associates flaunt their [[business cards]] in a display of vanity. Enraged by the superiority of co-worker Paul Allen's card, Bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. At a Christmas party, Bateman makes plans to have dinner with Paul, who mistakes Bateman for another coworker, Marcus Halberstram. Bateman gets Paul drunk and lures him back to his apartment. While playing "[[Hip to Be Square]]" on the stereo, Bateman delivers a monologue to Paul about the artistic merits of the song and of [[Huey Lewis and the News]], then murders him with an axe. He disposes of Paul's body, and then goes to his apartment to stage the situation so that others believe Paul has run off to London.

Bateman is later interviewed about Paul's disappearance in his office by private detective Donald Kimball. During the night, Bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] after they moved away from [[progressive rock]] toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. After they have sex, Bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for torture. In the next scene, they leave his apartment bruised and bloodied.

The next day, Bateman's colleague Luis Carruthers reveals his new business card. Bateman tries to kill Luis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. Luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for Bateman, who flees in disgust. After murdering a model, Bateman invites his secretary, Jean, to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks before. When Jean arrives, Bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nailgun to the back of her head while the two converse. When he receives an answering machine message from his fiancée, Evelyn, he asks Jean to leave. Kimball meets Bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion.

Bateman has a threesome with his friend Elizabeth and Christie at Paul's apartment, and kills Elizabeth during sex. Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses as she searches for an exit. A naked Bateman chases her while wielding a chainsaw, and drops it on her, killing her.

Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn. That night, as he uses an ATM, he finds a stray kitten. The ATM displays the text "feed me a stray cat". As he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. A police chase ensues but Bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. Fleeing to his office, Bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. In an office he believes is his, Bateman calls his lawyer Harold and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on Harold's answering machine.

The following morning, Bateman visits Paul's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it's vacant and for sale. The [[realtor]] tells him to leave. As Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified Jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation and rape in Bateman's office journal.

Bateman sees Harold at a restaurant and mentions the phone message he left the other night. Harold mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with Paul in London days earlier. A confused Bateman returns to his friends. In a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, and that there has been no [[catharsis]]: "This confession has meant nothing".

==Production==
Producer Edward R. Pressman purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s novel ''American Psycho'' in 1992, with [[Johnny Depp]] expressing an interest in the lead role.<ref name=Norton/> After discussions with [[Stuart Gordon]] to direct fell through, [[David Cronenberg]] became attached and brought Ellis to adapt the novel into a screenplay. The process was difficult for Ellis, due to Cronenberg's scene constraints and not wanting to use any of Ellis's restaurant or nightclub material from the novel. The script ended with an elaborate musical sequence to [[Barry Manilow]]'s "[[Daybreak (Barry Manilow song)|Daybreak]]" atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. "I'm glad it wasn't shot, but that kind of shows you where I was when I was writing the script", Ellis reflected. "I was bored with the material."<ref name=Movieline>{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|work=Movieline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref> Cronenberg was still listed as being attached to direct in March 1994, but with a new script by [[Norman Snider]].<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |url= https://variety.com/1994/film/news/disney-wins-houston-and-washington-teaming-119623/|title=Disney wins Houston and Washington teaming …|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 2, 1994|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>

Harron refused to meet with DiCaprio, displeased as she specifically chose Bale and believed DiCaprio's screen presence would have been too boyish for Patrick Bateman. She also believed the actor's reputation as a teen idol following ''[[Romeo + Juliet (1996 film)|Romeo + Juliet]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would distract from ''American Psycho'''s production and tone.<ref name=Norton/>

Lionsgate was planning to increase the production budget to $40 million in the hopes of securing DiCaprio's $21 million asking price.<ref name=payday>{{cite news|first1=Dan|last1=Cox|first2=Benedict|last2=Carver|url=https://variety.com/1998/more/news/di-caprio-in-21-mil-payday-1117470905/|title=Di Caprio in $21 mil payday|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 17, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref> At the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], a press release was issued that DiCaprio had taken the offer,<ref name=castingleo/> which was quickly rebutted by DiCaprio's manager, Rick Yorn, who claimed the actor had simply expressed interest in the part.

Working from a new script written by Matthew Markwalder, Stone was brought aboard, whom Harron called "probably the single worst single person to do it". The director wanted to eliminate the satire from Harron's script, emphasizing the psychological character traits of Patrick Bateman. However, Stone could not agree on the film's direction with DiCaprio, who decided to star in ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' instead.<ref name=Norton/>

Bale remained committed, turning down other movie roles and auditions for nine months, confident DiCaprio would depart.<ref name=Norton/> Lionsgate made an offer to [[Ewan McGregor]], who turned it down after Bale personally urged him to do so.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Heaf|url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2011-04/26/gq-film-christian-bale-interview|title=Christian Bale: behind the mask|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> Harron and Bale were eventually brought back under the agreement that the budget would not exceed $10 million.<ref name=Norton>{{cite news|first=Nina|last=Gopalan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/fiction.breteastonellis| title=American Psycho: the story behind the film|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 23, 2000|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref> Bale spent several months working out by himself, and then three hours a day with a trainer during pre-production, to achieve the proper physique for the [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] Bateman.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/06/artsfeatures| title = The method in my madness|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=April 6, 2000|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> The actor struggled with the role until he noticed [[Tom Cruise]] in an interview on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', being struck by Cruise's energy and "intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes".<ref>{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Heritage | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/oct/23/tom-cruise-christian-bale-american-psycho|title=Who other than Tom Cruise has inspired Christian Bale? |work =[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate = February 24, 2015}}</ref> Bale also used [[Nicolas Cage]]'s performance in ''[[Vampire's Kiss]]'' as inspiration for this role.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harrison |last=Cheung| title=Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman |year=2012 |publisher=BenBella Books |location=Dallas, Texas| isbn=1936661640 |page=166}}</ref> Filming began in March 1999 in Toronto, Canada.<ref name="Norton" />

==Marketing==
As promotion, one could register to receive e-mails "from" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his [[Therapy|therapist]].<ref name="Howell">{{cite news |first= Peter| last= Howell | url= | title=''American Psycho''s Web Promo Sickens Star | work=[[Toronto Star]] | location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=March 8, 2000 | accessdate= March 18, 2018}}</ref> The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by the book's author Bret Easton Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. He discusses such developments as his marriage to (and impending divorce settlement with) his former secretary, Jean, his complete adoration of his son, Patrick Jr., and his efforts to triumph over his business rivals. The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus. However, the film's star, Christian Bale, was not happy with this kind of marketing: "My main objection is that some people think it will be me returning those e-mails. I don't like that ...  I think the movie stands on its own merits and should attract an audience that can appreciate intelligent satire. It's not a slasher flick, but it's also not ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. The marketing should reflect that."<ref name="Howell"/>

Lionsgate spent $50,000 on an online stock market game, ''Make a Killing with American Psycho'', which invited players to invest in films, actors, or musicians using fake Hollywood money. This marketing ploy did little to help the film's box office but the studio's co-president [[Tom Ortenberg]] still claimed that it was a success: "The aim was to gain exposure and awareness for the picture, and we did that," he said. "Lionsgate will make a tidy profit on the picture."<ref name="guardian">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/05/news1 | title=Greed appeal fails to lift ''American Psycho'' | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England| date=5 May 2000 | accessdate=7 July 2007}}</ref>

==Soundtrack==
The [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack for the film]] was [[Film score|scored]] by [[John Cale]], with artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[The Cure]], and [[New Order (band)|New Order]].<ref>{{cite web|title=American Psycho|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack|website=IMDb}}</ref> The [[Huey Lewis and the News]] song "[[Hip to Be Square]]" appears in the film and was initially intended to be on the soundtrack album, but was removed from the album due to lack of publishing rights.<ref name=guardian2>{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/13/news |title=''American Psycho'' soundtrack in hot water |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group| location=London, England| date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> As a result, [[Koch Records]] was forced to recall approximately 100,000 copies of the album which were destroyed. Koch Records president Bob Frank said, "As a result of the violent nature of the film, Huey Lewis's management decided not to give the soundtrack clearance".<ref name="guardian2" /> Lewis' manager Bob Brown claimed that the musician had not seen the film and that "we knew nothing about a soundtrack album. They just went ahead and put the cut on there. I think what they're trying to do is drum up publicity for themselves".<ref name="guardian2" /> In a 2013 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Lewis stated that the violence in the movie played no part in the decision not to allow the song to be included on the soundtrack. He reiterated Bob Brown's earlier denial stating "It was in the ''USA Today'' and everywhere else. It said, 'Huey Lewis saw the movie and it was so violent that he pulled his tune from the soundtrack.' It was completely made up."<ref>{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Greene|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/huey-lewis-on-30-years-of-sports-our-15-minutes-were-a-real-15-minutes-20130517|title=Huey Lewis on 30 Years of 'Sports': 'Our 15 Minutes Were a Real 15 Minutes'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|location=San Francisco, California|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=July 3, 2014}}</ref> In addition, prior to the start of principal photography, [[Whitney Houston]] refused to allow the use of her performance of the song "[[The Greatest Love of All]]" in the film; her version was replaced by an easy-listening orchestrated version.<ref name="guardian2" />

[[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film at No. 19 in its list of the "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article praising "Christian Bale's disturbing/darkly hilarious turn as serial killer/Manhattan businessman Patrick Bateman, a role that in hindsight couldn't have been played by any other actor. ... At its best, the film reflects our own narcissism, and the shallow American culture it was spawned from, with piercing effectiveness. Much of the credit for this can go to director Mary Harron, whose off-kilter tendencies are a good complement to Ellis' unique style."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 4|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208164216/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|archivedate=February 8, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Author Ellis said, "''American Psycho'' was a book I didn't think needed to be turned into a movie", as "the medium of film demands answers", which would make the book "infinitely less interesting".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |title=Bret Easton Ellis talks film adaptations at SCAD |publisher=[[Creative Loafing]] |accessdate=2010-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624060251/http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |archivedate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}</ref> He also said that while the book attempted to add ambiguity to the events and to Bateman's reliability as a narrator, the film appeared to make them completely literal before confusing the issue at the very end.<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|publisher=Movieline|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2013-03-28}}</ref> On a 2014 appearance on the ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' podcast, Ellis indicated that his feelings towards the film were more mixed than negative; he reiterated his opinion that his conception of Bateman as an unreliable narrator did not make an entirely successful transition from page to screen, adding that Bateman's narration was so unreliable that even ''he'', as the author of the book, didn't know if Bateman was honestly describing events that actually happened or if he was lying or even hallucinating. However, Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel's violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he'd intended, and liked that it gave his novel "a second life" in introducing it to new readers. Ultimately, Ellis said "the movie was okay, the movie was fine. I just didn't think it needed to be made."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_552_-_bret_easton_ellis|title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast   - Episode 552 - Bret Easton Ellis|work=wtfpod.com}}</ref>

The film currently holds a 68% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the consensus states "If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, ''American Psycho'' still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale."<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|american_psycho|American Psycho}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Psycho|url=http://www.boldstriped.com/tags/american-psycho|accessdate=30 May 2012}}</ref>

A Special Edition [[DVD]] was released on July 21, 2005.<ref>http://www.ign.com/movies/american-psycho/dvd-758290</ref> In the U.S., two versions of the film have been released: an R-rated and Unrated Version. For the edited version and [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] cinematic release in the [[United States]], the producers excised about 18 seconds of footage from a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two [[prostitutes]]. Some dialogue was also edited: Bateman orders a prostitute, Christie, to bend over so that another, Sabrina, can "see your asshole", which was edited to "see your ass". The unedited version also shows Bateman receiving [[oral sex]] from Christie. The uncut version was released on [[Blu-ray]] on February 6, 2007.<ref>http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-Blu-ray/135/</ref>

===Sequel===
A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', directed by [[Morgan J. Freeman]] and starring [[Mila Kunis]], was released in 2002. The sequel's only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback. The film was denounced by ''American Psycho'' author [[Bret Easton Ellis]].<ref>{{cite web| url =http://movies.ign.com/articles/304/304429p1.html| title=Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out  | publisher=IGN | date=August 21, 2001 |accessdate = August 22, 2010 }}</ref> In 2005, star [[Mila Kunis]] expressed embarrassment over the film, and spoke out against the idea of a sequel. "Please—somebody stop this", she said. "Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn't know it would be ''American Psycho II''. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh&nbsp;... I don't know.
