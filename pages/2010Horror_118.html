''Orr Eravuu'' was produced by one of the directors Hari Shankar under the banner Shankar Bros; it was the studio's first film project. The film was initially titled as ''Eraaa'', before it was renamed.<ref>http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/apr-10-03/orr-iravu-avm-22-04-10.html</ref>

The crew had been involved in the study of paranormal procedures, been working on field with [[Ouija]] board (wee-gee board), [[electronic voice phenomenon]], [[EMF meter]]s, micro cassette recorder and much more scientific instruments. Also they involved at night shoots in the locations which were broadly believed to be [[Haunted house|haunted]]. Notably, all technicians who worked in this venture were newcomers.

[[Sathish. G]] played the lead role and handled the cinematography as well, shooting in [[point of view shot|Point-of-View]] and using [[shaky camera]]work. Sathish. G had designed his own rig to fix the camera at the level of human's eye and shot the whole film, assembling the rig on his head with the Sony HD Camera. With this camera setup, he walks, drives, climbs, runs, performs all the paranormal tests and takes the audience into the scene. Since the film was made in digital, Hari Shankar decided to have a sophisticated Edit Setup and preferred to use the Apple Systems. The entire film was edited in Apple [[Final Cut Pro]] with the true HD resolution 1080p. The sound was recorded live to make the audience feel the real ambience of the scene. The [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] sound was mixed in the A. M. Studios by Shiva Kumar and Kannan.

==Music==
The music was scored by K. Venkat Prabu Shankar. Although, the film was planned to be released without any film score and only a [[theme music]] at the end credits, the crew decided that to include a score to elevate the tension. The theme of the score is based on 3 states of matter; solitariness, seeking and terror. The music was scored giving high priority to silence, live sound and the visuals. The film features one song that was supposedly penned by the spirit of legendary poet [[Kannadasan]], through a medium, C. M. Rathnasamy, who has vast experience in this field of spirit interaction for nearly 30 years.<ref>http://www.hindu.com/fr/2010/06/18/stories/2010061850690200.htm</ref> The song was composed and performed by Sathish Kumar. The song includes the narration of the classic Tamil play ''Harichandra'' in which the lead character lives as a grave digger, describing the practice of funeral according to the good or bad life of the dead.

The soundtrack consists of three songs.

#"Ucchi Malayil" - composed and performed by Sam C.S.
#"Kaadhala" - composed by Sam C.S. and performed by Mancy and Sam C.S.
#"Naan Oru Netraya Nayagan" - composed by Sathish Kumar and performed by [[Benny Dayal]].
