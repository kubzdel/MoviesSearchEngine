Cassandra once dreamt of her mother's death, only to have the dream come true in shockingly accurate detail. Now, several years later, the dreams return, each involving some of her friends from high school. In a desperate attempt to save them, she invites them all to a weekend getaway where she hopes to warn them of their fate and save their lives. However, death doesn't always stick to the plan as Cassie soon finds out. Her friends began to die in horrible and painful ways, but not the ways she dreamt of.
